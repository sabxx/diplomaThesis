It had ever been her, sign that she was, for all occasions, FOUND ready, without loose, ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities; a, suggestion of the swept and garnished, in her whole splendid, yet, thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting, that, reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry, for, objects with their backs to the walls, and spoke even of some, probable reference, in her American blood, to dusting and, polishing New England grandmothers. If her apartment was, \\\"princely,\\\" in the clearness of the lingering day, she looked as, if she had been carried there prepared, all attired and, decorated, like some holy image in a procession, and left\\n\\nFor a minute after this they remained face to face; Maggie had, sprung up while her friend sat enthroned, and, after moving to, and fro in her intensity, now paused to receive the light she had, invoked. It had accumulated, considerably, by this time, round, Mrs. Assingham's ample presence, and it made, even to our young, woman's own sense, a medium in which she could at last take a, deeper breath. \\\"I've affected you, these months--and these last, weeks in especial--as quiet and natural and easy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For your father. For whom else?\\\" They looked at each other hard, now, but Maggie's face took refuge in the intensity of her, interest. She was not at all even so stupid as to treat her, companion's question as requiring an answer; a discretion that, her controlled stillness had after an instant justified. \\\"I, must risk your thinking me selfish--for of course you know what, it involves. Let me admit it--I AM selfish. I place my husband, first.\\\"\\n\\nHe saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could, at the, best, but stand aside to watch her and let her pass; he only made, a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture. \\\"I'm, sorry to say any ill of your friends, and the thing was a long, time ago; besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it., But I remember the man's striking me as a decided little beast.\\\"\\n\\nYes, Charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar, and had, stopped now to put her further attention to the test. Her face, was fixed on her, through the night; she was the creature who had, escaped by force from her cage, yet there was in her whole motion, assuredly, even as so dimly discerned, a kind of portentous, intelligent stillness. She had escaped with an intention, but, with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with, quiet measures. The two women, at all events, only hovered there\\n\\nbut there was something in such an appearance, in the look it put, into the eyes, that renewed Maggie's conviction of what this, companion had been expecting. She had been watching it come, come, from afar, and now that it was there, after all, and the first, convulsion over, they would doubtless soon find themselves in a, more real relation. It was there because of the Sunday luncheon, they had partaken of alone together; it was there, as strangely, as one would, because of the bad weather, the cold perverse June, rain, that was making the day wrong; it was there because it, stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among, which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her, steps; it was there because Amerigo and Charlotte were again, paying together alone a \\\"week end\\\" visit which it had been, Maggie's plan infernally to promote--just to see if, this time\\n\\nany slightest value, of consciousness; and then felt the slow, surge of a vision that, at the end of another minute or two, had, floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at, a picture, an early Florentine sacred subject, that he had given, her on her marriage. He might have been, in silence, taking his, last leave of it; it was a work for which he entertained, she, knew, an unqualified esteem. The tenderness represented for her, by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become, to her sense, a, part of the whole infusion, of the immortal expression; the, beauty of his sentiment looked out at her, always, from the, beauty of the rest, as if the frame made positively a window for, his spiritual face: she might have said to herself, at this, moment, that in leaving the thing behind him, held as in her, clasping arms, he was doing the most possible toward leaving her, a part of his palpable self. She put her hand over his shoulder\\n\\nShe had considered here, and never in her life had she considered, so promptly and so intently. If she really put it that way, her, husband, challenged, might belie the statement; so that what, would that do but make her father wonder, make him perhaps ask, straight out, why she was exerting pressure? She couldn't of, course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting, pressure; which was why she was obliged only to make answer:, \\\"Wouldn't that be just what you must have out with HIM?\\\"\\n\\nIt was not till many days had passed that the Princess began to, accept the idea of having done, a little, something she was not, always doing, or indeed that of having listened to any inward, voice that spoke in a new tone. Yet these instinctive, postponements of reflection were the fruit, positively, of, recognitions and perceptions already active; of the sense, above, all, that she had made, at a particular hour, made by the mere, touch of her hand, a difference in the situation so long present, to her as practically unattackable. This situation had been, occupying, for months and months, the very centre of the garden, of her life, but it had reared itself there like some strange\\n\\nhad its hours of strange beguilement--those at which her sense, for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her, communion with him more intimate than any other. It COULDN'T but, pass between them that something singular was happening--so much, as this she again and again said to herself; whereby the comfort, of it was there, after all, to be noted, just as much as the, possible peril, and she could think of the couple they formed, together as groping, with sealed lips, but with mutual looks that, had never been so tender, for some freedom, some fiction, some, figured bravery, under which they might safely talk of it. The, moment was to come--and it finally came with an effect as, penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric, button--when she read the least helpful of meanings into the, agitation she had created. The merely specious description of, their case would have been that, after being for a long time, as, a family, delightfully, uninterruptedly happy, they had still had, a new felicity to discover; a felicity for which, blessedly, her, father's appetite and her own, in particular, had been kept fresh, and grateful. This livelier march of their intercourse as a whole, was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching, instinct we have glanced at; very much as if he had said to her\\n\\non their second and shorter interview, in Portland Place, and, quite at the end of this passage, she had imagined him positively, proposing to her a temporary accommodation. It had been but the, matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed, upon her, and she had found in it, the more she kept it before, her, the tacitly-offered sketch of a working arrangement. \\\"Leave, me my reserve; don't question it--it's all I have, just now\\n\\nwhere she had the thrill of seeing it, with the violence of the, crash, lie shattered. She had flushed with the force of her, effort, as Maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight, and this, high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them, for a minute more. After which, \\\"Whatever you meant by it--and I, don't want to know NOW--has ceased to exist,\\\" Mrs. Assingham, said.\\n\\ninvariably, the sense of making her danger present, of making it, real, to her husband, and of his almost turning pale, when their, eyes met, at this possibility of their compromised state and, their shared discredit. The beauty was that, as under a touch of, one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard, he sounded, out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man., \\\"Conspiring--so far as YOU were concerned--to what end?\\\"\\n\\nAt this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet, her opportunity to say, and it held her for a minute as in a, vise, her impression of his now, with his strained smile, which, touched her to deepest depths, sounding her in his secret unrest., This was the moment, in the whole process of their mutual, vigilance, in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their, thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch. It shook, between them, this transparency, with their very breath; it was, an exquisite tissue, but stretched on a frame, and would give way, the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard. She held, her breath, for she knew by his eyes, the light at the heart of, which he couldn't blind, that he was, by his intention, making, sure--sure whether or no her certainty was like his. The, intensity of his dependence on it at that moment--this itself was, what absolutely convinced her so that, as if perched up before, him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his, observation, she balanced for thirty seconds, she almost rocked:, she might have been for the time, in all her conscious person\\n\\nwith a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism, to, each member of the party in turn; sustaining and bracing herself, by her emphasis, pushed even to an amiable cynicism, of the, confident view of these punctualities of the Assinghams. The, ground she could best occupy, to her sense, was that of her being, moved, as in this connexion she had always been moved, by the, admitted grossness of her avidity, the way the hospitality of the, Ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease, destitute, as the Colonel had kept her, from the first, of any rustic, retreat, any leafy bower of her own, any fixed base for the stale, season now at hand. She had explained at home, she had repeatedly, reexplained, the terms of her dilemma, the real difficulty of, her, or--as she now put it--of their, position. When the pair, could do nothing else, in Cadogan Place, they could still talk of, marvellous little Maggie, and of the charm, the sinister charm\\n\\nShe saw him, in truth, less easily beguiled--saw him wander, in, the closed dusky rooms, from place to place, or else, for long, periods, recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the, smoke of ceaseless cigarettes. She made him out as liking better, than anything in the world just now to be alone with his, thoughts. Being herself connected with his thoughts, she, continued to believe, more than she had ever been, it was thereby, a good deal as if he were alone with HER. She made him out as, resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which, he was exposed at Fawns; and she was accessible to the impression, of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative. It was like, his doing penance in sordid ways--being sent to prison or being, kept without money; it wouldn't have taken much to make her think, of him as really kept without food. He might have broken away\\n\\nvisibly, so much her friend as at that moment--had braced herself, to so amazing an energy, and there, under Amerigo's eyes, she, picked up the shining pieces. Bedizened and jewelled, in her, rustling finery, she paid, with humility of attitude, this prompt, tribute to order--only to find, however, that she could carry but, two of the fragments at once. She brought them over to the, chimney-piece, to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup, before Fanny's appropriation of it, and, after laying them, carefully down, went back for what remained, the solid detached, foot. With this she returned to the mantel-shelf, placing it with, deliberation in the centre and then, for a minute, occupying, herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels. After she, had squared again her little objects on the chimney, she was, within an ace, in fact, of turning on him with that appeal;, besides its being lucid for her, all the while, that the occasion, was passing, that they were dining out, that he wasn't dressed\\n\\nwhen the particular question had come up for them the then, purblind discussion of which, at their enjoyed leisure, Maggie, had formed the habit of regarding as the \\\"first beginning\\\" of, their present situation. The whirligig of time had thus brought, round for them again, on their finding themselves face to face, while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace, the same, odd impulse quietly to \\\"slope\\\"--so Adam Verver himself, as they, went, familiarly expressed it--that had acted, in its way, of, old; acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness, of their since so outlived crisis. It might have been funny to, them now that the presence of Mrs. Rance and the Lutches--and, with symptoms, too, at that time less developed--had once, for, their anxiety and their prudence, constituted a crisis; it might, have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured, to, their imagination, as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to, precipitate the need of a remedy. This amount of entertainment, and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their, actual impressions; they had been finding it, for months past, by, Maggie's view, a resource and a relief to talk, with an approach, to intensity, when they met, of all the people they weren't, really thinking of and didn't really care about, the people with, whom their existence had begun almost to swarm; and they closed, in at present round the spectres of their past, as they permitted, themselves to describe the three ladies, with a better imitation, of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve\\n\\ntaking them as they were; he might make some sign--she scarce, knew what--that would save her; save her from being the one, this, way, to pay all. He might somehow show a preference--, distinguishing between them; might, out of pity for her, signal, to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he, asked. That represented Maggie's one little lapse from, consistency--the sole small deflection in the whole course of her, scheme. It had come to nothing the next minute, for the dear, man's eyes had never moved, and Charlotte's hand, promptly passed, into her arm, had already, had very firmly drawn her on--quite\\n\\n\\\"Yes, as I say, it was while she was with me. But I didn't know, it. That is,\\\" said Fanny Assingham, \\\"I didn't know of anything in, particular.\\\" It sounded weak--that she felt; but she had really, her point to make. \\\"What I mean is that I don't know, for, knowledge, now, anything I didn't then. That's how I am.\\\" She, still, however, floundered. \\\"I mean it's how I WAS.\\\"\\n\\nwith no secret but her own. What occurred was simply that she, became aware, at a stroke, of the quantity of further nourishment, required by her own, and of the amount of it she might somehow, extract from these people; whereby she rose, of a sudden, to the, desire to possess and use them, even to the extent of braving, of, fairly defying, of directly exploiting, of possibly quite, enjoying, under cover of an evil duplicity, the felt element of, curiosity with which they regarded her. Once she was conscious of, the flitting wing of this last impression--the perception\\n\\nby remembering that the real \\\"relation\\\" between her father and, his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that, in, strictness, was none of her business; but she none the less, failed to keep quiet, as she would have called it, before the, projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation. Nothing, could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain, queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her, a wish that, usurped, perversely, the place of a much more natural one. If, Charlotte, while she was about it, could only have been WORSE!--, that idea Maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she, might desirably have been better. For, exceedingly odd as it was, to feel in such ways, she believed she mightn't have worried so, much if she didn't somehow make her stepmother out, under the, beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens, as lavish of, fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds, at least, of, gentleness. Gentleness and confidence were certainly the right, thing, as from a charming woman to her husband, but the fine, tissue of reassurance woven by this lady's hands and flung over, her companion as a light, muffling veil, formed precisely a, wrought transparency through which she felt her father's eyes, continually rest on herself. The reach of his gaze came to her, straighter from a distance; it showed him as still more, conscious, down there alone, of the suspected, the felt, elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him., She had herself now, for weeks and weeks, and all unwinkingly\\n\\nMaggie waited a little; she had for some time, now, kept her eyes, on him steadily; but they wandered, at this, to the fragments on, her chimney. \\\"Yes; it comes round, after all, to your having got, me the bowl. I myself was to come upon it, the other day, by so, wonderful a chance; was to find it in the same place and to have, it pressed upon me by the same little man, who does, as you say\\n\\nmore or less differently. Of that inevitability, of such other, ranges of response as were open to Charlotte, Maggie took the, measure in approaching her, on the morrow of her return from, Matcham, with the same show of desire to hear all her story. She, wanted the whole picture from her, as she had wanted it from her, companion, and, promptly, in Eaton Square, whither, without the, Prince, she repaired, almost ostentatiously, for the purpose\\n\\nThe assurance of his speech, she could note, quite held up its, head in him; his eyes met her own so, for the declaration, that, it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed, upon her, from afar off, out of his strange consistency. She kept, her direction still, however, under that. \\\"Oh, the thing I've, known best of all is that you've never wanted, together, to, offend us. You've wanted quite intensely not to, and the, precautions you've had to take for it have been for a long time, one of the strongest of my impressions. That, I think,\\\" she, added, \\\"is the way I've best known.\\\"\\n\\nof the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this, resource, the more it came back to her as the product of a, conscious art of dealing with her. He had been conscious, at the, moment, of many things--conscious even, not a little, of, desiring; and thereby of needing, to see what she would do in a, given case. The given case would be that of her being to a, certain extent, as she might fairly make it out, MENACED--, horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by, such a word. Why it was that to speak of making her stepmother, intervene, as they might call it, in a question that seemed, just, then and there, quite peculiarly their own business--why it was, that a turn so familiar and so easy should, at the worst, strike, her as charged with the spirit of a threat, was an oddity, disconnected, for her, temporarily, from its grounds, the, adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its, way. That, precisely, was doubtless why she had learned to wait\\n\\nsuccessions of pretty women, the theory of his fond interest in, whom had been publicly cultivated. It had never occurred to his, wife to pronounce him ingenuous, but there came at last a high, dim August dawn when she couldn't sleep and when, creeping, restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of, wooded acres, she found the faint flush of the east march with, the perception of that other almost equal prodigy. It rosily, coloured her vision that--even such as he was, yes--her husband, could on occasion sin by excess of candour. He wouldn't otherwise, have given as his reason for going up to Portland Place in the, August days that he was arranging books there. He had bought a, great many of late, and he had had others, a large number, sent, from Rome--wonders of old print in which her father had been, interested. But when her imagination tracked him to the dusty, town, to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds, where a, caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession, it wasn't, to see him, in his shirtsleeves, unpacking battered boxes.\\n\\n\\\"Then there you are.\\\" But Maggie had turned away, moving to the, window, as if still to keep something in her face from sight. She, stood there with her eyes on the street while Mrs. Assingham's, reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which, her condition, so oddly even to herself, was that both of, recurrent wonder and recurrent protest. She went over it, looked, at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her, hands. She laid them on it, lifting it up, and was surprised\\n\\nBut it was a question that took, not imperceptibly, some, answering. \\\"You've never affected me, from the first hour I, beheld you, as anything but--in a way all your own--absolutely, good and sweet and beautiful. In a way, as I say,\\\" Mrs. Assingham, almost caressingly repeated, \\\"just all your very own--nobody, else's at all. I've never thought of you but as OUTSIDE of ugly, things, so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as, never to have to be touched by them or to touch them. I've never, mixed you up with them; there would have been time enough for, that if they had seemed to be near you. But they haven't--if, that's what you want to know.\\\"\\n\\nthis made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she, perhaps might never be able to profit again. She was invoking, that reflection at the very moment he brought out, in reply to, her last words, a remark which, though perfectly relevant and, perfectly just, affected her at first as a high oddity. \\\"They're, doing the wisest thing, you know. For if they were ever to, go--!\\\" And he looked down at her over his cigar.\\n\\nfor the completeness of her image, Maggie was now supremely to, feel how every strain had been lightened for herself. So far as, SHE was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place; since, the work was done for her she felt no weight, and it wasn't too, much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round. She had a, long pause before the fire during which she might have been, fixing with intensity her projected vision, have been conscious, even of its taking an absurd, fantastic shape. She might have, been watching the family coach pass and noting that, somehow\\n\\nI had, before that, my idea--which you never dreamed I had. From, the moment I speak of it had more to go upon, and you became, yourselves, you and she, vaguely, yet uneasily, conscious of the, difference. But it's within these last hours that I've most seen, where we are; and as I've been in communication with Fanny, Assingham about my doubts, so I wanted to let her know my, certainty--with the determination of which, however, you must, understand, she has had nothing to do. She defends you,\\\" Maggie, remarked.\\n\\nfor these first minutes, face to face over their interval and, exchanging no sign; the intensity of their mutual look might have, pierced the night, and Maggie was at last to start with the, scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt, to dread, to, hesitation, for a time that, with no other proof needed, would, have completely given her away. How long had she stood staring?--, a single minute or five? Long enough, in any case, to have felt, herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the, latter threw upon her, irresistibly, by this effect of silence\\n\\nEven to that indeed, she could reflect, Charlotte might have, replied that it was easy to say; even to that no great meaning, could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw, hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving, his spell, weaving it off there by himself. In whatever quarter, of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed, as absorbed in this occupation; and Maggie was to become aware of, two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the, hint that he measured the impression he produced. It was not, really till after their recent long talk in the park that she, knew how deeply, how quite exhaustively, they had then, communicated--so that they were to remain together, for the time\\n\\nspringing up under her wrong and making them all start, stare and, turn pale, she might sound out their doom in a single sentence, a, sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid--after she had, faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness, she rose, from her place, laying aside her magazine, and moved slowly round, the room, passing near the card-players and pausing an instant, behind the chairs in turn. Silent and discreet, she bent a vague, mild face upon them, as if to signify that, little as she, followed their doings, she wished them well; and she took from, each, across the table, in the common solemnity, an upward, recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving, out to the terrace, a few minutes later. Her father and her, husband, Mrs. Assingham and Charlotte, had done nothing but meet, her eyes; yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a, separate passage--which was all the more wonderful since, with, the secret behind every face, they had alike tried to look at her, THROUGH it and in denial of it.\\n\\nwound her, they had signalled from house to house their clever, idea, the idea by which, for all these days, her own idea had, been profiting. They had built her in with their purpose--which, was why, above her, a vault seemed more heavily to arch; so that, she sat there, in the solid chamber of her helplessness, as in a, bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her, over the brim of, which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck., Baths of benevolence were very well, but, at least, unless one, were a patient of some sort, a nervous eccentric or a lost child\\n\\nand as consciously to herself, as she might have backed away from, the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip; a truth that, contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant, danger of advertising her subtle processes. That Charlotte should, have begun to be restrictive about the Assinghams--which she had, never, and for a hundred obviously good reasons, been before--, this in itself was a fact of the highest value for Maggie, and of, a value enhanced by the silence in which Fanny herself so much, too unmistakably dressed it. What gave it quite thrillingly its, price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to, her stepmother more actively--if she was to back up her friends, for holding out--than she had ever yet been opposed; though of, course with the involved result of the fine chance given Mrs., Verver to ask her husband for explanations. Ah, from the moment, she should be definitely CAUGHT in opposition there would be, naturally no saying how much Charlotte's opportunities might, multiply! What would become of her father, she hauntedly asked\\n\\nThese shadows rose and fell for her while Father Mitchell, prattled; with other shadows as well, those that hung over, Charlotte herself, those that marked her as a prey to equal, suspicions--to the idea, in particular, of a change, such a, change as she didn't dare to face, in the relations of the two, men. Or there were yet other possibilities, as it seemed to, Maggie; there were always too many, and all of them things of, evil when one's nerves had at last done for one all that nerves, could do; had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was, like the predicament of the night-watcher in a beast-haunted land, who has no more means for a fire. She might, with such nerves\\n\\nsomehow, the truth--for she was believing herself in relation to, the truth!--at which she mustn't so much as indirectly point., Such, at any rate, was the fashion in which her passionate, prudence played over possibilities of danger, reading symptoms, and betrayals into everything she looked at, and yet having to, make it evident, while she recognised them, that she didn't, wince. There were moments between them, in their chairs, when he, might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of, something new that would trip her up. There were pauses during, which, with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine, she, might yet, as at some hard game, over a table, for money, have, been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication, of consciousness. She was positively proud, afterwards, of the, great style in which she had kept this up; later on, at the, hour's end, when they had retraced their steps to find Amerigo, and Charlotte awaiting them at the house, she was able to say to, herself that, truly, she had put her plan through; even though, once more setting herself the difficult task of making their, relation, every minute of the time, not fall below the standard, of that other hour, in the treasured past, which hung there, behind them like a framed picture in a museum, a high watermark, for the history of their old fortune; the summer evening, in the, park at Fawns, when, side by side under the trees just as now\\n\\nFanny Assingham was there to explain away--of this she was duly, conscious; for that at least had been true up to now. In the, light, however, of Maggie's demonstration the quantity, even, without her taking as yet a more exact measure, might well seem, larger than ever. Besides which, with or without exactness, the, effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more, in presence of what Maggie herself saw. Maggie herself saw the, truth, and that was really, while they remained there together\\n\\nthis purpose only, she brought her repeatedly back to the, subject, both in her husband's presence and during several scraps, of independent colloquy. Before her father, instinctively, Maggie, took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not, less than her own--allowing, that is, for everything his wife, would already have had to tell him, for such passages, between, them, as might have occurred since the evening before. Joining, them after luncheon, reaching them, in her desire to proceed with, the application of her idea, before they had quitted the, breakfast-room, the scene of their mid-day meal, she referred, in, her parent's presence, to what she might have lost by delay, and, expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left, for her to pick up. Charlotte was dressed to go out, and her, husband, it appeared, rather positively prepared not to; he had, left the table, but was seated near the fire with two or three of, the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts, on a stand beside him--more even than the usual extravagance, as, Maggie's glance made out, of circulars, catalogues\\n\\nat the American Embassy, with another and a larger party; so that, the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the, younger, under date of six o'clock, a telegram requesting her, immediate attendance. \\\"Please come to me at once; dress early, if, necessary, so that we shall have time: the carriage, ordered for, us, will take you back first.\\\" Mrs. Assingham, on quick, deliberation, dressed, though not perhaps with full lucidity, and, by seven o'clock was in Portland Place, where her friend\\n\\nvirtually, by enabling every one present--and oh Charlotte not, least!--to draw a long breath. The message of the little scene, had been different for each, but it had been this, markedly, all, round, that it reinforced--reinforced even immensely--the general, effort, carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more, successful, to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were, the matter. Supremely, however, while this glass was held up to, her, had Maggie's sense turned to the quality of the success, constituted, on the spot, for Charlotte. Most of all, if she was, guessing how her father must have secretly started, how her, husband must have secretly wondered, how Fanny Assingham must, have secretly, in a flash, seen daylight for herself--most of all, had she tasted, by communication, of the high profit involved for, her companion. She FELT, in all her pulses, Charlotte feel it\\n\\nhowever, as Maggie approached, dropping her gaze to the latter's, level long enough to seem to adventure, marvellously, on a mute, appeal. \\\"You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this, there would be no knowing what she might do?\\\" This light Mrs., Assingham richly launched while her younger friend, unresistingly, moved, became uncertain again, and then, not too much to show, it--or, rather, positively to conceal it, and to conceal, something more as well--turned short round to one of the windows, and awkwardly, pointlessly waited. \\\"The largest of the three, pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands, looped round, it, which, as you see, are the finest possible vieux Saxe, are, not of the same origin or period, or even, wonderful as they are\\n\\nshe somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that, would improve upon her own. They were in short not only, themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity, but were, somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her, Maggie, as, well. And she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time, longer when, one afternoon in Portland Place, she broke out with, an irrelevance that was merely superficial.\\n\\nMoving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow, of a false position, she reflected that she should either not, have ceased to be right--that is, to be confident--or have, recognised that she was wrong; though she tried to deal with, herself, for a space, only as a silken-coated spaniel who has, scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears., Her shake of her head, again and again, as she went, was much of, that order, and she had the resource, to which, save for the rude, equivalent of his generalising bark, the spaniel would have been, a stranger, of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had, happened to her. She had not, so to speak, fallen in; she had had, no accident and had not got wet; this at any rate was her, pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she, mightn't, with or without exposure, have taken cold. She could at, all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited, and, certainly none--which was another special point--that so brought, with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement. This, birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime, in her view\\n\\nshould she follow him, would overtake or meet her there. She, followed him of necessity--it came, absolutely, so near to his, inviting her, by stepping off into temporary detachment, to give, the others something of the chance that she and her husband had, so fantastically discussed. Beside him then, while they hung over, the great dull place, clear and almost coloured now, coloured, with the odd, sad, pictured, \\\"old-fashioned\\\" look that empty, London streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer's end\\n\\nAnd she made a point even, our young woman, of not turning away., Her grip of her shawl had loosened--she had let it fall behind, her; but she stood there for anything more and till the weight, should be lifted. With which she saw soon enough what more was to, come. She saw it in Charlotte's face, and felt it make between, them, in the air, a chill that completed the coldness of their, conscious perjury. \\\"Will you kiss me on it then?\\\"\\n\\nBut she brooded and brooded. \\\"I'm not sure even that the Prince, will.\\\" It seemed privation, in short, for them all. \\\"They'll be, mystified, confounded, tormented. But they won't know--and all, their possible putting their heads together won't make them., That,\\\" said Fanny Assingham, \\\"will be their punishment.\\\" And she, ended, ever, when she had come so far, at the same pitch. \\\"It, will probably also--if I get off with so little--be mine.\\\"\\n\\nCharlotte's one opportunity, meanwhile, for the air of confidence, she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm, and charming type, was the presence of visitors, never, as the, season advanced, wholly intermitted--rather, in fact, so, constant, with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for, tea and to see the house, now replete, now famous, that, Maggie grew to think again of this large element of \\\"company\\\" as, of a kind of renewed water-supply for the tank in which, like a, party of panting gold-fish, they kept afloat. It helped them\\n\\nthrough whatever he might say, she was still adhering. \\\"It's not, my having gone into the place, at the end of four years, that, makes the strangeness of the coincidence; for don't such chances, as that, in London, easily occur? The strangeness,\\\" she lucidly, said, \\\"is in what my purchase was to represent to me after I had, got it home; which value came,\\\" she explained, \\\"from the wonder, of my having found such a friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She positively believes then they're guilty? She has arrived at, that, she's really content with it, in the absence of proof?\\\", It was here, each time, that Fanny Assingham most faltered; but, always at last to get the matter, for her own sense, and with a, long sigh, sufficiently straight. \\\"It isn't a question of belief, or of proof, absent or present; it's inevitably, with her, a, question of natural perception, of insurmountable feeling. She, irresistibly knows that there's something between them. But she, hasn't 'arrived' at it, as you say, at all; that's exactly what, she hasn't done, what she so steadily and intensely refuses to, do. She stands off and off, so as not to arrive; she keeps out to, sea and away from the rocks, and what she most wants of me is to, keep at a safe distance with her--as I, for my own skin, only ask, not to come nearer.\\\" After which, invariably, she let him have it, all. \\\"So far from wanting proof--which she must get, in a manner\\n\\nexceptionally intelligent lamb. The positive effect of the, intensity of this figure, however, was to make her shake it away, in her resumed descent; and after she had rejoined him, after she, had picked him up, she was to know the full pang of the thought, that her impossibility was MADE, absolutely, by his, consciousness, by the lucidity of his intention: this she felt, while she smiled there for him, again, all hypocritically; while, she drew on fair, fresh gloves; while she interrupted the process, first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to, make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into, his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity.\\n\\nwordless smile, but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted, silken rope, and Maggie's translation of it, held in her breast, till she got well away, came out only, as if it might have been, overheard, when some door was closed behind her. \\\"Yes, you see--I, lead her now by the neck, I lead her to her doom, and she doesn't, so much as know what it is, though she has a fear in her heart, which, if you had the chances to apply your ear there that I, as, a husband, have, you would hear thump and thump and thump. She, thinks it MAY be, her doom, the awful place over there--awful for, HER; but she's afraid to ask, don't you see? just as she's afraid, of not asking; just as she's afraid of so many other things that, she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals., She'll know, however--when she does know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes--to give us a life.\\\" Maggie had gone through the form of, recalling this, and the light of their ancient candour, shining, from so far back, had seemed to bring out some things so, strangely that, with the sharpness of the vision, she had risen, to her feet. \\\"Well, with a 'life' Fawns will certainly do.\\\" He, had remained in his place while she looked over his head; the, picture, in her vision, had suddenly swarmed. The vibration was, that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which, with her, companion, she was travelling; but she was having to steady, herself, this time, before meeting his eyes. She had measured, indeed the full difference between the move to Fawns because each, of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing-off, for a, journey, of her husband and her father, which nobody knew that, either wanted. \\\"More company\\\" at Fawns would be effectually, enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at, work; there was truly no question but that she and her father, must accept any array of visitors. No one could try to marry him, now. What he had just said was a direct plea for that, and what, was the plea itself but an act of submission to Charlotte? He, had, from his chair, been noting her look, but he had, the next, minute, also risen, and then it was they had reminded each other, of their having come out for the boy. Their junction with him and, with his companion successfully effected, the four had moved home, more slowly, and still more vaguely; yet with a vagueness that, permitted of Maggie's reverting an instant to the larger issue.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that's not for me to imagine, and I should be very sorry to, have to try to say! I'm aware of no point whatever at which I may, have failed you,\\\" said Charlotte; \\\"nor of any at which I may have, failed any one in whom I can suppose you sufficiently interested, to care. If I've been guilty of some fault I've committed it all, unconsciously, and am only anxious to hear from you honestly, about it. But if I've been mistaken as to what I speak of--the, difference, more and more marked, as I've thought, in all your, manner to me--why, obviously, so much the better. No form of, correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction.\\\"\\n\\nWith which, his glasses still fixed on her, his hands in his, pockets, his hat pushed back, his legs a little apart, he seemed, to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had, occurred to him he might as well treat her to, in default of, other things, before they changed their subject. It had the, effect, for her, of a reminder--a reminder of all he was, of all, he had done, of all, above and beyond his being her perfect, little father, she might take him as representing, take him as, having, quite eminently, in the eyes of two hemispheres, been, capable of, and as therefore wishing, not--was it?--, illegitimately, to call her attention to. The \\\"successful,\\\", beneficent person, the beautiful, bountiful, original\\n\\n\\\"it's only I to whom, fantastically, it says so much. That's all, I mean, at any rate--that it's sort of soothing; as if we were, sitting about on divans, with pigtails, smoking opium and seeing, visions. 'Let us then be up and doing'--what is it Longfellow, says? That seems sometimes to ring out; like the police breaking, in--into our opium den--to give us a shake. But the beauty of it, is, at the same time, that we ARE doing; we're doing, that is\\n\\nnone the less, what happened; inasmuch as if our young woman had, been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm, at a stroke, it yet took her but an instant to sound, at any, risk, the note she had been privately practising. If she had, practised it the day before, at dinner, on Amerigo, she knew but, the better how to begin for it with Mrs. Verver, and it immensely, helped her, for that matter, to be able at once to speak of the, Prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her, curiosity. Frankly and gaily she had come to ask--to ask what, in, their unusually prolonged campaign, the two had achieved. She had, got out of her husband, she admitted, what she could, but, husbands were never the persons who answered such questions, ideally. He had only made her more curious, and she had arrived, early, this way, in order to miss as little as possible of, Charlotte's story.\\n\\nIf Maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say, either, to her good friend or to any one else, more than she meant about, her father, she might have found herself betrayed into some such, overflow during the week spent in London with her husband after, the others had adjourned to Fawns for the summer. This was, because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so, simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident, in their course of life hitherto. She was used, herself\\n\\n\\\"And what in the world, my dear, did you mean by it?\\\"--that, sound, as at the touch of a spring, rang out as the first effect, of Fanny's speech. It broke upon the two women's absorption with, a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal, for the, door of the room had been opened by the Prince without their, taking heed. He had apparently had time, moreover, to catch the, conclusion of Fanny's act; his eyes attached themselves, through, the large space allowing just there, as happened, a free view, to, the shining fragments at this lady's feet. His question had been, addressed to his wife, but he moved his eyes immediately, afterwards to those of her visitor, whose own then held them in a, manner of which neither party had been capable, doubtless, for, mute penetration, since the hour spent by him in Cadogan Place on, the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of Charlotte's, reappearance. Something now again became possible for these, communicants, under the intensity of their pressure, something, that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of, pledges then exchanged. This rapid play of suppressed appeal and, disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results, than one--long enough for Mrs. Assingham to measure the feat of, quick self-recovery, possibly therefore of recognition still more, immediate, accompanying Amerigo's vision and estimate of the, evidence with which she had been--so admirably, she felt as she, looked at him--inspired to deal. She looked at him and looked at, him--there were so many things she wanted, on the spot, to say., But Maggie was looking too--and was moreover looking at them, both; so that these things, for the elder woman, quickly enough, reduced themselves to one. She met his question--not too late\\n\\nBut it made no difference, know as she might what a past--still, so recent and yet so distant--it alluded to; she repeated her, denial, warning him off, on her side, from spoiling the truth of, her contention. \\\"I never went into anything, and you see I don't;, I've continued to adore you--but what's that, from a decent, daughter to such a father? what but a question of convenient, arrangement, our having two houses, three houses, instead of one, (you would have arranged for fifty if I had wished!) and my, making it easy for you to see the child? You don't claim, I, suppose, that my natural course, once you had set up for, yourself, would have been to ship you back to American City?\\\"\\n\\nso dishonestly come by, for which her companion's still, countenance, at the hour and afterwards, had consented to serve, as the deep soil, might have worked up again to the surface, to, be thrown back upon her hands. Yes, it was positive that during, one of these minutes the Princess had the vision of her, particular alarm. \\\"It's her lie, it's her lie that has mortally, disagreed with her; she can keep down no longer her rebellion at, it, and she has come to retract it, to disown it and denounce, it--to give me full in my face the truth instead.\\\" This, for a, concentrated instant, Maggie felt her helplessly gasp--but only, to let it bring home the indignity, the pity of her state. She, herself could but tentatively hover, place in view the book she, carried, look as little dangerous, look as abjectly mild, as, possible; remind herself really of people she had read about in, stories of the wild west, people who threw up their hands, on, certain occasions, as a sign they weren't carrying revolvers. She, could almost have smiled at last, troubled as she yet knew, herself, to show how richly she was harmless; she held up her, volume, which was so weak a weapon, and while she continued, for, consideration, to keep her distance, she explained with as, quenched a quaver as possible. \\\"I saw you come out--saw you from, my window, and couldn't bear to think you should find yourself, here without the beginning of your book. THIS is the beginning;, you've got the wrong volume, and I've brought you out the right.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood with his hands in his pockets; he had carried his eyes, to the fragments on the chimney-piece, and she could already, distinguish the element of relief, absolutely of succour, in his, acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of, their friend's violence--every added inch of reflection and delay, having the advantage, from this point on, of counting for him, double. It had operated within her now to the last intensity, her, glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him, helping, him to help himself, as it were, she should help him to help HER., Hadn't she fairly got into his labyrinth with him?--wasn't she, indeed in the very act of placing herself there, for him, at its, centre and core, whence, on that definite orientation and by an, instinct all her own, she might securely guide him out of it? She, offered him thus, assuredly, a kind of support that was not to, have been imagined in advance, and that moreover required--ah, most truly!--some close looking at before it could be believed in, and pronounced void of treachery. \\\"Yes, look, look,\\\" she seemed, to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other--, \\\"look, look, both at the truth that still survives in that, smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that, I'm not such a fool as you supposed me. Look at the possibility, that, since I AM different, there may still be something in it, for you--if you're capable of working with me to get that out., Consider of course, as you must, the question of what you may, have to surrender, on your side, what price you may have to pay\\n\\n\\\"Oh, how can I talk,\\\" she asked, \\\"of otherwise? It ISN'T, luckily, for me, otherwise. If everything were different\\\"--she further, presented her thought--\\\"of course everything WOULD be.\\\" And then, again, as if that were but half: \\\"My idea is this, that when you, only love a little you're naturally not jealous--or are only, jealous also a little, so that it doesn't matter. But when you, love in a deeper and intenser way, then you are, in the same, proportion, jealous; your jealousy has intensity and, no doubt\\n\\nthe still further light that Charlotte, for herself, knew as, little as he had known. The vision loomed, in this light, it, fairly glared, for the few seconds--the vision of the two others, alone together at Fawns, and Charlotte, as one of them, having, gropingly to go on, always not knowing and not knowing! The, picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour--, that of the so possible identity of her father's motive and, principle with her own. HE was \\\"deep,\\\" as Amerigo called it, so, that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter;, just as she had earned that description by making and by, for, that matter, intending still to make, her care for his serenity\\n\\nduring which her impression rose and rose, even as that of the, typical charmed gazer, in the still museum, before the named and, dated object, the pride of the catalogue, that time has polished, and consecrated. Extraordinary, in particular, was the number of, the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing. He, was strong--that was the great thing. He was sure--sure for, himself, always, whatever his idea: the expression of that in him, had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste, for the rare and the true. But what stood out beyond everything, was that he was always, marvellously, young--which couldn't but, crown, at this juncture, his whole appeal to her imagination., Before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that, he was simply a great and deep and high little man, and that to, love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished, a whit\\n\\nno never, should she have to explain to Fanny Assingham again--, who, poor woman, on her own side, would be charged, it might be, forever, with that privilege of the higher ingenuity. She put it, all off on Fanny, and the dear thing herself might henceforth, appraise the quantity. More and more magnificent now in her, blameless egoism, Maggie asked no questions of her, and thus only, signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her. She, didn't care for what devotions, what dinners of their own the, Assinghams might have been \\\"booked\\\"; that was a detail, and she, could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to, which her service condemned them. It all fell in beautifully\\n\\nonce more pushed the door open, she had practically a sense of, method and experience. What she should never know about, Charlotte's thought--she tossed THAT in. It would find itself in, company, and she might at last have been standing there long, enough to see it fall into its corner. The sight moreover would, doubtless have made her stare, had her attention been more free--, the sight of the mass of vain things, congruous, incongruous\\n\\nat your hour, for blight, why was I myself dealt with all for, deception? why condemned after a couple of short years to find, the golden flame--oh, the golden flame!--a mere handful of black, ashes?\\\" Our young woman so yielded, at moments, to what was, insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity, that for, minutes together, sometimes, the weight of a new duty seemed to, rest upon her--the duty of speaking before separation should, constitute its chasm, of pleading for some benefit that might be, carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of, the emigre, the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and, negotiable some day in the market of misery.\\n\\nhad taken her into his arms. The hesitation had been at the, first, and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without, her help. She had given him no help; for if, on the one hand, she, couldn't speak for hesitation, so on the other--and especially as, he didn't ask her--she couldn't explain why she was agitated. She, had known it all the while down to her toes, known it in his, presence with fresh intensity, and if he had uttered but a, question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness., It had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to, him should have had that appearance; but she was more than ever, conscious that any appearance she had would come round, more or, less straight, to her father, whose life was now so quiet, on the, basis accepted for it, that any alteration of his consciousness, even in the possible sense of enlivenment, would make their, precious equilibrium waver. THAT was at the bottom of her mind\\n\\nher adversary in things of this fineness--to see him at all, in, short, brave a name that would represent him as in opposition--, was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering, of her cry of alarm. Should he guess they were having, in their, so occult manner, a HIGH fight, and that it was she, all the, while, in her supposed stupidity, who had made it high and was, keeping it high--in the event of his doing this before they could, leave town she should verily be lost.\\n\\nuninterruptedly presented until they moved again, might have, represented the success with which she watched all her message, penetrate. They presently went back the way she had come, but she, stopped Maggie again within range of the smoking-room window and, made her stand where the party at cards would be before her. Side, by side, for three minutes, they fixed this picture of quiet, harmonies, the positive charm of it and, as might have been said\\n\\nShe went to her room, through the quiet house; she roamed there a, moment, picking up, pointlessly, a different fan, and then took, her way to the shaded apartments in which, at this hour, the, Principino would be enjoying his nap. She passed through the, first empty room, the day nursery, and paused at an open door., The inner room, large, dim and cool, was equally calm; her boy's, ample, antique, historical, royal crib, consecrated, reputedly\\n\\nno doubt, from its never having troubled him in other connexions., She had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to, show for what it was. She had not been unconscious, on the other, hand, that if it hadn't touched Amerigo so nearly he would have, found in it matter for some amused reflection. He had uttered an, extraordinary sound, something between a laugh and a howl, on her, saying, as she had made a point of doing: \\\"Oh, most certainly, he, TOLD me his reason was because he 'liked' me\\\"--though she, remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been, provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those, that, so pictured, she had had to endure. That the partner of her, bargain had yearned to see her again, that he had plainly jumped, at a pretext for it, this also she had frankly expressed herself, to the Prince as having, in no snubbing, no scandalised, but, rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit, not, delayed to make out. He had wished, ever so seriously, to return, her a part of her money, and she had wholly declined to receive, it; and then he had uttered his hope that she had not, at all, events, already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose, she had, so kindly and so fortunately, named to him. It wasn't a, thing for a present to a person she was fond of, for she wouldn't, wish to give a present that would bring ill luck. That had come, to him--so that he couldn't rest, and he should feel better now, that he had told her. His having led her to act in ignorance was, what he should have been ashamed of; and, if she would pardon\\n\\nyou see, of my feeling myself wronged. Their least danger, they, know, is in going on with all the things that I've seemed to, accept and that I've given no indication, at any moment, of not, accepting. Everything that has come up for them has come up, in, an extraordinary manner, without my having by a sound or a sign, given myself away--so that it's all as wonderful as you may, conceive. They move at any rate among the dangers I speak of--, between that of their doing too much and that of their not having, any longer the confidence, or the nerve, or whatever you may call, it, to do enough.\\\" Her tone, by this time, might have shown a, strangeness to match her smile; which was still more marked as, she wound up. \\\"And that's how I make them do what I like!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wives, papa,\\\" she said; \\\"are always much better reporters--, though I grant,\\\" she added for Charlotte, \\\"that fathers are not, much better than husbands. He never,\\\" she smiled, \\\"tells me more, than a tenth of what you tell him; so I hope you haven't told him, everything yet, since in that case I shall probably have lost the, best part of it.\\\" Maggie went, she went--she felt herself going;, she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part, and rehearsing it, but who suddenly, on the stage, before the, footlights, had begun to improvise, to speak lines not in the, text. It was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that, kept her up, made her rise higher: just as it was the sense of, action that logically involved some platform--action quite, positively for the first time in her life, or, counting in the, previous afternoon, for the second. The platform remained for, three or four days thus sensibly under her feet, and she had all, the while, with it, the inspiration of quite remarkably, of quite, heroically improvising. Preparation and practice had come but a, short way; her part opened out, and she invented from moment to, moment what to say and to do. She had but one rule of art--to, keep within bounds and not lose her head; certainly she might see, for a week how far that would take her. She said to herself, in, her excitement, that it was perfectly simple: to bring about a, difference, touch by touch, without letting either of the three\\n\\nMrs. Assingham thought. \\\"The more danger then of his coming in, and finding me here. I don't know, you see, what you now consider, that you've ascertained; nor anything of the connexion with it of, that object that you declare so damning.\\\" Her eyes rested on this, odd acquisition and then quitted it, went back to it and again, turned from it: it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance\\n\\ncertainly, do nothing to make easy. She felt with her sharpest, thrill how he was straitened and tied, and with the miserable, pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could, none the less perfectly accord. To name her father, on any such, basis of anxiety, of compunction, would be to do the impossible, thing, to do neither more nor less than give Charlotte away., Visibly, palpably, traceably, he stood off from this, moved, back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived, but, which had been, between the two, with so much, so strangely much, else, quite uncalculated. Verily it towered before her, this, history of their confidence. They had built strong and piled, high--based as it was on such appearances--their conviction that\\n\\neverything, had restored them to the serenity of a relation, without a cloud. It had been, in short, in this light, ideally, conclusive, so that no ghost of anything it referred to could, ever walk again. What was the ecstasy of that, however, but in, itself a trifle compromising?--as truly, within the week, Maggie, had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning, and rather, abruptly, to remember. Convinced as she was of the example, already given her by her husband, and in relation to which her, profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity, exquisitely calculated, her imagination yet sought in the hidden, play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface\\n\\ndiffering always for a different interpreter. As she herself had, hovered in sight of it a quarter-of-an-hour before, it would have, been a thing for her to show Charlotte--to show in righteous, irony, in reproach too stern for anything but silence. But now it, was she who was being shown it, and shown it by Charlotte, and, she saw quickly enough that, as Charlotte showed it, so she must, at present submissively seem to take it.\\n\\nagain, to-night, after her start was taken; went, positively, as, she had felt herself going, three weeks before, on the morning, when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together, in the breakfast-room had been so determinant. In this other, scene it was Lady Castledean who was determinant, who kindled the, light, or at all events the heat, and who acted on the nerves;, Lady Castledean whom she knew she, so oddly, didn't like, in, spite of reasons upon reasons, the biggest diamonds on the, yellowest hair, the longest lashes on the prettiest, falsest, eyes, the oldest lace on the most violet velvet, the rightest, manner on the wrongest assumption. Her ladyship's assumption was, that she kept, at every moment of her life, every advantage--it, made her beautifully soft, very nearly generous; so she didn't, distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social, insects, often endowed with such a range, from the other, decorative spots on their bodies and wings. Maggie had liked, in, London, and in the world at large, so many more people than she, had thought it right to fear, right even to so much as judge\\n\\nBut she had her hours, thus, of feeling supremely linked to him, by the rigour of their law, and when it came over her that, all, the while, the wish, on his side, to spare her might be what most, worked with him, this very fact of their seeming to have nothing, \\\"inward\\\" really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of, sweetness that was wanting, as a consecration, even in her, yearning for her husband. She was powerless, however, was only, more utterly hushed, when the interrupting flash came, when she, would have been all ready to say to him, \\\"Yes, this is by every, appearance the best time we've had yet; but don't you see, all, the same, how they must be working together for it, and how my, very success, my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a, new basis, comes round to being their success, above all; their, cleverness, their amiability, their power to hold out, their, complete possession, in short, of our life?\\\" For how could she, say as much as that without saying a great deal more? without, saying \\\"They'll do everything in the world that suits us, save, only one thing--prescribe a line for us that will make them, separate.\\\" How could she so much as imagine herself even faintly, murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that, would have made her quail? \\\"Separate, my dear? Do you want them, to separate? Then you want US to--you and me? For how can the one, separation take place without the other?\\\" That was the question, that, in spirit, she had heard him ask--with its dread train\\n\\nfor the lingering moment, almost with a terror of her endless, power of surrender. He had only to press, really, for her to, yield inch by inch, and she fairly knew at present, while she, looked at him through her cloud, that the confession of this, precious secret sat there for him to pluck. The sensation, for, the few seconds, was extraordinary; her weakness, her desire, so, long as she was yet not saving herself, flowered in her face like, a light or a darkness. She sought for some word that would cover, this up; she reverted to the question of tea, speaking as if they, shouldn't meet sooner. \\\"Then about five. I count on you.\\\"\\n\\nHe faced her awhile longer in the same way; it was, strangely, as, if, by this sudden arrest, by their having, in their acceptance, of the unsaid, or at least their reference to it, practically, given up pretending--it was as if they were \\\"in\\\" for it, for, something they had been ineffably avoiding, but the dread of, which was itself, in a manner, a seduction, just as any, confession of the dread was by so much an allusion. Then she, seemed to see him let himself go. \\\"When a person's of the nature, you speak of there are always other persons to suffer. But you've, just been describing to me what you'd take, if you had once a, good chance, from your husband.\\\"\\n\\nAnd yet another of these concomitants of feverish success, all, the while, was the perception that in another quarter too things, were being made easy. Charlotte's alacrity in meeting her had, in, one sense, operated slightly overmuch as an intervention: it had, begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband's showing, her that, to be all there, as the phrase was, he likewise only, required--as one of the other phrases was too--the straight tip., She had heard him talk about the straight tip, in his moods of, amusement at English slang, in his remarkable displays of, assimilative power, power worthy of better causes and higher, inspirations; and he had taken it from her, at need, in a way, that, certainly in the first glow of relief, had made her brief, interval seem large. Then, however, immediately, and even though, superficially, there had declared itself a readjustment of, relations to which she was, once more, practically a little, sacrificed. \\\"I must do everything,\\\" she had said, \\\"without, letting papa see what I do--at least till it's done!\\\" but she, scarce knew how she proposed, even for the next few days, to, blind or beguile this participant in her life. What had in fact, promptly enough happened, she presently recognised, was that if, her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her, and if, she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her, husband's side, so, on the other hand, this had, with as little, delay, entailed some very charming assistance for her in Eaton, Square. When she went home with Charlotte, from whatever happy, demonstration, for the benefit of the world in which they, supposed themselves to live, that there was no smallest reason, why their closer association shouldn't be public and acclaimed--, at these times she regularly found that Amerigo had come either, to sit with his father-in-law in the absence of the ladies, or to, make, on his side, precisely some such display of the easy, working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of, her excursions with Charlotte. Under this particular impression, it was that everything in Maggie most melted and went to pieces--, every thing, that is, that belonged to her disposition to, challenge the perfection of their common state. It divided them, again, that was true, this particular turn of the tide--cut them, up afresh into pairs and parties; quite as if a sense for the, equilibrium was what, between them all, had most power of, insistence; quite as if Amerigo himself were all the while, at, bottom, equally thinking of it and watching it. But, as against, that, he was making her father not miss her, and he could have, rendered neither of them a more excellent service. He was acting, in short on a cue, the cue given him by observation; it had been, enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour; his, instinct for relations, the most exquisite conceivable, prompted, him immediately to meet and match the difference, to play somehow, into its hands. That was what it was, she renewedly felt, to have, married a man who was, sublimely, a gentleman; so that, in spite, of her not wanting to translate ALL their delicacies into the, grossness of discussion, she yet found again and again, in, Portland Place, moments for saying: \\\"If I didn't love you, you, know, for yourself, I should still love you for HIM.\\\" He looked, at her, after such speeches, as Charlotte looked, in Eaton, Square, when she called HER attention to his benevolence: through, the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her, extravagance, harmless though it might be, as a tendency to, reckon with. \\\"But my poor child,\\\" Charlotte might under this, pressure have been on the point of replying, \\\"that's the way nice, people ARE, all round--so that why should one be surprised about, it? We're all nice together--as why shouldn't we be? If we hadn't, been we wouldn't have gone far--and I consider that we've gone, very far indeed. Why should you 'take on' as if you weren't a, perfect dear yourself, capable of all the sweetest things?--as if, you hadn't in fact grown up in an atmosphere, the atmosphere of, all the good things that I recognised, even of old, as soon as I, came near you, and that you've allowed me now, between you, to, make so blessedly my own.\\\" Mrs. Verver might in fact have but, just failed to make another point, a point charmingly natural to, her as a grateful and irreproachable wife. \\\"It isn't a bit, wonderful, I may also remind you, that your husband should find\\n\\nAfter the little party was again constituted at Fawns--which had, taken, for completeness, some ten days--Maggie naturally felt, herself still more possessed, in spirit, of everything that had, last happened in London. There was a phrase that came back to her, from old American years: she was having, by that idiom, the time, of her life--she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of, possession, which was almost too violent either to recognise or, to hide. It was as if she had come out--that was her most general, consciousness; out of a dark tunnel, a dense wood, or even simply, a smoky room, and had thereby, at least, for going on, the, advantage of air in her lungs. It was as if she were somehow at, last gathering in the fruits of patience; she had either been, really more patient than she had known at the time, or had been, so for longer: the change brought about by itself as great a, difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a, telescope. It was her telescope in fact that had gained in, range--just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the, observation by the more charmed, and therefore the more reckless\\n\\nassented in secret despair, perhaps even in secret irritation, to, her being ridiculous?--so that the best now possible was to, wonder, once in a great while, whether one mightn't give her the, surprise of something a little less out of the true note than, usual. Something of this kind was the question that Maggie, while, the absentees still delayed, asked of the appearance she was, endeavouring to present; but with the result, repeatedly again\\n\\nHer friend took it, for a minute, however, by carrying thoughtful, eyes, eyes verily portentous, over her head. \\\"You say you've no, one to speak to, and you make a point of your having so disguised, your feelings--not having, as you call it, given yourself away., Have you then never seen it not only as your right, but as your, bounden duty, worked up to such a pitch, to speak to your, husband?\\\"\\n\\nand Maggie, as having known delusion--rather!--understood the, nature of cages. She walked round Charlotte's--cautiously and in, a very wide circle; and when, inevitably, they had to communicate, she felt herself, comparatively, outside, on the breast of, nature, and saw her companion's face as that of a prisoner, looking through bars. So it was that through bars, bars richly, gilt, but firmly, though discreetly, planted, Charlotte finally, struck her as making a grim attempt; from which, at first, the, Princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage, had suddenly been opened from within.\\n\\nIt provided for an evening--this had been Maggie's view; and she, lived up to her view, in her friend's eyes, by treating the, occasion, more or less explicitly, as new and strange. The good, Assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale, so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that, it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home, how, they met, themselves, the question of giving to eat. Maggie dined, with them, in short, and arrived at making her husband appear to, dine, much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have\\n\\nprecisely, to show what wonder she could work under pressure. Her, friend felt--how could she not?--as the truly pious priest might, feel when confronted, behind the altar, before the festa, with, his miraculous Madonna. Such an occasion would be grave, in, general, with all the gravity of what he might look for. But the, gravity to-night would be of the rarest; what he might look for, would depend so on what he could give.\\n\\ncontinue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve, glimmered, suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer, for, meeting her, a new basis and something like a new system., Maggie felt, truly, a rare contraction of the heart on making, out, the next instant, what the new system would probably have to, be--and she had practically done that before perceiving that the, thing she feared had already taken place. Charlotte, extending, her search, appeared now to define herself vaguely in the, distance; of this, after an instant, the Princess was sure\\n\\nafter all, she said to herself, was a renewal for him of the, privilege of watching that lady watch her. Very well, then: with, the elements after all so mixed in him, how long would he go on, enjoying mere spectatorship of that act? For she had by this time, made up her mind that in Charlotte's company he deferred to, Charlotte's easier art of mounting guard. Wouldn't he get tired--, to put it only at that--of seeing her always on the rampart\\n\\nto let her keep her head. She might have been losing her head, verily in her husband's eyes--since he didn't know, all the, while, that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted, intensity of her disposition personally to seize him. He didn't, know, either, that this was her manner--now she was with him--of, beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense. For the people, of the French Revolution, assuredly, there wasn't suspense; the, scaffold, for those she was thinking of, was certain--whereas, what Charlotte's telegram announced was, short of some, incalculable error, clear liberation. Just the point, however\\n\\nshe felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been, to them, how it would have torn them to pieces, if they had so, much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their, eyes. This danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be, reckoned with if the instinct of each--she could certainly at, least answer for her own--had not so successfully acted to trump, up other apparent connexions for it, connexions as to which they, could pretend to be frank.\\n\\npositively, moments of planned postponement, of evasion scarcely, less disguised than studied, during which she turned over with, anxiety the different ways--there being two or three possible, ones--in which her young stepmother might, at need, seek to work, upon her. Amerigo's not having \\\"told\\\" her of his passage with his, wife gave, for Maggie, altogether a new aspect to Charlotte's, consciousness and condition--an aspect with which, for, apprehension, for wonder, and even, at moments, inconsequently, enough, for something like compassion, the Princess had now to, reckon. She asked herself--for she was capable of that--what he, had MEANT by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a, matter touching her otherwise so nearly; what he had meant, that, is, for this unmistakably mystified personage herself. Maggie, could imagine what he had meant for her--all sorts of thinkable, things, whether things of mere \\\"form\\\" or things of sincerity\\n\\nHer best comprehension of Amerigo's success in not committing, himself was in her recall, meanwhile, of the inquiries he had, made of her on their only return to the subject, and which he had, in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make. He had, had it over with her again, the so distinctly remarkable incident, of her interview at home with the little Bloomsbury shopman. This, anecdote, for him, had, not altogether surprisingly, required, some straighter telling, and the Prince's attitude in presence of, it had represented once more his nearest approach to a, cross-examination. The difficulty in respect to the little man, had been for the question of his motive--his motive in writing\\n\\nthis snatched communion yet lifted Maggie as on air--so much, for, deep guesses on her own side too, it gave her to think of. There, was, honestly, an awful mixture in things, and it was not closed, to her aftersense of such passages--we have already indeed, in, other cases, seen it open--that the deepest depth of all, in a, perceived penalty, was that you couldn't be sure some of your, compunctions and contortions wouldn't show for ridiculous., Amerigo, that morning, for instance, had been as absent as he at, this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as, being; he had gone to London for the day and the night--a, necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more, than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests\\n\\nfiguratively speaking, and of prolongations of tension, round, about him, mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin, to virtue. Some day in some happier season, she would confess to, him that she hadn't confessed, though taking so much on her, conscience; but just now she was carrying in her weak, stiffened, hand a glass filled to the brim, as to which she had recorded a, vow that no drop should overflow. She feared the very breath of a, better wisdom, the jostle of the higher light, of heavenly help, itself; and, in addition, however that might be, she drew breath, this afternoon, as never yet, in an element heavy to oppression., Something grave had happened, somehow and somewhere, and she had\\n\\nand yet, from the moment one had thus appraised it, vivid and, definite in its domination of the scene. Fanny could no more, overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted, Christmas-tree; but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her, mind for some floating reminiscence of it. At the same time that, this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal, she even, not a little shared the Prince's mystic apprehension. The golden, bowl put on, under consideration, a sturdy, a conscious, perversity; as a \\\"document,\\\" somehow, it was ugly, though it, might have a decorative grace. \\\"His finding me here in presence, of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable--for all of us--than, you intend or than would necessarily help us. And I must take, time, truly, to understand what it means.\\\"\\n\\nthat their situation couldn't be bettered; and he even went at no, moment through the form of replying that, should their ordeal, strike her as exceeding their patience, any step they might take, would be for her own relief. This was, no doubt, partly because, he stood out so wonderfully, to the end, against admitting, by a, weak word at least, that any element of their existence WAS, or, ever had been, an ordeal; no trap of circumstance, no lapse of, \\\"form,\\\" no accident of irritation, had landed him in that, inconsequence. His wife might verily have suggested that he was, consequent--consequent with the admirable appearance he had from, the first so undertaken, and so continued, to present--rather too, rigidly at HER expense; only, as it happened, she was not the, little person to do anything of the sort, and the strange tacit, compact actually in operation between them might have been, founded on an intelligent comparison, a definite collation, positively, of the kinds of patience proper to each. She was, seeing him through--he had engaged to come out at the right end, if she WOULD see him: this understanding, tacitly renewed from, week to week, had fairly received, with the procession of the, weeks, the consecration of time; but it scarce needed to be, insisted on that she was seeing him on HIS terms, not all on, hers, or that, in other words, she must allow him his unexplained, and uncharted, his one practicably workable way. If that way, by, one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far, from having even yet completely fallen from him, happened, handsomely to show him as more bored than boring (with advantages, of his own freely to surrender, but none to be persuadedly, indebted to others for,) what did such a false face of the matter, represent but the fact itself that she was pledged? If she had, questioned or challenged or interfered--if she had reserved, herself that right--she wouldn't have been pledged; whereas there, were still, and evidently would be yet a while, long, tense, stretches during which their case might have been hanging, for, every eye, on her possible, her impossible defection. She must, keep it up to the last, mustn't absent herself for three minutes, from her post: only on those lines, assuredly, would she show, herself as with him and not against him.\\n\\nunder the action of Charlotte's presence, than the fact of a felt, sincerity in her words. She felt her sincerity absolutely sound--, she gave it for all it might mean. \\\"Because Charlotte, dear, you, know,\\\" she said, \\\"is incomparable.\\\" It took thirty seconds, but, she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one, of the happiest words of her life. They had turned from the view, of the street; they leaned together against the balcony rail\\n\\nunmistakably, had come up for her that had never come up before;, it represented a new complication and had begotten a new, anxiety--things, these, that she carried about with her done up, in the napkin of her lover's accepted rebuke, while she vainly, hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down. The, disguised solemnity, the prolonged futility of her search might, have been grotesque to a more ironic eye; but Maggie's provision, of irony, which we have taken for naturally small, had never been, so scant as now, and there were moments while she watched with, her, thus unseen, when the mere effect of being near her was to, feel her own heart in her throat, was to be almost moved to, saying to her: \\\"Hold on tight, my poor dear--without TOO MUCH, terror--and it will all come out somehow.\\\"\\n\\nthe least bit \\\"good,\\\" that he wouldn't already, long ago, in his, rummagings, have seen himself--and only not to think a quarter, good enough; this, however, was an old story, and one could not, have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the, individual gift, the friendship's offering, was, by a rigorous, law of nature, a foredoomed aberration, and that the more it was, so the more it showed, and the more one cherished it for showing\\n\\nhow friendly it had been. The infirmity of art was the candour of, affection, the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy;, the ugliest objects, in fact, as a general thing, were the, bravest, the tenderest mementos, and, as such, figured in glass, cases apart, worthy doubtless of the home, but not worthy of the, temple--dedicated to the grimacing, not to the clear-faced, gods., She herself, naturally, through the past years, had come to be, much represented in those receptacles; against the thick, locked, panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose, finding in, its place, each time, everything she had on successive, anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend, at her, suggestion, to be put off with, or at least think curious. She, was now ready to try it again: they had always, with his pleasure, in her pretence and her pleasure in his, with the funny betrayal, of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side, played the, game so happily. To this end, on her way home, she had loitered, everywhere; quite too deludedly among the old books and the old, prints, which had yielded nothing to her purpose, but with a, strange inconsequence in one of the other shops, that of a small, antiquarian, a queer little foreign man, who had shown her a, number of things, shown her finally something that, struck with, it as rather a rarity and thinking it would, compared to some of, her ventures, quite superlatively do, she had bought--bought, really, when it came to that, for a price. \\\"It appears now it, won't do at all,\\\" said Maggie, \\\"something has happened since that, puts it quite out of the question. I had only my day of, satisfaction in it, but I feel, at the same time, as I keep it, here before me, that I wouldn't have missed it for the world.\\\"\\n\\nand least of all her father, so much as suspect her hand. If they, should suspect they would want a reason, and the humiliating, truth was that she wasn't ready with a reason--not, that is, with, what she would have called a reasonable one. She thought of, herself, instinctively, beautifully, as having dealt, all her, life, at her father's side and by his example, only in reasonable, reasons; and what she would really have been most ashamed of, would be to produce for HIM, in this line, some inferior, substitute. Unless she were in a position to plead, definitely\\n\\nfor her minute, wittingly exposed; but she saw it as quickly, cease to threaten--quite saw the Princess, even though in all her, pain, refuse, in the interest of their strange and exalted, bargain, to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the, stab of reproach, the opportunity thus coming all of itself. She, saw her--or she believed she saw her--look at her chance for, straight denunciation, look at it and then pass it by; and she, felt herself, with this fact, hushed well-nigh to awe at the, lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that, no discovery--since it was, however obscurely, a case of, \\\"discovery\\\"--could make less needful. These seconds were brief--, they rapidly passed; but they lasted long enough to renew our, friend's sense of her own extraordinary undertaking, the function, again imposed on her, the answerability again drilled into her\\n\\nsurprisingly, to be connected; conviction, that is, budged no, inch, only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil--but, action began to hover like some lighter and larger, but easier, form, excited by its very power to keep above ground. It would be, free, it would be independent, it would go in--wouldn't it?--for, some prodigious and superior adventure of its own. What would, condemn it, so to speak, to the responsibility of freedom--this, glimmered on Maggie even now--was the possibility, richer with, every lapsing moment, that her husband would have, on the whole, question, a new need of her, a need which was in fact being born, between them in these very seconds. It struck her truly as so new, that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all;, would indeed, absolutely, by this circumstance, be REALLY needing, her for the first one in their whole connection. No, he had used, her, had even exceedingly enjoyed her, before this; but there had, been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him, which she was rapidly taking on. The immense advantage of this, particular clue, moreover, was that she should have now to, arrange, alter, to falsify nothing; should have to be but, consistently simple and straight. She asked herself, with, concentration, while her back was still presented, what would be, the very ideal of that method; after which, the next instant, it, had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the, application. \\\"Fanny Assingham broke it--knowing it had a crack, and that it would go if she used sufficient force. She thought\\n\\nmy dear, if you come to that, is the matter with YOU?\\\" When, a, minute later on, he had followed up his last note by a touch or, two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the, anomalous, at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to, the question. \\\"There seems a kind of charm, doesn't there? on our, life--and quite as if, just lately, it had got itself somehow, renewed, had waked up refreshed. A kind of wicked selfish, prosperity perhaps, as if we had grabbed everything, fixed, everything, down to the last lovely object for the last glass, case of the last corner, left over, of my old show. That's the, only take-off, that it has made us perhaps lazy, a wee bit, languid--lying like gods together, all careless of mankind.\\\"\\n\\nAmerigo, meanwhile, after all, could clearly make the most of her, having enjoined on him to wait--suggested it by the positive pomp, of her dealings with the smashed cup; to wait, that is, till she, should pronounce as Mrs. Assingham had promised for her. This, delay, again, certainly tested her presence of mind--though that, strain was not what presently made her speak. Keep her eyes, for, the time, from her husband's as she might, she soon found herself, much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit. There, was even a minute, when her back was turned to him, during which, she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him, a, strangeness that had already, fifty times, brushed her, in the, depth of her trouble, as with the wild wing of some bird of the, air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft, of a well, darkening there by his momentary flutter the far-off, round of sky. It was extraordinary, this quality in the taste of, her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to, soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more, she had to recognise it; for what it came to was that seeing, herself finally sure, knowing everything, having the fact, in all, its abomination, so utterly before her that there was nothing, else to add--what it came to was that, merely by being WITH him, there in silence, she felt, within her, the sudden split between, conviction and action. They had begun to cease, on the spot\\n\\nThey went in to receive the boy, upon whose introduction to the, room by Miss Bogle Charlotte and the Prince got up--seemingly, with an impressiveness that had caused Miss Bogle not to give, further effect to her own entrance. She had retired, but the, Principino's presence, by itself, sufficiently broke the, tension--the subsidence of which, in the great room, ten minutes, later, gave to the air something of the quality produced by the, cessation of a sustained rattle. Stillness, when the Prince and, Princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage\\n\\nA few days of this, accordingly, had wrought a change in that, apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph--of triumph, magnanimous and serene--with which the upshot of the night-scene, on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms. She, had had, as we know, her vision of the gilt bars bent, of the, door of the cage forced open from within and the creature, imprisoned roaming at large--a movement, on the creature's part\\n\\nin all probability, primarily, to conjure away any such, appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his, father-in-law might notice and follow up. It would have been open, to him however, given the pitch of their intimacy, to avert this, danger by some more conceivable course with Charlotte; since an, earnest warning, in fact, the full freedom of alarm, that of his, insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred, and on the, importance accordingly of outward peace at any price, would have, been the course really most conceivable. Instead of warning and, advising he had reassured and deceived her; so that our young, woman, who had been, from far back, by the habit, if her nature\\n\\nreduced to looking vaguely about at the sky, could only feel her, not fail of her purpose. \\\"The air's heavy as if with thunder--I, think there'll be a storm.\\\" She made the suggestion to carry off, an awkwardness--which was a part, always, of her companion's, gain; but the awkwardness didn't diminish in the silence that, followed. Charlotte had said nothing in reply; her brow was dark, as with a fixed expression, and her high elegance, her handsome, head and long, straight neck testified, through the dusk, to, their inveterate completeness and noble erectness. It was as if, what she had come out to do had already begun, and when, as a, consequence, Maggie had said helplessly, \\\"Don't you want, something? won't you have my shawl?\\\" everything might have, crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute. Mrs., Verver's rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they, hadn't closed in for idle words, just as her dim, serious face\\n\\nthe quantity of change in their state. Well then, that other, sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble;, with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward, refreshment. They HAD, after all, whatever happened, always and, ever each other; each other--that was the hidden treasure and the, saving truth--to do exactly what they would with: a provision, full of possibilities. Who could tell, as yet, what, thanks to, it, they wouldn't have done before the end?\\n\\nher appreciation of his taste, her native passion for beautiful, objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could, teach her about them. Maggie had in due course seen her begin, to \\\"work\\\" this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it, was worth. She took possession of the mound throughout its, extent; she abounded, to odd excess, one might have remarked, in, the assumption of its being for her, with her husband, ALL the, ground, the finest, clearest air and most breathable medium, common to them. It had been given to Maggie to wonder if she, didn't, in these intensities of approbation, too much shut him up, to his province; but this was a complaint he had never made his, daughter, and Charlotte must at least have had for her that\\n\\nshe could talk so of their \\\"time\\\"--she was somehow sustained; she, was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present, possession of her ground. \\\"They have their reasons--many things, to think of; how can one tell? But there's always, also, the, chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours, together; I mean that he and I shall. He may wish to take me off, to dine with him somewhere alone--and to do it in memory of old, days. I mean,\\\" the Princess went on, \\\"the real old days; before, my grand husband was invented and, much more, before his grand, wife was: the wonderful times of his first great interest in what, he has since done, his first great plans and opportunities\\n\\nLeft with her husband, Maggie, however, for the time, said, nothing; she only felt, on the spot, a strong, sharp wish not to, see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange, it. She had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her, next movement--seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise, that followed his entrance. Then it was that she knew how hugely, expert she had been made, for judging it quickly, by that vision, of it, indelibly registered for reference, that had flashed a, light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from, Matcham. The expression worn by it at that juncture, for however, few instants, had given her a sense of its possibilities, one of, the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her\\n\\nCharlotte had brought this out with the richness, almost, of, gaiety;  and Maggie, to go on, had to think, with her own, intensity, of Amerigo--to think how he, on his side, had had to, go through with his lie to her, how it was for his wife he had, done so, and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her, the example. He must have had his own difficulty about it, and, she was not, after all, falling below him. It was in fact as if\\n\\nfrom catching at him as, in the other time, with the superficial, impetus he and Charlotte had privately conspired to impart, she, had so often, her breath failing her, known the impulse to catch, at her father? She did, however, just yet, nothing inconsequent--, though she couldn't immediately have said what saved her; and by, the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing, something merely needful. \\\"I wanted you simply to know--so that, you mayn't by accident miss them. For it's the last,\\\" said, Maggie.\\n\\nThe sharp, successful, almost primitive wail in it made Charlotte, turn, and this movement attested for the Princess the felicity of, her deceit. Something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the, night she stood in the drawing-room and denied that she had, suffered. She was ready to lie again if her companion would but, give her the opening. Then she should know she had done all., Charlotte looked at her hard, as if to compare her face with her, note of resentment; and Maggie, feeling this, met it with the, signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of, defeat. \\\"I want really to possess him,\\\" said Mrs. Verver. \\\"I, happen also to feel that he's worth it.\\\"\\n\\nprecisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the, thing born out of sight. The ingenuity was thus a private and, absorbing exercise, in the light of which, might I so far, multiply my metaphors, I should compare her to the frightened but, clinging young mother of an unlawful child. The idea that had, possession of her would be, by our new analogy, the proof of her, misadventure, but likewise, all the while, only another sign of a, relation that was more to her than anything on earth. She had, lived long enough to make out for herself that any deep-seated, passion has its pangs as well as its joys, and that we are made, by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it. She, had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to, her husband; but to become aware, almost suddenly, that it had, begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a, strain would, rightly looked at, after all but show that she was\\n\\nThe point of view--that one--was what she read in their free, contemplation, in that of the whole eight; there was something in, Amerigo to be explained, and she was passed about, all tenderly, and expertly, like a dressed doll held, in the right manner, by, its firmly-stuffed middle, for the account she could give. She, might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach; she, might have been expected to articulate, with a rare imitation of, nature, \\\"Oh yes, I'm HERE all the while; I'm also in my way a, solid little fact and I cost originally a great deal of money:, cost, that is, my father, for my outfit, and let in my husband, for an amount of pains--toward my training--that money would, scarce represent.\\\" Well, she WOULD meet them in some such way\\n\\nfrom the other house to their own, when he had tried to charm, her, by his sovereign personal power, into some collapse that, would commit her to a repudiation of consistency. She was never, alone with him, it was to be said, without her having sooner or, later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency;, yet, at the same time, so long as she breathed no charge, she, kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from, attack. Attack, real attack, from him, as he would conduct it, was what she above all dreaded; she was so far from sure that, under that experience she mightn't drop into some depth of, weakness, mightn't show him some shortest way with her that he, would know how to use again. Therefore, since she had given him\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" Maggie went on while the footman came back to let them, out. \\\"I see,\\\" she said again; though she felt a little, disconcerted. What she really saw, of a sudden, was that her, stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the, proposal, and this brought her back her need that her father, shouldn't think her concerned in any degree for anything. She, alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat; her, husband, to let her out, had passed before her, and, a little in, advance, he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace, a step, high, that preceded their open entrance, on either side of which, one of their servants stood. The sense of a life tremendously, ordered and fixed rose before her, and there was something in, Amerigo's very face, while his eyes again met her own through the, dusky lamplight, that was like a conscious reminder of it. He, had answered her, just before, distinctly, and it appeared to, leave her nothing to say. It was almost as if, having planned for, the last word, she saw him himself enjoying it. It was almost as, if--in the strangest way in the world--he were paying her back\\n\\n\\\"The consciousness\\\"--she had never lost her promptness--\\\"of, having no stones to throw at any one else's windows. She has, enough to do to guard her own glass. That was what she was, doing,\\\" Fanny said, \\\"that last morning at Matcham when all of us, went off and she kept the Prince and Charlotte over. She helped, them simply that she might herself be helped--if it wasn't, perhaps, rather, with her ridiculous Mr. Blint, that HE might be., They put in together, therefore, of course, that day; they got it, clear--and quite under her eyes; inasmuch as they didn't become, traceable again, as we know, till late in the evening.\\\" On this, historic circumstance Mrs. Assingham was always ready afresh to, brood; but she was no less ready, after her brooding, devoutly to, add \\\"Only we know nothing whatever else--for which all our stars, be thanked!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but naturally!\\\" On which, as the warranted truth of it hung, in the air--the truth warranted, as who should say, exactly by, the present opportunity to pronounce, this opportunity created, and accepted--she found herself lost, though with a finer thrill, than she had perhaps yet known, in the vision of all he might, mean. The sense of it in her rose higher, rose with each moment, that he invited her thus to see him linger; and when, after a, little more, he had said, smoking again and looking up, with head, thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail, at the grey\\n\\nto dispense so unwontedly--as their life had recently come to be, arranged--with his wife's attendance. It had so happened that she, herself was, for the hour, exempt from her husband's, and it will, at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when I, note that, remembering how the Prince had looked in to say he was, going out, the Princess whimsically wondered if their respective, sposi mightn't frankly be meeting, whimsically hoped indeed they, were temporarily so disposed of. Strange was her need, at, moments, to think of them as not attaching an excessive, importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had, rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness., Repudiations, surely, were not in the air--they had none of them, come to that; for wasn't she at this minute testifying directly, against them by her own behaviour? When she should confess to, fear of being alone with her father, to fear of what he might, then--ah, with such a slow, painful motion as she had a horror, of!--say to her, THEN would be time enough for Amerigo and, Charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather.\\n\\nIt now appeared, none the less, that some renewed conversation, with Mr. Crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly, and, Maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own, to, the success of which she designed to devote her morning. Visits, of gracious ladies, under his protection, lighted up rosily, for, this perhaps most flower-loving and honey-sipping member of the, great Bloomsbury hive, its packed passages and cells; and though, not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found, herself, according to her appeal to him, yearning again, nothing, was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding, urbanities. So it had been settled, Maggie said to Mrs., Assingham, and she was to dispense with Amerigo's company. Fanny, was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last, fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman's detachment\\n\\nmagnificently handsome and supremely distinguished--they might, have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was, the author; they might even, for the happy appearance they, continued to present, have been such figures as would, by the, strong note of character in each, fill any author with the, certitude of success, especially of their own histrionic. They, might in short have represented any mystery they would; the point, being predominantly that the key to the mystery, the key that, could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring, was there, in her pocket--or rather, no doubt, clasped at this crisis in her, hand and pressed, as she walked back and forth, to her breast., She walked to the end and far out of the light; she returned and, saw the others still where she had left them; she passed round, the house and looked into the drawing-room, lighted also, but, empty now, and seeming to speak the more, in its own voice, of, all the possibilities she controlled. Spacious and splendid, like, a stage again awaiting a drama, it was a scene she might people\\n\\nfor herself, so suddenly and violently received. She had done her, best, even while taking it full in the face, not to give herself, away; but she wouldn't answer--no, she wouldn't--for what she, might, in her agitation, have made her informant think. He might, think what he would--there had been three or four minutes during, which, while she asked him question upon question, she had, doubtless too little cared. And he had spoken, for his, remembrance, as fully as she could have wished; he had spoken\\n\\nthe rages of jealousy, the protests of passion, as for something, she had been cheated of not least: a range of feelings which for, many women would have meant so much, but which for HER husband's, wife, for HER father's daughter, figured nothing nearer to, experience than a wild eastern caravan, looming into view with, crude colours in the sun, fierce pipes in the air, high spears, against the sky, all a thrill, a natural joy to mingle with, but, turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other, defiles. She saw at all events why horror itself had almost, failed her; the horror that, foreshadowed in advance, would, by, her thought, have made everything that was unaccustomed in her, cry out with pain; the horror of finding evil seated, all at its, ease, where she had only dreamed of good; the horror of the thing, HIDEOUSLY behind, behind so much trusted, so much pretended\\n\\nwhich was arranged. Her thought, over this, arrived at a great, intensity--had indeed its pauses and timidities, but always to, take afterwards a further and lighter spring. The ground was, well-nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and, his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of, movement. Policy or no policy, it was they themselves who were, arranged. She must be kept in position so as not to DISarrange, them. It fitted immensely together, the whole thing, as soon as, she could give them a motive; for, strangely as it had by this, time begun to appear to herself, she had hitherto not imagined, them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her, own. Of course they were arranged--all four arranged; but what, had the basis of their life been, precisely, but that they were, arranged together? Amerigo and Charlotte were arranged together\\n\\nprecisely, in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the, conditions of the simpler time, into a queer resemblance between, the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless, other moments that were sufficiently far away. She had been quick, in her preparation, in spite of the flow of the tide that, sometimes took away her breath; but a pause, once more, was still, left for her to make, a pause, at the top of the stairs, before, she came down to him, in the span of which she asked herself if, it weren't thinkable, from the perfectly practical point of view\\n\\nwhile they were alone, before she had rung for a servant, he had, renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity, such as, it was, on which she had ventured. They had risen together to, come upstairs; he had been talking at the last about some of the, people, at the very last of all about Lady Castledean and Mr., Blint; after which she had once more broken ground on the matter, of the \\\"type\\\" of Gloucester. It brought her, as he came round the, table to join her, yet another of his kind conscious stares, one, of the looks, visibly beguiled, but at the same time not, invisibly puzzled, with which he had already shown his sense of, this charming grace of her curiosity. It was as if he might for a, moment be going to say:--\\\"You needn't PRETEND, dearest, quite so, hard, needn't think it necessary to care quite so much!\\\"--it was, as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence\\n\\nthat their equilibrium was everything, and that it was, practically precarious, a matter of a hair's breadth for the loss, of the balance. It was the equilibrium, or at all events her, conscious fear about it, that had brought her heart into her, mouth; and the same fear was, on either side, in the silent look, she and Amerigo had exchanged. The happy balance that demanded, this amount of consideration was truly thus, as by its own, confession, a delicate matter; but that her husband had also HIS, habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them, after, all, more closely together. It would have been most beautifully\",\n          \"How the remainder of that Jacksonian ticket was elected, down to the very, hog-reeves, and amid what turmoil of the Democracy and bitterness of, spirit of the orthodox, I need not recount. There is no moral to the, story, alas--it was one of those things which inscrutable heaven, permitted to be done. After that dark town-meeting day some of those, stern old fathers became broken men, and it is said in Coniston that this, calamity to righteous government, and not the storm, gave to Priest Ware, his death-stroke.\\n\\nA week passed, and Jethro did not appear in the village, report having it, that he was cutting his farms on Thousand Acre Hill. When Jethro was, farming,--so it was said,--he would not stop to talk politics even with, the President of the United States were that dignitary to lean over his, pasture fence and beckon to him. On a sultry Friday morning, when William, Wetherell was seated at Jonah Winch's desk in the cool recesses of the, store slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome accounts which, seemed hopeless, he was thrown into a panic by the sight of one staring, at him from the far side of a counter. History sometimes reverses itself.\\n\\nMassachusetts, deals in all kinds of seeds? Ellett--that's it. Wrote to, Ellet, said I had a hundred bushels of Red Brooks to sell, as fine a, lookin' potato as I had in my cellar. Made up my mind to take what he, offered, if it was only five cents. He wrote back a dollar a bushel. I-I, was always satisfied with my Red Brook Seedlings, Sam. But I never raised, any more--n-never raised any more.\\\"\\n\\nThe notes are mine, not Moses's. Strange that they didn't occur to Moses., What a wealthy man has our hero become at thirty-one! Jethro Bass was, rich beyond the dreams of avarice--for Coniston. Truth compels me to, admit that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine, thousand \\\"dollars\\\"; but that was a large sum of money for Coniston in, those days, and even now. Nathan Bass had been a saving man, and had left, to his son one-half of this fortune. If thrift and the ability to gain, wealth be qualities for a hero, Jethro had them--in those days.\\n\\nEven as Isaac D. Worthington did not dream of the Truro Railroad and of, an era in the haze of futurity, it did not occur to Jethro Bass that his, ambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand. Makers of, eras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate matters to, worry about history. Jethro never heard the expression about \\\"cracks in, the Constitution,\\\" and would not have known what it meant,--he merely had, the desire to get on top. But with Established Church Coniston tight in, the saddle (in the person of Moses Hatch, Senior), how was he to do it?\\n\\nTo return to the book. As long as he lived, Jethro looked back to the joy, of the monumental task of mastering its contents. In his mind, Napoleon, became a rough Yankee general; of the cities, villages, and fortress he, formed as accurate a picture as a resident of Venice from Marco Polo's, account of Tartary. Jethro had learned to read, after a fashion, to, write, add, multiply, and divide. He knew that George Washington and, certain barefooted companions had forced a proud Britain to her knees\\n\\nWith these words of brotherly advice Mr. Bass went off down the road, and, Mr. Price chopped no more wood that night; but repeated to himself many, times in his nasal voice, \\\"I want to know!\\\" In the course of the next few, weeks various gentlemen mentioned to Mr. Price that he had been spoken of, for Moderator, and he became acquainted with the names of the other, candidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned. Whereupon he, girded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of Jacksonian, Democracy in all the farmhouses roundabout, with such effect that Samuel, Todd and others were able to talk with some fluency about the rights of, American citizens.\\n\\nIsaac Worthington came to Coniston not once, but many times, before the, snow fell; and afterward, too, in Silas Wheelock's yellow sleigh through, the great drifts under the pines, the chestnut Morgan trotting to one, side in the tracks. On one of these excursions he fell in with that, singular character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first, visit, in coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens. Jethro Bass was plodding, in the same direction, and Isaac Worthington, out of the goodness of his, heart, invited him into the sleigh. He was scarcely prepared for the, bumpkin's curt refusal, but put it down to native boorishness, and, thought no more about it then.\\n\\nAt noon, on one of those madcap April days of that Coniston country, Jock, descended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly figure of, Jethro Bass coming toward him across the green. Jethro was about thirty, years of age, and he wore a coonskin cap even in those days, and trousers, tacked into his boots. He carried his big head bent forward, a little to, one aide, and was not, at first sight, a prepossessing-looking person. As, our story largely concerns him and we must get started somehow, it may as, well be to fix a little attention on him.\\n\\n\\\"Jock, you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church,\\\", said Cynthia, as she walked away. The young Moses referred to was Moses, Hatch, Junior, son of the pillar of the Church and State, and it was an, open secret that he was madly in love with Cynthia. Let it be said of him, that he was a steady-going young man, and that he sighed for the moon.\\n\\nBut so it came to pass, she was taken from him, who had been the one joy, and inspiration of his weary days, and he was driven, wandering, into, unfrequented streets that he might not recall, the places where she had, once trod, and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted him,--its, laughter, its sweet notes of seriousness; little ways and manners of her, look came to twist his heart, and he prayed God to take him, too, until, it seemed that Cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness. One mild Sunday, afternoon, he took little Cynthia by the hand and led her, toddling, out, into the sunny Common, where he used to walk with her mother, and the, infant prattle seemed to bring--at last a strange peace to his, storm-tossed soul.\\n\\nand she walked out under the maples of the village street. Let it be, understood that Coniston was a village, by courtesy, and its shaded road, a street. Suddenly, there was the tannery, Jethro standing in front of, it, contemplative. Did he see her? Would he come to her? Cynthia, seized, by a panic of shame, flew into Aunt Lucy Prescott's, sat through half an, hour of torture while Aunt Lucy talked of redemption of sinners, during, ten minutes of which Jethro stood, still contemplative. What tumult was, in his breast, or whether there was any tumult, Cynthia knew not. He went, into the tannery again, and though she saw him twice later in the week\\n\\nJake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road, and pointed to the low, gable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the, meeting-house. The visitor gave a short glance at it, swung around and, gave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction., He did not suspect that Jake was what is now called a news agency. Then, Mr. Worthington turned to Jethro, who was stooping over the bark.\\n\\nCuriosity as a factor has never, perhaps, been given its proper weight by, philosophers. Besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal, as an, instigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men and, women, and made and marred careers. And curiosity now laid hold of, Cynthia Ware. Why in the world she should ever have been curious about, Jethro Bass is a mystery to many, for the two of them were as far apart, as the poles. Cynthia, of all people, took to watching the tanner's son\\n\\nLyman did it; not, perhaps, without cursing and grumbling. Lyman was a, profane and wicked man--drover, farmer, trader, anything. He had a cider, mill on his farm on the south slopes of Coniston which Mr. Ware had, mentioned in his sermons, and which was the resort of the ungodly. The, cider was not so good as Squire Northcutt's, but cheaper. Jethro was not, afraid of Lyman, and he had a mortgage on the six-horse team, and on the, farm and the cider mill.\\n\\nJethro was content to wait. That is a clew to his character throughout, his life. He would wait for his love, he would wait for his hate: he had, waited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little, scheme which he had been gradually developing during that time, for which, he had been amassing money, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, by the, way, had given him some valuable ideas. Jethro, as well as Isaac D., Worthington, had ambitions, although no one in Coniston had hitherto, guessed them except Jock Hallowell--and Cynthia Ware, after her curiosity, had been aroused.\\n\\nThat journey to Coniston was full of wonder to Cynthia, and of wonder and, sadness to Wetherell, for it was the way his other Cynthia had come to, Boston. From the state capital the railroad followed the same deep valley, as the old coach road, but ended at Truro, and then they took stage over, Truro Pass for Brampton, where honest Ephraim awaited them and their, slender luggage with a team. Brampton, with its wide-shadowed green, and, terrace-steepled church; home once of the Social Library and Lucretia, Penniman, now famous; home now of Isaac Dudley Worthington, whose great, mills the stage driver had pointed out to them on Coniston Water as they, entered the town.\\n\\nWe shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more, those, stanch old deacons and selectmen, who did their duty by their, fellow-citizens as they saw it and took no man's bidding. They could not, see the trackless roads over the hills, now becoming tracked, and the, bent figures driving doggedly against the storm, each impelled by a, motive: each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become, imperative. Some, like Eben Williams behind his rickety horse, came, through fear; others through ambition; others were actuated by both; and, still others were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater, jealousy and envy, and the remembrance of those who had been in power. I, must not omit the conscientious Jacksonians who were misguided enough to, believe in such a ticket.\\n\\nLet us call, next, Mr. Eben Williams, if we can. Moses Hatch, Senior, has, already interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the, church, for Mr. Williams is orthodox, though the deacons have to remind, him of his duty once in a while. Eben is timid, and replies to us, as to, Moses, that he has heard of the Democratic ticket, and callates that, Fletcher Bartlett, who has always been the leader of the Democratic, party, has named the ticket. He did not mention Jethro Bass to Deacon, Hatch. Why should he? What has Jethro Bass got to do with politics?\\n\\n\\\"Then he will go,\\\" said Cynthia, so quietly that he gave her another, look, strange and tender and comprehending. He, sat and talked of many, things: of the great war that was agonizing the nation; of the strong man, who, harassed and suffering himself, was striving to guide it, likening, Lincoln unto a physician. So the doctor was wont to take the minds of, patients from themselves. And before he left he gave poor Wetherell a, fortnight to decide.\\n\\nThere was a young man in Boston, when Jethro arrived in Lyman Hull's, team, named William Wetherell. By extraordinary circumstances he and, another connected with him are to take no small part in this story, which, is a sufficient excuse for his introduction. His father had been a, prosperous Portsmouth merchant in the West India trade, a man of many, attainments, who had failed and died of a broken heart; and William, at, two and twenty, was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of Mr. Judson in, Cornhill.\\n\\nJethro Bass--Eben testifies to us--is in the habit of visiting him once a, month, perhaps, when he goes to Amos Cuthbert's. Just friendly calls. Is, it not a fact that Jethro Bass holds his mortgage? Yes, for eight hundred, dollars. How long has he held that mortgage? About a year and a half. Has, the interest been paid promptly? Well, the fact is that Eben hasn't paid, any interest yet.\\n\\nIn spite of herself, Cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in, the builder's voice. Now that she thought of it, there was rugged power, in Jethro's face, especially when he took off the coonskin cap. She, always nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the, road, and sometimes he nodded back, but oftener he had not appeared to, see her. She had thought this failure to nod stupidity, but it might, after all be abstraction.\\n\\nI am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of, fiction,--this is a true chronicle, and they stayed apart most of that, winter. Jethro went about his daily tasks, which were now become, manifold, and he wore the locket on its little chain himself. He did not, think that Cynthia loved him--yet, but he had the effrontery to believe, that she might, some day; and he was content to wait. He saw that she, avoided him, and he was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur, ridicule and contempt.\\n\\nCynthia kept her eyes on her plate, but she felt as though her body were, afire. Little did the minister imagine, as he went off to write his, sermon, that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery., Yes, Cynthia guessed; and she could not read that evening because of the, tumult of her thoughts. What was her duty in the matter? To tell her, father her suspicions? They were only suspicions, after all, and she, could make no accusations. And Jethro! Although she condemned him, there, was something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible, sense of humor. Cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice, and knew, that it was wicked. She excused Jethro, and told herself that, with his, lack of training, he could know no better. Then an idea came to her, and, the very boldness of it made her grow hot again. She would appeal to him, tell him that that power he had over other men could be put to better and, finer uses. She would appeal to him, and he would abandon the matter., That the man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she was sure\\n\\nYoung Mr. Worthington, instead of being justly indignant, laughed and, settled himself comfortably on a pile of bark. He thought Jethro a, character, and he was not mistaken. On the other hand, Mr. Worthington, displayed a knowledge of the falling-mill and splitting-machine and the, process of tanneries in general that was surprising. Jethro, had Mr., Worthington but known it, was more interested in animate machines: more, interested in Mr. Worthington than the falling-mill or, indeed, the, tannery business.\\n\\nAt last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of Coniston itself., There was the flagpole and the triangular green, scene of many a muster;, Jonah Winch's store, with its horse block and checker-paned windows, just, as Jonah had left it; Nathan Bass's tannery shed, now weather-stained and, neglected, for Jethro lived on Thousand Acre Hill now; the Prescott, house, home of the Stark hero, where Ephraim lived, \\\"innocent of paint\\\", (as one of Coniston's sons has put it), \\\"innocent of paint as a Coniston, maiden's face\\\"; the white meeting-house, where Priest Ware had, preached--and the parsonage. Cynthia and Wetherell loitered in front of, it, while the blue shadow of the mountain deepened into night, until Mr., Satterlee, the minister, found them there, and they went in and stood, reverently in the little chamber on the right of the door, which had been, Cynthia's.\\n\\nTo this day the railroad has not reached Coniston Village--nay, nor, Coniston Flat, four miles nearer Brampton. The village lies on its own, little shelf under the forest-clad slope of the mountain, and in the, midst of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used to, drill on June days. At one end of the triangle is the great pine mast, that graced no frigate of George's, but flew the stars and stripes on, many a liberty day. Across the road is Jonah Winch's store, with a, platform so high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it;, with its checker-paned windows, with its dark interior smelling of coffee, and apples and molasses, yes, and of Endea rum--for this was before the, days of the revivals.\\n\\nThree mornings later, a little after seven o'clock, when the storekeeper, and his small daughter were preparing to go to Brampton upon a very, troublesome errand, Chester Perkins appeared again. It is always easy to, stir up dissatisfaction among the ne'er-do-wells (Jethro had once done it, himself), and during the three days which had elapsed since Chester had, flung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright treason, heard in the store. William Wetherell, who had perplexities of his own\\n\\nThe hills seem to leap up against the sky as I describe that region where, Cynthia Ware was born, and the very old country names help to summon up, the picture. Coniston Mountain, called by some the Blue Mountain, clad in, Hercynian forests, ten good miles in length, north and south, with its, notch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers of it. Coniston, Water, that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred places, on the, eastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite\\n\\nThe next day is Sunday, and there is mild excitement in Coniston. For, Jethro Bass, still with the coonskin cap, but in a brass-buttoned coat, secretly purchased in Brampton, appeared at meeting! It made no, difference that he entered quietly, and sat in the rear slip, orthodox, Coniston knew that he was behind them: good Mr. Ware knew it, and changed, a little his prayers and sermon: Cynthia knew it, grew hot and cold by, turns under her poke bonnet. Was he not her brand, and would she not get, the credit of snatching him? How willingly, then, would she have given up, that credit to the many who coveted it--if it were a credit. Was Jethro, at meeting for any religious purpose?\\n\\nLet us pursue this matter a little farther, and form a committee of, investigation. Where did Mr. Todd learn anything about Jacksonian, principles? From Mr. Samuel Price, whom they have spoken of for, Moderator. And where did Mr. Price learn of these principles? Any one in, Coniston will tell you that Mr. Price makes a specialty of orators and, oratory; and will hold forth at the drop of a hat in Jonah Winch's store, or anywhere else. Who is Mr. Price? He is a tall, sallow young man of, eight and twenty, with a wedge-shaped face, a bachelor and a Methodist\\n\\nwho now drove the Brampton stage, brought the goods to the door. Little, Rias Richardson was willing to come in, and help move the barrels, and on, such occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes. William still had, time for his books; in that Coniston air he began to feel stronger, and, to wonder whether he might not be a Washington Irving yet. And yet he had, one worry and one fear, and both of these concerned one man,--Jethro, Bass. Him, by her own confession, Cynthia Ware had loved to her dying, day, hating herself for it: and he, William Wetherell, had married this, woman whom Jethro had loved so violently, and must always love--so, Wetherell thought: that was the worry. How would Jethro treat him? that, was the fear. William Wetherell was not the most courageous man in the, world.\\n\\nAnother Saturday came, and no Cynthia went to Brampton. Jethro may or may, not have been on the road. Sunday, and there was Jethro on the back seat, in the meetinghouse: Sunday noon, over his frugal dinner, the minister, mildly remonstrates with Cynthia for neglecting one who has shown signs, of grace, citing certain failures of others of his congregation: Cynthia, turns scarlet, leaving the minister puzzled and a little uneasy: Monday\\n\\nBefore he went to bed Jake Wheeler had written a letter which he sent off, to the state capital by the stage the next morning. In it he indicted no, less than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and he also thought, it wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby, a lieutenant in that, section, to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his well-known, methods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic. Such was, Jake's ordinary procedure when the bombs were fired, for Mr. Wheeler was, nothing if not cautious.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Listy, they call her. Nobody ever knew how he come to marry her., Jethro went up to Wisdom once, in the centre of the state, and come back, with her. Funny place to bring a wife from--Wisdom! Funnier place to, bring Listy from. He loads her down with them ribbons and gewgaws--all, the shades of the rainbow! Says he wants her to be the best-dressed woman, in the state. Callate she is,\\\" added Moses, with conviction. \\\"Listy's a, fine woman, but all she knows is enough to say, 'Yes, Jethro,' and 'No\\n\\npointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies, which she had, made herself. Impelled by a strange curiosity, William Wetherell went to, the door and watched them. There was a look on the face of Jethro Bass, that was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the wondrous, things around them that summer's day,--the flowers and the bees and the, brook (they must go down and stand on the brink of it), and the songs of, the vireo and the hermit thrush.\\n\\nHe caught her, struggling wildly, terror-stricken, in his arms, beat down, her hands, flung back her hood, and kissed her forehead--her hair, blown, by the wind--her lips. In that moment she felt the mystery of heaven and, hell, of all kinds of power. In that moment she was like a seed flying in, the storm above the mountain spruces whither, she knew not, cared not., There was one thought that drifted across the chaos like a blue light of, the spirit: Could she control the storm? Could she say whither the winds, might blow, where the seed might be planted? Then she found herself, listening, struggling no longer, for he held her powerless. Strangest of, all, most hopeful of all, his own mind was working, though his soul, rocked with passion.\\n\\nJethro Bass had not been in Coniston since William's arrival. No need to, ask where he was. Jake Wheeler, Jethro's lieutenant in Coniston, gave, William a glowing account of that Throne Room in the Pelican Hotel at the, capital, from whence Jethro ruled the state during the sessions of the, General Court. This legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory, committee of three hundred and fifty: an expensive advisory committee to, the people, relic of an obsolete form of government. Many stories of the, now all-powerful Jethro William heard from the little coterie which made, their headquarters in his store--stories of how those methods of which we, have read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties. Not, that Jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties, but the local, lieutenants did, and bowed to him as an overlord. There were funny, stories, and grim stories of vengeance which William Wetherell heard and, trembled at. Might not Jethro wish to take vengeance upon him?\\n\\nHow those checker-paned windows bring back the picture of that village, green! The meeting-house has them, lantern-like, wide and high, in three, sashes--white meeting-house, seat alike of government and religion, with, its terraced steeple, with its classic porches north and south. Behind it, is the long shed, and in front, rising out of the milkweed and the, flowering thistle, the horse block of the first meeting-house, where many, a pillion has left its burden in times bygone. Honest Jock Hallowell, built that second meeting-house--was, indeed, still building it at the, time of which we write. He had hewn every beam and king post in it, and, set every plate and slip. And Jock Hallowell is the man who, unwittingly, starts this chronicle.\\n\\nAs for Cynthia, nothing was farther from her mind. Unchristian as was the, thought, if this thing she had awakened could only have been put back to, sleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would she have, been happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than, sincerity, he received the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days, she welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston\\n\\nFor many years these Sunday walks in the Common were Wetherell's greatest, pleasure and solace, and it seemed as though little Cynthia had come into, the world with an instinct, as it were, of her mission that lent to her, infant words a sweet gravity and weight. Many people used to stop and, speak to the child, among them a great physician whom they grew to know., He was, there every Sunday, and at length it came to be a habit with him, to sit down on the bench and take Cynthia on his knee, and his stern face, would soften as he talked to her.\\n\\nIn front of the minister's barn under the elms on the hill Cynthia pulled, the harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened activity, of mind. She was not one who shrank from self-knowledge, and the question, put itself to her, \\\"Whither was this matter tending?\\\" The fire that is in, strong men has ever been a lure to women; and many, meaning to play with, it, have been burnt thereby since the world began. But to turn the fire., to some use, to make the world better for it or stranger for it, that, were an achievement indeed! The horse munching his hay, Cynthia lingered, as the light fainted above the ridge, with the thought that this might be, woman's province, and Miss Lucretia Penniman might go on leading her, women regiments to no avail. Nevertheless she was angry with Jethro, not, because of what he had said, but because of what he was.\\n\\nCynthia stared at him, perhaps with a new interest at this plodding, determination. She was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking to, him a third time in these woods, especially if the subject of, conversation were not, as Coniston thought, the salvation of his soul., But she stayed. Here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known, rules, who did not even deign to notice a week of marked coldness.\\n\\nHe sat behind a table covered with green leather, on which papers were, laid with elaborate neatness, and he wore a double-breasted skirted coat, of black, with braided lapels, a dark purple blanket cravat with a large, red cameo pin. And Mr. Worthington's features harmonized perfectly with, this costume--those of a successful, ambitious man who followed custom, and convention blindly; clean-shaven, save for reddish chops, blue eyes, of extreme keenness, and thin-upped mouth which had been tightening year, by year as the output of the Worthington Minx increased.\\n\\nSergeant Ephraim had much to say about the great war, and about Coniston., True to the instincts of the blood of the Stark hero, he had left the, plough and the furrow' at the first call, forty years of age though he, was. But it had been otherwise with many in Coniston and Brampton and, Harwich. Some of these, when the drafting came, had fled in bands to the, mountain and defied capture. Mr. Dudley Worthington, now a mill owner\\n\\nMay came, and the pools dried up, the orchards were pink and white, the, birches and the maples were all yellow-green on the mountain sides, against the dark pines, and Cynthia was driving the minister's gig to, Brampton. Ahead of her, in the canon made by the road between the great, woods, strode an uncouth but powerful figure--coonskin cap, homespun, breeches tucked into boots, and all. The gig slowed down, and Cynthia, began to tremble with that same delightful fear. She knew it must be, wicked, because she liked it so much. Unaccountable thing! She felt all, akin to the nature about her, and her blood was coursing as the sap, rushes through a tree. She would not speak to him; of that she was sure\\n\\nOne evening, the summer after their marriage, they were walking in the, Mall under the great elms that border the Common on the Tremont Street, side. They often used to wander there, talking of the books he was to, write when strength should come and a little leisure, and sometimes their, glances would linger longingly on Colonnade Row that Bulfinch built, across the way, where dwelt the rich and powerful of the city--and yet he, would not have exchanged their lot for his. Could he have earned with his, own hands such a house, and sit Cynthia there in glory, what happiness!, But, I stray.\\n\\n\\\"H-how much for that?\\\" he said, pointing to another. The clerk told him., He inquired about them all, deliberately repeating the sums, considering, with so well-feigned an air of a purchaser that Mr. Wetherell began to, take a real joy in the situation. For trade was slack in August, and, diversion scarce. Finally he commanded that the case be put on the top of, the counter, and Wetherell humored him. Whereupon he picked up the locket, he had first chosen. It looked very delicate in his huge, rough hand, and, Wetherell was surprised that the eyes of Mr. Bass had been caught by the, most expensive, for it was far from being the showiest.\\n\\nWetherell choked. The man outside shook the door again, and people on the, sidewalk stopped, and presently against the window panes a sea of curious, faces gazed in upon them. Mr. Bass's thoughts apparently were fixed on, Eternity--he looked neither at the people nor at Wetherell. And then, the, crowd parting as for one in authority, as in a bad dream the clerk saw, his employer, Mr. Judson, courteously pushing away the customer at the, door who would not be denied. Another moment, and Mr. Judson had gained, admittance with his private key, and stood on the threshold staring at, clerk and customer. Jethro gave no sign that the situation had changed.\\n\\nHe did not speak, but dropped his hands to his sides. His thoughts were, not to be fathomed, yet Cynthia took the movement for silent, confession,--which it was not, and stood appalled at the very magnitude, of his accomplishment, astonished at the secrecy he had maintained. She, had heard that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house of, Moses Hatch as having taken part in the matter, and she guessed something, of certain of his methods. But she had felt his force, and knew that this, was not the only secret of his power.\\n\\nBy all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing., They sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step, and, there discussed Cynthia's tastes. She was too old for dolls, Jethro, supposed. Yes, Cynthia was too old for dolls. She did not say so, but the, only doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of such, a reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon her., Books, suggested Jethro. Books she had known from her earliest infancy:, they had been piled around that bedroom over the roof. Books and book, lore and the command of the English tongue were William Wetherell's only, legacies to his daughter, and many an evening that spring she had read, him to sleep from classic volumes of prose and poetry I hesitate to name\\n\\n\\\"Great!\\\" Ephraim ejaculated. \\\"Guess he's the biggest man in the state, to-day. Queer how he got his power began twenty-four years ago when I, wahn't but twenty. I call that town meetin' to mind as if 'twas yesterday, never was such an upset. Jethro's be'n first Selectman ever sense, though, he turned Republican in '60. Old folks don't fancy Jethro's kind of, politics much, but times change. Jethro saved my life, I guess.\\\"\\n\\nThe summer flew on apace, for Coniston. Fragrant hay was cut on hillsides, won from rock and forest, and Coniston Water sang a gentler melody--save, when the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain and the rain, beat on the shingles. During the still days before the turn of the, year,--days of bending fruit boughs, crab-apples glistening red in the, soft sunlight,--rumor came from Brampton to wrinkle the forehead of Moses, Hatch as he worked among his father's orchards.\\n\\nThe sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day. Jethro's barn, and tannery were full, and many other barns in the village. And now the, peace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past. Deacon Lysander, Richardson, the moderator, sits aghast in his high place as they come, trooping in, men who have not been to town meeting for ten years. Deacon, Lysander, with his white band of whiskers that goes around his neck like, a sixteenth-century ruff under his chin, will soon be a memory. Now, enters one, if Deacon Lysander had known it symbolic of the new Era. One, who, though his large head is bent, towers over most of the men who make, way for him in the aisle, nodding but not speaking, and takes his place, in the chair under the platform on the right of the meeting-pause under, one of the high, three-part windows. That chair was always his in future, years, and there he sat afterward, silent, apparently taking no part. But, not a man dropped a ballot into the box whom Jethro Bass did not see and, mark.\\n\\nOne evening a fortnight later, while the lieutenant was holding forth in, commendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless if, not wholly admiring audience, a bomb burst in their midst. William, Wetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb, like those flung at, regular intervals from the Union mortars into Vicksburg. These bombs, at, any rate, never failed to cause consternation and fright in Coniston\\n\\nThe sun had dropped behind the mountain, leaving Coniston in amethystine, shadow, and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in, front of Aunt Lucy Prescott's window, before Cynthia returned. Aunt Lucy, was Cynthia's grandmother, and eighty-nine years of age. Still she sat in, her window beside the lilac bush, lost in memories of a stout, rosy lass, who had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the wilderness, some seventy years agone in Indian days--Weathersfield Massacre days., That lass was Aunt Lucy herself, and in just such a May had Timothy's axe, rung through the Coniston forest and reared the log cabin, where six of, her children were born. Likewise in review passed the lonely months when, Timothy was fighting behind his rugged General Stark for that privilege, more desirable to his kind than life--self government. Timothy Prescott, would pull the forelock to no man, would have such God-fearing persons as, he chose make his laws for him.\\n\\nPriest Ware ended a life of faithful service. The high pulpit, taken from, the old meeting house, and the cricket on which he used to stand and the, Bible from which he used to preach have remained objects of veneration in, Coniston to this day. A fortnight later many tearful faces gazed after, the Truro coach as it galloped out of Brampton in a cloud of dust, and, one there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill, who saw, within it a girl dressed in black, dry-eyed, staring from the window.\\n\\nThere is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than Brampton Street on, a summer's day. Down the length of it runs a wide green, shaded by, spreading trees, and on either side, tree-shaded, too, and each in its, own little plot, gabled houses of that simple, graceful architecture of, our forefathers. Some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices, the, envy of many a modern architect, and fan-shaped windows in dormer and, doorway. And there was the church, then new, that still stands to the, glory of its builders; with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the, widest of checker-paned sashes to let in the light on high-backed pews, and gallery.\\n\\nAs he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly, to solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country, a, visitor was climbing the last steep flight of stairs. That visitor was, none other than Sergeant Ephraim Prescott, son of Isaiah of the, pitch-pipe, and own cousin of Cynthia Ware's. Sergeant Ephraim was just, home from the war and still clad in blue, and he walked with a slight, limp by reason of a bullet he had got in the Wilderness, and he had such, an honest, genial face that little Cynthia was on his knee in a moment.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose the humblest of God's critturs has their uses,\\\" Moses remarked, contemplatively, as he watched the retreating figures of Sam and Jake., \\\"Leastwise that's Jethro's philosophy. When you come to know him, you'll, notice how much those fellers walk like him. Never seed a man who had so, many imitators. Some of,'em's took to talkie' like him, even to, stutterin'. Bijah Bixby, over to Clovelly, comes pretty nigh it, too.\\\"\\n\\nand much of the warring in the book took color from Captain Timothy, Prescott's stories of General Stark and his campaigns, heard at Jonah, Winch's store. What Paris looked like, or Berlin, or the Hospice of St., Bernard--though imaged by a winter Coniston--troubled Jethro not at all;, the thing that stuck in his mind was that Napoleon--for a considerable, time, at least--compelled men to do his bidding. Constitutions crumble, before the Strong. Not that Jethro philosophized about constitutions., Existing conditions presented themselves, and it occurred to him that, there were crevices in the town system, and ways into power through the, crevices for men clever enough to find them.\\n\\nNo wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the, honored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the perquisite of the church in, Coniston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered, it as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom, there were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that, morning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away, the breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated, for town office. Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on, the steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the sky., He had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely making, five out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass had for, some years been journeying through the town, baying his hides and wool\\n\\nFor some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard, the query ringing, in his head: Why had Jethro Bass bought that note? Did he think that the, storekeeper at Coniston would be of use to him, politically? The words, Chester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as he, stood in the door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no money, to pay even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed Cynthia\\n\\nwhen Jonah Winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner, Deacon, Lysander raps for order and the minister prays. They proceed, first, to, elect a representative to the General Court. The Jacksonians do not, contest that seat,--this year,--and Isaiah Prescott, fourteenth child of, Timothy, the Stark hero, father of a young Ephraim whom we shall hear, from later, is elected. And now! Now for a sensation, now for disorder, and misrule!\\n\\nThe cry is taken up all over the meeting-house, and rises high above the, hiss of the sleet on the great windows. Somebody's got on the stove, to, add to the confusion and horror. The only man in the whole place who is, not excited is Jethro Bass himself, who sits in his chair regardless of, those pressing around him. Many years afterward he confessed to some one, that he was surprised--and this is true. Fletcher Bartlett had surprised, and tricked him, but was forgiven. Forty men are howling at the, moderator, who is pounding on the table with a blacksmith's blows. Squire, Asa Northcutt, with his arms fanning like a windmill from the edge of the, platform, at length shouts down everybody else--down to a hum. Some, listen to him: hear the words \\\"infamous outrage\\\"--\\\"if Jethro Bass is, elected Selectman, Coniston will never be able to hold up her head among, her sister towns for very shame.\\\" (Momentary blank, for somebody has got, on the stove again, a scuffle going on there.) \\\"I see it all now,\\\" says, the Squire--(marvel of perspicacity!) \\\"Jethro Bass has debased and, debauched this town--\\\" (blank again, and the squire points a finger of, rage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair) \\\"he has bought and, intimidated men to do his bidding. He has sinned against heaven, and, against the spirit of that most immortal of documents--\\\" (Blank again., Most unfortunate blank, for this is becoming oratory, but somebody from, below has seized the squire by the leg.) Squire Northcutt is too, dignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble, but he did, get his leg liberated and kicked Fletcher Bartlett in the face. Oh\\n\\nAt last, by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties, something, like order is restored, the ballots are in the box, and Deacon Lysander, is counting them: not like another moderator I have heard of, who spilled, the votes on the floor until his own man was elected. No. Had they, registered his own death sentence, the deacon would have counted them, straight, and needed no town clerk to verify his figures. But when he, came to pronounce the vote, shame and sorrow and mortification overcame, him. Coniston, his native town, which he had served and revered, was, dishonored, and it was for him, Lysander Richardson, to proclaim her, disgrace. The deacon choked, and tears of bitterness stood in his eyes\\n\\nShe darted swiftly past him, seizing the door and drawing it closed after, her. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face., Her own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with a shame that, was insupportable. Now that she was there, beside him, her strength, failed her, and her courage--courage that she had been storing for this, dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day. Now that she, was there, she would have given her life to have been able to retrace her, steps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the mountain.\\n\\n\\\"The only one of importance,\\\" he answered. \\\"This week, when I went to, Coniston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and, a most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I tried to get, him to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen., Suddenly he turned on me and asked me if I was 'callatin' to set up a, mill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters, in Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?\\\"\\n\\nNo one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who are, willing to risk their necks and their horses' legs for the sake of, scenery. The tough little Morgans of that time, which kept their feet, like cats, have all but disappeared, but there were places on that road, where Lyman Hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a, stretch. He was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom, to enjoy the beauties of such a trip, and nearly everybody in Coniston, was afraid of him. Jethro Bass would sit silent on the seat for hours, and--it is a fact to be noted that when he told Lyman to do a thing\\n\\n\\\"It is perhaps an open secret,\\\" continued Mr. Worthington, \\\"that in the, near future I intend to establish a free library in Brampton. I feel it, my duty to do all I can for the town where I have made my success, and, there is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good, library.\\\" Whereupon he shot at Wetherell another of his keen looks. \\\"I do, not talk this way ordinarily to my customers, Mr. Wetherell,\\\" he began;, \\\"but you interest me, and I am going to tell you something in confidence., I am sure it will not be betrayed.\\\"\\n\\nworking side by side, sharing this strange secret between them. And after, that night Cynthia talked to him often of Coniston, until he came to know, the mountain that lay along the western sky, and the sweet hillsides by, Coniston Water under the blue haze of autumn, aye, and clothed in the, colors of spring, the bright blossoms of thorn and apple against the, tender green of the woods and fields. So he grew to love the simple, people there, but little did he foresee that he was to end his life among, them!\\n\\nThey sat in the summer twilight, until darkness fell, and the lights, gleamed through the leaves, and a deep, cool breath coming up from the, sea stirred the leaves above their heads. That she should have loved, Jethro seemed as strange to her as to him, and yet Wetherell was to feel, the irresistible force of him. Hers was not a love that she chose, or, would have chosen, but something elemental that cried out from the man to, her, and drew her. Something that had in it now, as of yore, much of pain, and even terror, but drew her. Strangest of all was that William, Wetherell understood and was not jealous of this thing: which leads us to, believe that some essence of virility was lacking in him, some substance, that makes the fighters and conquerors in this world. In such mood he, listened to the story of Jethro Bass.\\n\\n\\\"We have been compelled to see what was weak in democracy as well as,    what was strong. We have begun obscurely to recognize that things,    do not go of themselves, and that popular government is not in,    itself a panacea, is no better than any other form except as the,    virtue and wisdom of the people make it so, and that when men,    undertake to do their own kingship, they enter upon, the dangers and,    responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function. Above,    all, it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no,    government can be carried on by declamation.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time a stranger in Brampton was enough to set the town agog. But, a young man of three and twenty, with an independent income of four, hundred dollars a year!--or any income at all not derived from his own, labor--was unheard of. It is said that when the stage from over Truro Gap, arrived in Brampton Street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen, from, various ambushes, and followed him up the walk to Silas Wheelock's, where, he was to board. In half an hour Brampton knew the essentials of Isaac, Worthington's story, and Sam Price was on his way with it to Coniston for, distribution at Jonah Winch's store.\\n\\nWetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation, had taken. It seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to face, again wish the man whom Cynthia Ware had never been able to drive from, her heart. Would, he mention her? Had he continued to love her, in spite, of the woman he had married and adorned? Wetherell asked himself these, questions before he spoke.\\n\\nMeanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in. Jabez Miller, on, the north slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that he, was going to vote for Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team and went, out to see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then plumped, the question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out. Jabez hemmed, and hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some length about the, American citizen, however humble, having a right to vote as he chose. A, most unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter very mysterious and not, a little ominous. Moses drove homeward that sparkling day, shutting his, eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines, and thinking, profoundly. He made other excursions, enough to satisfy himself that this, disease, so new and unheard of (the right of the unfit to hold office)\\n\\nand behind it was the shed, or barn, that served as the tannery, and, between the tannery and Coniston Water were the vats. The rain flew in, silvery spray, and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young man, who stood looking in at the tannery door. Young Jake Wheeler, son of the, village spendthrift, was driving a lean white horse round in a ring: to, the horse was attached a beam, and on the beam a huge round stone rolled, on a circular oak platform. Jethro Bass, who was engaged in pushing, hemlock bark under the stone to be crushed, straightened. Of the three\\n\\nThere he stood, indeed, the man of leisure, and to-day he wore his beaver, hat. No, he had not yet read the 'Last of the Mohicans.' There were, things in it that Mr. Worthington would like to discuss with Miss, Penniman. Was it not a social library? At this juncture there came a, giggle from within that made him turn scarlet, and he scarcely heard Miss, Lucretia offering to discuss the whole range of letters. Enter Mr., Worthington, bows profoundly to Miss Lucretia's guest, his beaver in his, hand, and the discussion begins, Cynthia taking no part in it. Strangely, enough, Mr. Worthington's remarks on American Indians are not only, intelligent, but interesting. The clock strikes four, Miss Lucretia, starts up, suddenly remembering that she has promised to read to an, invalid, and with many regrets from Mr. Worthington, she departs. Then he, sits down again, twirling his beaver, while Cynthia looks at him in quiet, amusement.\\n\\n\\\"Jethro Bass,\\\" said Jock, who, by reason of his ability, was a privileged, character. \\\"Mark my words, Cynthy, Jethro Bass is an all-fired sight, smarter that folks in this town think he be. They don't take notice of, him, because he don't say much, and stutters. He hain't be'n eddicated a, great deal, but I wouldn't be afeard to warrant he'd make a racket in the, world some of these days.\\\"\\n\\nOn Saturday Cynthia bought a new bonnet in Brampton; Sunday morning put, it on, suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor God, and wore, her old one; walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be, denied, and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin in, Coniston. No Jethro! General opinion (had she waited to hear it among the, horse sheds or on the green), that Jethro's soul had slid back into the, murky regions, from which it were folly for even Cynthia to try to drag, it.\\n\\nLet it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in Coniston;, and something which, for the sake of an advantageous parallel, we may, call an Established Church. Coniston was a Congregational town still, and, the deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars of, the state. Not many years before the time of which we write actual, disestablishment had occurred, when the town ceased--as a town--to pay, the salary of Priest Ware, as the minister was called. The father of, Jethro Bass, Nathan the currier, had once, in a youthful lapse, permitted, a Baptist preacher to immerse him in Coniston Water. This had been the, extent of Nathan's religion; Jethro had none at all, and was, for this, and other reasons, somewhere near the bottom of the social scale.\\n\\nThe deacon sat down, and men say that a great sob shook him, while, Jacksonian Democracy went wild--not looking into future years to see what, they were going wild about. Jethro Bass Chairman of the Board of, Selectmen, in the honored place of Deacon Moses Hatch! Bourbon royalists, never looked with greater abhorrence on the Corsican adventurer and, usurper of the throne than did the orthodox in Coniston on this tanner\\n\\nTo prove that Jethro's soul had not slid back into the murky regions, and, that it was still indulging in flights, it is necessary to follow him, (for a very short space) to Boston. Jethro himself went in Lyman Hull's, six-horse team with a load of his own merchandise--hides that he had, tanned, and other country produce. And they did not go by the way of, Truro Pass to the Capital, but took the state turnpike over the ranges\\n\\nYes, we may have our suspicions. But how can we get a bill on this, evidence? There are some thirty other individuals in Coniston whose, mortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not, likely that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; that they are going to, town meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass, wishes them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to., If so, where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our, starting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we, have the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not, know whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under, his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had, never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in, his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the, news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at, the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that\\n\\nand for some months thereafter, she kept to herself. Honest Moses Hatch, pursued his courting untroubled, and never knew that he had a rival., Moses would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as, Cynthia's changes of moods,--which were indeed the weather for him, and, when storms came he sat with his back to them, waiting for the sunshine., He had long ceased proposing marriage, in the firm belief that Cynthia, would set the day in her own good time. Thereby he was saved much, suffering.\\n\\nto the whippoorwills calling across Coniston Water. But at last a peace, descended upon him, and he slept: yes, and awoke with the same sense of, peace at little Cynthia's touch, to go out into the cool morning, when, the mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the rising sun., Behind the store was an old-fashioned garden, set about by a neat stone, wall, hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and currant bushes\\n\\nFirst I am to write a love-story of long ago, of a time some little while, after General Jackson had got into the White House and had shown the, world what a real democracy was. The Era of the first six Presidents had, closed, and a new Era had begun. I am speaking of political Eras. Certain, gentlemen, with a pious belief in democracy, but with a firmer, determination to get on top, arose,--and got in top. So many of these, gentlemen arose in the different states, and they were so clever, and, they found so many chinks in the Constitution to crawl through and steal, the people's chestnuts, that the Era may be called the Boss-Era. After, the Boss came along certain Things without souls, but of many minds, and, found more chinks in the Constitution: bigger chinks, for the Things were, bigger, and they stole more chestnuts. But I am getting far ahead of my, love-story--and of my book.\\n\\nThe parsonage was of only one story, with a steep, sloping roof. On the, left of the doorway was Cynthia's room, and the minister imagined he, heard a faint, rustling noise at her window. Presently he arose, barred, the door; could be heard moving around in his room for a while, and, after that all was silence save for the mournful crying of a whippoorwill, in the woods. Then a door opened softly, a white vision stole into the, little entry lighted by the fan-window, above, seized the book and stole, back. Had the minister been a prying man about his household, he would, have noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was burned down to the, socket. He saw nothing of the kind: he saw, in fact, that his daughter, flitted about the house singing, and he went out into the sun to drop, potatoes.\\n\\nThe price was paid, in part, during the next six days. To do Jethro's, importance absolute justice, he did inspire fear among his, contemporaries, and young men and women did not say much to his face;, what they did say gave them little satisfaction. Grim Deacon Ira stopped, him as he was going to buy hides, and would have prayed over him if, Jethro had waited; dear Aunt Lucy did pray, but in private. In six days, orthodox Coniston came to the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul, were better left to her who had snatched it, Cynthia Ware.\\n\\nAnd now we must go back for a chapter--a very short chapter--to the day, before that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon the, history of Coniston and of the state. That Monday, too, it will be, remembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the, centre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke, in agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure, on the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door., Presently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open, released a, shaft of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a face beneath, a hood to him who stood within.\\n\\n\\\"I am proud of him, everybody's proud of him, Brampton's proud of, him--he's proud of himself. That's enough, ain't it?\\\" He eyed Wetherell, somewhat defiantly, then his glance wandered to Cynthia, and he walked, over to her. He threw himself down on the grass in front of her, and lay, looking up at her solemnly. For a while she continued to stare inflexibly, at the line of market wagons, and then she burst into a laugh.\\n\\nand listening to the brief colloquies he had with other men at Jonah, Winch's store, when she went there to buy things for the parsonage; and, it seemed to her that Jock had not been altogether wrong, and that there, was in the man an indefinable but very compelling force. And when a woman, begins to admit that a man has force, her curiosity usually increases. On, one or two of these occasions Cynthia had been startled to find his eyes, fixed upon her, and though the feeling she had was closely akin to fear\\n\\nJethro Bass turned. A bench ran along the farther wall, and there he, planted himself without a word, while the clerk stared at him,--with what, feelings of uneasiness I shall not attempt to describe,--for the customer, was plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one of them, forth. The minutes passed, and Wetherell began to hate him. Then some one, tried the door, peered in through the glass, perceived Jethro, shook the, knob, knocked violently, all to no purpose. Jethro seemed lost in a, reverie.\\n\\nThe ancient allegory of Cupid and the arrows has never been improved, upon: of Cupid, who should never in the world have been trusted with a, weapon, who defies all game laws, who shoots people in the bushes and, innocent bystanders generally, the weak and the helpless and the strong, and self-confident! There is no more reason in it than that. He shot, Cynthia Ware, and what she suffered in secret Coniston never guessed., What parallels in history shall I quote to bring home the enormity of, such a mesalliance? Orthodox Coniston would have gone into sackcloth and, ashes,--was soon to go into these, anyway.\\n\\nAt last, toward the end of June, it was noised about that the great man, was coming home for a few days. One beautiful afternoon William Wetherell, stood on the platform of the store, looking off at Coniston, talking to, Moses Hatch--young Moses, who is father of six children now and has, forgotten Cynthia Ware. Old Moses sleeps on the hillside, let us hope in, the peace of the orthodox and the righteous. A cloud of dust arose above, the road to the southward, and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a, fat horse, and in the wagon the strangest couple Wetherell had ever seen., The little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in, brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce, like a paroquet, red and green, predominating. The man, big in build, large-headed, wore an old-fashioned, blue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a stock, and coonskin hat\\n\\nNow let us take the concrete incident. Before that hypocritical thaw, early in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert--not so surly then as, he has since become--and talked about buying his wool when it should be, duly cut, and permitted Amos to talk about the position of second, selectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had, nominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely, pulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a, huge snow bank and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a, little dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.\\n\\nAs the winter wore on, and March town meeting approached, strange rumors, of a Democratic ticket began to drift into Jonah Winch's store,--a, Democratic ticket headed by Fletcher Bartlett, of all men, as chairman of, the board. Moses laughed when he first heard of it, for Fletcher was an, easy-going farmer of the Methodist persuasion who was always in debt, and, the other members of the ticket, so far as Moses could learn of it--were, remarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity. The rumors persisted, and, still Moses laughed, for the senior selectman was a big man with flesh on, him, who could laugh with dignity.\\n\\nHe left a tumultuous Cynthia, amazement and repentance struggling with, anger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to, pride in him, and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride. Had he but, known it, every step he took away from her that evening was a step in, advance, and she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back. As, she walked toward Coniston, the thought came to her that she was rid of, the thing she had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into, his song once more.\\n\\nYoung Mr. Worthington was from Boston--no less; slim, pale, medium, height, but with an alert look, and a high-bridged nose. But his clothes!, Sam Price's vocabulary was insufficient here, they were cut in such a, way, and Mr. Worthington was downright distinguished-looking under his, gray beaver. Why had he come to Brampton? demanded Deacon Ira Perkins., Sam had saved this for the last. Young Mr. Worthington was threatened, with consumption, and had been sent to live with his distant relative\\n\\nCynthia Ware, who had come to the store for buttons for Speedy Bates, who, was making a new coat for the minister, heard these remarks, and stood, thoughtfully staring at the blue coat-tails of the elders. A brass button, was gone from Deacon Lysander's, and she wanted to sew it on. Suddenly, she looked up, and saw Jock Hallowell standing beside her. Jock, winked--and Cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word. She, remembered, vividly enough, what Jack had told her the spring before, and, several times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying him, and asking what he knew. But she could not summon the courage. As a, matter of fact, Jock knew nothing, but he had a theory. He was a strange, man, Jock, who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with, nobody's business, as a rule. What had impelled him to talk to Cynthia in, the way he had must remain a mystery.\\n\\nUproarious laughter greeted the end of this story, and continued in fits, as some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners., William Wetherell perceived that the conversation, for the moment at, least, was safely away from politics, and in that dubious state where it, was difficult to reopen. This was perhaps what Jethro wanted. Even Jake, Wheeler was tongue-tied, and Jethro appeared to be lost in reflection.\\n\\nThey were walking in the twilight, for the sun had sunk all red in the, marshes of the Charles, when there chanced along a certain Mr. Judson, a, jeweller, taking the air likewise. So there came into Wetherell's mind, that amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket. His name, by, reason of some strange quality in it, he had never forgotten, and, suddenly he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was, Coniston.\\n\\nCynthia, driving back from Brampton in the gig, smiled at Aunt Lucy in, the window, but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house, farther on. The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro, dwelt, and which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery, sheds were at some distance behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia did, not glance at the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation had, swept over her: at any rate, we may call it so. In other words, she was, angry with herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be told, for, her actions--an inevitable mood.\\n\\nThe Whigs have theirs written out, Deacon Moses Hatch. But who has, written out these others that are being so assiduously passed around? Sam, Price, perhaps, for he is passing them most assiduously. And what name is, written on them? Fletcher Bartlett, of course; that was on the ticket., Somebody is tricked again. That is not the name on the ticket. Look over, Sara Price's shoulder and you will see the name--Jethro Bass.\\n\\nIt was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor Moses, and he, learned of it when he went to Jonah Winch's store an hour later. An hour, later, indeed, Coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a new light., It was possible that Cynthia might take him, and Deacon Ira Perkins made, a note the next time he went to Brampton to question Silas Wheelock on, Mr. Worthington's origin, habits, and orthodoxy.\\n\\nThe celebrated Social Library, halfway up the street, occupied part of, Miss Lucretia's little house; or, it might better be said, Miss Lucretia, boarded with the Social Library. There Cynthia hitched her horse, gave, greeting to Mr. Ezra Graves and others who paused, and, before she was, fairly in the door, was clasped in Miss Lucretia's arms. There were new, books to be discussed, arrived by the stage the day before; but scarce, half an hour had passed before Cynthia started guiltily at a timid knock\\n\\napparently, to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for, circulation. That Wetherell shared this excitement, too, he could not, deny, but for a different cause. At last, when the shadows of the big, trees had crept across the green, he came, the customers flocking to the, porch to greet him, Wetherell standing curiously behind them in the door., Heedless of the dust, he strode down the road with the awkward gait that, was all his own, kicking up his heels behind. And behind him, heels, kicking up likewise, followed Jake and Sam, Jethro apparently oblivious, of their presence. A modest silence was maintained from the stoop, broken, at length by Lem Hallowell, who (men said) was an exact reproduction of, Jock, the meeting-house builder. Lem alone was not abashed in the, presence of greatness.\\n\\nCynthia was not only the minister's daughter,--distinction enough,--her, reputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout, and at, the age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in Harwich. Once a, week in summer she went to Brampton, to the Social library there, and sat, at the feet of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom Brampton has ever been, so proud--Lucretia Penniman, one of the first to sound the clarion note, for the intellectual independence of American women; who wrote the \\\"Hymn, to Coniston\\\"; who, to the awe of her townspeople, went out into the great, world and became editress of a famous woman's journal, and knew, Longfellow and Hawthorne and Bryant. Miss Lucretia it was who started the, Brampton Social Library, and filled it with such books as both sexes, might read with profit. Never was there a stricter index than hers., Cynthia, Miss Lucretia loved, and the training of that mind was the, pleasantest task of her life.\\n\\nMonday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still, refer, and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which, we shall have to pass by for the present; on Tuesday, the sleet still, raging, came the historic town meeting. Deacon Moses Hatch, his chores, done and his breakfast and prayers completed, fought his way with his, head down through a white waste to the meeting-house door, and unlocked, it, and shivered as he made the fire. It was certainly not good election, weather, thought Moses, and others of the orthodox persuasion, high in, office, were of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails, before the stove. Whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes\\n\\nJethro stepped out, passing Mr. Worthington as though he had already, forgotten that gentleman's existence, and seized an armful of bark that, lay under cover of a lean-to. Just then, heralded by a brightening of the, western sky, a girl appeared down the road, her head bent a little as in, thought, and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave no sign., Two of them stared at her--Jake Wheeler and Mr. Worthington. Suddenly, Jake, implike, turned and stared at Worthington.\\n\\nContrast is a favorite trick of authors, and no greater contrast is to be, had in Coniston than that between Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. In the, first place; Cynthia was the minister's daughter, and twenty-one. I can, summon her now under the great maples of the village street, a virginal, figure, gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke bonnet, and up, you went above the clouds.\\n\\nalthough he could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free, Library and the Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the, church and the great marble monument on the hill--to another woman. All, of these things, and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only, accepted that promise to pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle, more robust than when he came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she, doubted his promise to pay.\\n\\nactually existed. Where the germ began that caused it, Moses knew no, better than the deacon, since those who were suspected of leanings toward, Fletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive. The practical result of, Moses' profound thought was a meeting, in his own house, without respect, to party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened by a prayer from the minister, himself. The meeting, after a futile session, broke up dismally. Sedition, and conspiracy existed; a chief offender and master mind there was\\n\\nIt is a fact--for future consideration--that Isaac Worthington proposed, to Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira Perkins, heard him do so. It had been very carefully prepared, that speech, and, was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr., Worthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to be--not, for what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large amount\\n\\nThis man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized and, marshalled the loose vote, was the author of that ticket, who sat in his, corner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the, maledictions of his enemies; who rose to take his oath of office as, unconcerned as though the house were empty, albeit Deacon Lysander could, scarcely get the words out. And then Jethro sat down again in his, chair--not to leave it for six and thirty years. From this time forth, that chair became a seat of power, and of dominion over a state.\\n\\nflows southward around the south end of Coniston Mountain, and having, turned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows westward in its own, green valley until it comes to Harwich, where it works again and tumbles, into a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals, but Coniston Water gives, of its power impartially to each. From the little farm clearings on the, western slope of Coniston Mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a, certain broad river where grew (and grow still) the giant pines that gave, many a mast to King George's navy as tribute for the land. And beyond, that river rises beautiful Farewell Mountain of many colors, now, sapphire, now amethyst, its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron, flame; and, beyond Farewell, the emerald billows of the western peaks, catching the level light. A dozen little brooks are born high among the, western spruces on Coniston to score deep, cool valleys in their way, through Clovelly township to the broad music of the water and fresh, river-valleys full of the music of the water and fresh with the odor of, the ferns.\",\n          \"The command was given in his most imperious manner, and his daughter, dropped her muff in some resentment as she rose, in order to let him have, the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hardy pick it up.  It rolled, however, in his, direction, and he stooped for it just as Hardy darted forward.  Their, heads met with a crash, and Miss Nugent forgot her own consternation in, the joy of beholding the pitiable exhibition which terror made of Mr., Wilks.\\n\\nFor some days, however, he looked for Jack Nugent in vain, that gentleman, either being out of doors engaged in an earnest search for work, or, snugly seated in the back parlour of the Kybirds, indulging in the, somewhat perilous pastime of paying compliments to Amelia Kybird., Remittances which had reached him from his sister and aunt had been, promptly returned, and he was indebted to the amiable Mr. Kybird for the, bare necessaries of life.  In these circumstances a warm feeling of, gratitude towards the family closed his eyes to their obvious, shortcomings.\\n\\nThe captain, hardly able to believe his ears, came to an impressive stop, in the roadway, but Miss Nugent walked on.  She felt instinctively that, the joke was thrown away on him, and, in the absence of any other, audience, wanted to enjoy it without interruption.  Convulsive and, half-suppressed sounds, which she ascribed to a slight cold caught while, waiting in the kitchen, escaped her at intervals for the remainder of the, journey home.\\n\\nBoth men protested.  The captain because it ill-assorted with his dignity, for his daughter to sit in the kitchen, and Mr. Wilks because of the, visitor already there.  The face of the steward, indeed, took on such, extraordinary expressions in his endeavour to convey private information, to the girl that she gazed at him in silent amazement.  Then she turned, the handle of the door and, passing through, closed it with a bang which, was final.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't,\\\" said Mr. Nugent, truthfully.  The situation had developed so, rapidly that it had caught him at a disadvantage.  He had a dim feeling, that, having been the cause of Miss Kybird's losing one young man, the, most elementary notions of chivalry demanded that he should furnish her, with another.  And this idea was clearly uppermost in the minds of her, parents.  He looked over at Amelia and with characteristic philosophy, accepted the position.\\n\\nTime failed to soften the captain's ideas concerning his son's, engagement, and all mention of the subject in the house was strictly, forbidden.  Occasionally he was favoured with a glimpse of his son and, Miss Kybird out together, a sight which imparted such a flavour to his, temper and ordinary intercourse that Mrs. Kingdom, in unconscious, imitation of Mr. James Hardy, began to count the days which must elapse, before her niece's return from London.  His ill-temper even infected the, other members of the household, and Mrs. Kingdom sat brooding in her, bedroom all one afternoon, because Bella had called her an \\\"overbearing, dish-pot.\\\"\\n\\nBefore he saw Kate Nugent again, however, another old acquaintance turned, up safe and sound in Sunwich.  Captain Nugent walking into the town saw, him first: a tall, well-knit young man in shabby clothing, whose bearing, even in the distance was oddly familiar.  As he came closer the captain's, misgivings were confirmed, and in the sunburnt fellow in tattered clothes, who advanced upon him with out-stretched hand he reluctantly recognized, his son.\\n\\nAt these valuables Jack Nugent, with a view of obtaining some idea of, prices, gazed for some time.  Then passing between two suits of oilskins, which stood as sentinels in the doorway, he entered the shop and smiled, affably at Miss Kybird, who was in charge.  At his entrance she put down, a piece of fancy-work, which Mr. Kybird called his sock, and with a, casual glance at his clothes regarded him with a prejudiced eye.\\n\\nHe even obtained work down at the harbour through a friend of Mr., Kybird's.  It was not of a very exalted nature, and caused more strain, upon the back than the intellect, but seven years of roughing it had left, him singularly free from caste prejudices, a freedom which he soon, discovered was not shared by his old acquaintances at Sunwich.  The, discovery made him somewhat bitter, and when Hardy stopped him one, afternoon as he was on his way home from work he tried to ignore his, outstretched hand and continued on his way.\\n\\nThey were more surprised an evening or two later to see Mr. Wilks leave, his house to pay a return visit, bearing in his hand a small bunch of his, cherished blooms.  That they were blooms which would have paid the debt, of Nature in a few hours at most in no way detracted from the widow's, expressions of pleasure at receiving them, and Mr. Wilks, who had been, invited over to cheer up Mr. Silk, who was in a particularly black mood\\n\\nHe looked up the street, and then, the well-known shop of Mr. Kybird, catching his eye, walked over and inspected the contents of the window., Sheath-knives, belts, tobacco-boxes, and watches were displayed, alluringly behind the glass, sheltered from the sun by a row of cheap, clothing dangling from short poles over the shop front.  All the goods, were marked in plain figures in reduced circumstances, Mr. Kybird giving, a soaring imagination play in the first marking, and a good business, faculty in the second.\\n\\nThe object of Mr. Hardy's search sat at the door of his front room, which, opened on to the alley, smoking an evening pipe, and noting with an, interested eye the doings of his neighbours.  He was just preparing to, draw himself up in his chair as the intruder passed, when to his utter, astonishment that gentleman stopped in front of him, and taking, possession of his hand shook it fervently.\\n\\nTheir talk was mainly of Sunwich and Sunwich people, and it was an easy, step from these to Equator Lodge.  On that subject most people would have, found the ex-steward somewhat garrulous, but Jem Hardy listened with, great content, and even brought him back to it when he showed signs of, wandering.  Altogether Mr. Wilks spent one of the pleasantest evenings of, his life, and, returning home in a slight state of mental exhilaration\\n\\nHe walked home somewhat soberly at first, but the air was cool and fresh, and a glorious moon was riding in the sky.  He whistled cheerfully, and, his spirits rose as various chimerical plans of making money occurred to, him.  By the time he reached the High Street, the shops of which were all, closed for the night, he was earning five hundred a year and spending a, thousand.  He turned the handle of the door and, walking in, discovered, Miss Kybird entertaining company in the person of Mr. Edward Silk.\\n\\nThere was something about the vessel which took his fancy, and he stood, for some time on the edge of the quay, looking at her.  In a day or two, she would sail for a voyage the length of which would depend upon her, success; a voyage which would for a long period keep all on board of her, out of the mischief which so easily happens ashore.  If only Jack----\\n\\nThe honour was so unexpected that Mr. Wilks, coming into the parlour in, response to the tapping of the captain's stick on the floor, stood for a, short time eyeing him in dismay.  Only two minutes before he had taken, Mr. James Hardy into the kitchen to point out the interior beauties of, an ancient clock, and the situation simply appalled him.  The captain, greeted him almost politely and bade him sit down.  Mr. Wilks smiled, faintly and caught his breath.\\n\\ncalmly observant, the slightest suggestion of disdain in her expression., Framed in the queer, high-backed old chair which had belonged to Mr., Wilks's grandfather, she made a picture at which Jem Hardy continued to, gaze with respectful ardour.  A hopeless sense of self-depreciation, possessed him, but the idea that Murchison should aspire to so much, goodness and beauty made him almost despair of his sex.  His reverie was, broken by the voice of Mr. Wilks.\\n\\nThe anticipations of Mr. Wilks were more than realized on the following, Tuesday.  From the time a trim maid showed him into the smoking-room, until late at night, when he left, a feted and honoured guest, with one, of his host's best cigars between his teeth, nothing that could yield him, any comfort was left undone.  In the easiest of easy chairs he sat in the, garden beneath the leafy branches of apple trees, and undiluted wisdom, and advice flowed from his lips in a stream as he beamed delightedly upon, his entertainer.\\n\\nOne by one various schemes for preventing his son's projected alliance, were dismissed as impracticable.  A cherished design of confining him in, an asylum for the mentally afflicted until such time as he should have, regained his senses was spoilt by the refusal of Dr. Murchison to arrange, for the necessary certificate; a refusal which was like to have been, fraught with serious consequences to that gentleman's hopes of entering, the captain's family.\\n\\nThe shopkeeper stood considering.  He had a small room to let at the top, of his house, and he stood divided between the fear of not getting his, rent and the joy to a man fond of simple pleasures, to be obtained by, dunning the arrogant Captain Nugent for his son's debts.  Before he could, arrive at a decision his meditations were interrupted by the entrance of, a stout, sandy-haired lady from the back parlour, who, having conquered, his scruples against matrimony some thirty years before, had kept a, particularly wide-awake eye upon him ever since.\\n\\nIn the next room conversation was also proceeding, but fitfully.  Miss, Nugent's consternation when she closed the door behind her and found, herself face to face with Mr. Hardy was difficult of concealment.  Too, late she understood the facial contortions of Mr. Wilks, and, resigning, herself to the inevitable, accepted the chair placed for her by the, highly pleased Jem, and sat regarding him calmly from the other side of, the fender.\\n\\nMiss Nugent eyed him wistfully and racked her brains for an appropriate, and crushing rejoinder.  In all her experience--and it was considerable, considering her years--she had never met with such carefully constructed, audacity, and she longed, with a great longing, to lure him into the open, and destroy him.  She was still considering ways and means of doing this, when the door opened and revealed the surprised and angry form of her, father and behind it the pallid countenance of Mr. Wilks.  For a moment, anger deprived the captain of utterance.\\n\\nThe most astounding and gratifying instance of the wonders effected by, time was that of Miss Nugent.  He saw her first at the window, and with a, ready recognition of the enchantment lent by distance took the first, possible opportunity of a closer observation.  He then realized the, enchantment afforded by proximity.  The second opportunity led him, impetuously into a draper's shop, where a magnificent shop-walker, after, first ceremoniously handing him a high cane chair, passed on his order, for pins in a deep and thrilling baritone, and retired in good order.\\n\\nMr. Nugent's return caused a sensation in several quarters, the feeling, at Equator Lodge bordering close upon open mutiny.  Even Mrs. Kingdom, plucked up spirit and read the astonished captain a homily upon the first, duties of a parent--a homily which she backed up by reading the story of, the Prodigal Son through to the bitter end.  At the conclusion she broke, down entirely and was led up to bed by Kate and Bella, the sympathy of, the latter taking an acute form, and consisting mainly of innuendoes, which could only refer to one person in the house.\\n\\nUpstairs in the tiny room under the tiles Mr. Jack Nugent, in blissful, ignorance of his landlord's generous sentiments towards him, slept the, sound, dreamless sleep of the man free from monetary cares.  In the, sanctity of her chamber Miss Kybird, gazing approvingly at the reflection, of her yellow hair and fine eyes in the little cracked looking-glass, was, already comparing him very favourably with the somewhat pessimistic Mr., Silk.\\n\\nand turned a deaf ear to the voluble sympathy of his neighbours.  Similar, things had happened to young men living there before, but their behaviour, had been widely different to Mr. Silk's.  Bob Crump, for instance, had, been jilted on the very morning he had arranged for his wedding, but, instead of going about in a state of gentle melancholy he went round and, fought his beloved's father--merely because it was her father--and wound, up an exciting day by selling off his household goods to the highest, bidders.  Henry Jones in similar circumstances relieved his great grief, by walking up and down the alley smashing every window within reach of, his stick.\\n\\nMeantime they passed each other as strangers, and the difficulty of, approaching her only made the task more alluring.  In the second week he, reckoned up that he had seen her nine times.  It was a satisfactory, total, but at the same time he could not shut his eyes to the fact that, five times out of that number he had seen Dr. Murchison as well, and, neither of them appeared to have seen him.\\n\\nHe started and stared more intently than before.  He was not an, imaginative man, but he had in his mind's eye a sudden vision of his only, son waving farewells from the deck of the whaler as she emerged from the, harbour into the open sea, while Amelia Kybird tore her yellow locks, ashore.  It was a vision to cheer any self-respecting father's heart, and, he brought his mind back with some regret to the reality of the anchored, ship.\\n\\nBrooding over his wrongs the captain, a day or two after his daughter's, return, strolled slowly down towards the harbour.  It was afternoon, and, the short winter day was already drawing towards a close.  The shipping, looked cold and desolate in the greyness, but a bustle of work prevailed, on the Conqueror, which was nearly ready for sea again.  The captain's, gaze wandered from his old craft to the small vessels dotted about the, harbour and finally dwelt admiringly on the lines of the whaler Seabird\\n\\nMr. Wilks nodded, and despite his hostess's protests rose to go.  He, shook hands with her and, after a short but sharp inward struggle, shook, hands with her son.  It was late in the evening as he left, but the, houses had not yet been lit up.  Dim figures sat in doorways or stood, about the alley, and there was an air of peace and rest strangely and, uncomfortably in keeping with the conversation to which he had just been, listening.  He looked in at his own door; the furniture seemed stiffer, than usual and the tick of the clock more deliberate.  He closed the door, again and, taking a deep breath, set off towards the life and bustle of, the Two Schooners.\\n\\nThe remark was certainly descriptive of Mr. Nugent's behaviour.  His easy, assurance and affability had already made him a prime favourite with Mrs., Kybird, and had not been without its effect upon her daughter.  The, constrained and severe company manners of Mr. Edward Silk showed up but, poorly beside those of the paying guest, and Miss Kybird had on several, occasions drawn comparisons which would have rendered both gentlemen, uneasy if they had known of them.\\n\\nA sudden wave of colour swept over the girl's face at the ingenuity of, this mode of attack.  She was used to attention and took compliments as, her due, but the significant audacity of this one baffled her.  She sat, with downcast eyes looking at the fender occasionally glancing from the, corner of her eye to see whether he was preparing to renew the assault., He had certainly changed from the Jem Hardy of olden days.  She had a, faint idea that his taste had improved.\\n\\nHe walked home slowly.  At the Kybirds' door the proprietor, smoking a, short clay pipe, eyed him with furtive glee as he passed.  Farther along, the road the Hardys, father and son, stepped briskly together., Altogether a trying walk, and calculated to make him more dissatisfied, than ever with the present state of affairs.  When his daughter shook her, head at him and accused him of going off on a solitary frolic his stock, of patience gave out entirely.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Their, eyes moved together from piece to piece, taking in the whole, nobleness--quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old, ideas. The two noble persons seated, in conversation, at tea\\n\\nIf they were ever to go, in short, it was high time, with her, father's age, Charlotte's need of initiation, and the general, magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned, their, learning to \\\"live into\\\" their queer future--it was high time that, they should take up their courage. This was eminent sense, but it, didn't arrest the Princess, who, the next moment, had found a, form for her challenge. \\\"But shan't you then so much as miss her, a little? She's wonderful and beautiful, and I feel somehow as if, she were dying. Not really, not physically,\\\" Maggie went on--, \\\"she's so far, naturally, splendid as she is, from having done, with life. But dying for us--for you and me; and making us feel, it by the very fact of there being so much of her left.\\\"\\n\\nShe couldn't have been sure beforehand, and had really not been;, but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her, see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or, of oblivion. Nothing in the world, of a truth, had ever been so, sweet to her, as his look of trying to be serious enough to make, no mistake about it. She troubled him--which hadn't been at all, her purpose; she mystified him--which she couldn't help and\\n\\nvisibly, her idea--that of not betraying herself by inattentions, into which she had never yet fallen, and she stood there circled, about and furnished forth, as always, in a manner that testified, to her perfect little personal processes. It had ever been her, sign that she was, for all occasions, FOUND ready, without loose, ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities; a, suggestion of the swept and garnished, in her whole splendid, yet, thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting, that, reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry, for, objects with their backs to the walls, and spoke even of some, probable reference, in her American blood, to dusting and, polishing New England grandmothers. If her apartment was, \\\"princely,\\\" in the clearness of the lingering day, she looked as, if she had been carried there prepared, all attired and, decorated, like some holy image in a procession, and left\\n\\nFor a minute after this they remained face to face; Maggie had, sprung up while her friend sat enthroned, and, after moving to, and fro in her intensity, now paused to receive the light she had, invoked. It had accumulated, considerably, by this time, round, Mrs. Assingham's ample presence, and it made, even to our young, woman's own sense, a medium in which she could at last take a, deeper breath. \\\"I've affected you, these months--and these last, weeks in especial--as quiet and natural and easy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For your father. For whom else?\\\" They looked at each other hard, now, but Maggie's face took refuge in the intensity of her, interest. She was not at all even so stupid as to treat her, companion's question as requiring an answer; a discretion that, her controlled stillness had after an instant justified. \\\"I, must risk your thinking me selfish--for of course you know what, it involves. Let me admit it--I AM selfish. I place my husband, first.\\\"\\n\\nHe saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could, at the, best, but stand aside to watch her and let her pass; he only made, a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture. \\\"I'm, sorry to say any ill of your friends, and the thing was a long, time ago; besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it., But I remember the man's striking me as a decided little beast.\\\"\\n\\nYes, Charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar, and had, stopped now to put her further attention to the test. Her face, was fixed on her, through the night; she was the creature who had, escaped by force from her cage, yet there was in her whole motion, assuredly, even as so dimly discerned, a kind of portentous, intelligent stillness. She had escaped with an intention, but, with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with, quiet measures. The two women, at all events, only hovered there\\n\\nbut there was something in such an appearance, in the look it put, into the eyes, that renewed Maggie's conviction of what this, companion had been expecting. She had been watching it come, come, from afar, and now that it was there, after all, and the first, convulsion over, they would doubtless soon find themselves in a, more real relation. It was there because of the Sunday luncheon, they had partaken of alone together; it was there, as strangely, as one would, because of the bad weather, the cold perverse June, rain, that was making the day wrong; it was there because it, stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among, which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her, steps; it was there because Amerigo and Charlotte were again, paying together alone a \\\"week end\\\" visit which it had been, Maggie's plan infernally to promote--just to see if, this time\\n\\nany slightest value, of consciousness; and then felt the slow, surge of a vision that, at the end of another minute or two, had, floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at, a picture, an early Florentine sacred subject, that he had given, her on her marriage. He might have been, in silence, taking his, last leave of it; it was a work for which he entertained, she, knew, an unqualified esteem. The tenderness represented for her, by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become, to her sense, a, part of the whole infusion, of the immortal expression; the, beauty of his sentiment looked out at her, always, from the, beauty of the rest, as if the frame made positively a window for, his spiritual face: she might have said to herself, at this, moment, that in leaving the thing behind him, held as in her, clasping arms, he was doing the most possible toward leaving her, a part of his palpable self. She put her hand over his shoulder\\n\\nShe had considered here, and never in her life had she considered, so promptly and so intently. If she really put it that way, her, husband, challenged, might belie the statement; so that what, would that do but make her father wonder, make him perhaps ask, straight out, why she was exerting pressure? She couldn't of, course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting, pressure; which was why she was obliged only to make answer:, \\\"Wouldn't that be just what you must have out with HIM?\\\"\\n\\nIt was not till many days had passed that the Princess began to, accept the idea of having done, a little, something she was not, always doing, or indeed that of having listened to any inward, voice that spoke in a new tone. Yet these instinctive, postponements of reflection were the fruit, positively, of, recognitions and perceptions already active; of the sense, above, all, that she had made, at a particular hour, made by the mere, touch of her hand, a difference in the situation so long present, to her as practically unattackable. This situation had been, occupying, for months and months, the very centre of the garden, of her life, but it had reared itself there like some strange\\n\\nhad its hours of strange beguilement--those at which her sense, for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her, communion with him more intimate than any other. It COULDN'T but, pass between them that something singular was happening--so much, as this she again and again said to herself; whereby the comfort, of it was there, after all, to be noted, just as much as the, possible peril, and she could think of the couple they formed, together as groping, with sealed lips, but with mutual looks that, had never been so tender, for some freedom, some fiction, some, figured bravery, under which they might safely talk of it. The, moment was to come--and it finally came with an effect as, penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric, button--when she read the least helpful of meanings into the, agitation she had created. The merely specious description of, their case would have been that, after being for a long time, as, a family, delightfully, uninterruptedly happy, they had still had, a new felicity to discover; a felicity for which, blessedly, her, father's appetite and her own, in particular, had been kept fresh, and grateful. This livelier march of their intercourse as a whole, was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching, instinct we have glanced at; very much as if he had said to her\\n\\non their second and shorter interview, in Portland Place, and, quite at the end of this passage, she had imagined him positively, proposing to her a temporary accommodation. It had been but the, matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed, upon her, and she had found in it, the more she kept it before, her, the tacitly-offered sketch of a working arrangement. \\\"Leave, me my reserve; don't question it--it's all I have, just now\\n\\nwhere she had the thrill of seeing it, with the violence of the, crash, lie shattered. She had flushed with the force of her, effort, as Maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight, and this, high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them, for a minute more. After which, \\\"Whatever you meant by it--and I, don't want to know NOW--has ceased to exist,\\\" Mrs. Assingham, said.\\n\\ninvariably, the sense of making her danger present, of making it, real, to her husband, and of his almost turning pale, when their, eyes met, at this possibility of their compromised state and, their shared discredit. The beauty was that, as under a touch of, one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard, he sounded, out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man., \\\"Conspiring--so far as YOU were concerned--to what end?\\\"\\n\\nAt this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet, her opportunity to say, and it held her for a minute as in a, vise, her impression of his now, with his strained smile, which, touched her to deepest depths, sounding her in his secret unrest., This was the moment, in the whole process of their mutual, vigilance, in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their, thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch. It shook, between them, this transparency, with their very breath; it was, an exquisite tissue, but stretched on a frame, and would give way, the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard. She held, her breath, for she knew by his eyes, the light at the heart of, which he couldn't blind, that he was, by his intention, making, sure--sure whether or no her certainty was like his. The, intensity of his dependence on it at that moment--this itself was, what absolutely convinced her so that, as if perched up before, him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his, observation, she balanced for thirty seconds, she almost rocked:, she might have been for the time, in all her conscious person\\n\\nwith a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism, to, each member of the party in turn; sustaining and bracing herself, by her emphasis, pushed even to an amiable cynicism, of the, confident view of these punctualities of the Assinghams. The, ground she could best occupy, to her sense, was that of her being, moved, as in this connexion she had always been moved, by the, admitted grossness of her avidity, the way the hospitality of the, Ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease, destitute, as the Colonel had kept her, from the first, of any rustic, retreat, any leafy bower of her own, any fixed base for the stale, season now at hand. She had explained at home, she had repeatedly, reexplained, the terms of her dilemma, the real difficulty of, her, or--as she now put it--of their, position. When the pair, could do nothing else, in Cadogan Place, they could still talk of, marvellous little Maggie, and of the charm, the sinister charm\\n\\nShe saw him, in truth, less easily beguiled--saw him wander, in, the closed dusky rooms, from place to place, or else, for long, periods, recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the, smoke of ceaseless cigarettes. She made him out as liking better, than anything in the world just now to be alone with his, thoughts. Being herself connected with his thoughts, she, continued to believe, more than she had ever been, it was thereby, a good deal as if he were alone with HER. She made him out as, resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which, he was exposed at Fawns; and she was accessible to the impression, of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative. It was like, his doing penance in sordid ways--being sent to prison or being, kept without money; it wouldn't have taken much to make her think, of him as really kept without food. He might have broken away\\n\\nvisibly, so much her friend as at that moment--had braced herself, to so amazing an energy, and there, under Amerigo's eyes, she, picked up the shining pieces. Bedizened and jewelled, in her, rustling finery, she paid, with humility of attitude, this prompt, tribute to order--only to find, however, that she could carry but, two of the fragments at once. She brought them over to the, chimney-piece, to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup, before Fanny's appropriation of it, and, after laying them, carefully down, went back for what remained, the solid detached, foot. With this she returned to the mantel-shelf, placing it with, deliberation in the centre and then, for a minute, occupying, herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels. After she, had squared again her little objects on the chimney, she was, within an ace, in fact, of turning on him with that appeal;, besides its being lucid for her, all the while, that the occasion, was passing, that they were dining out, that he wasn't dressed\\n\\nwhen the particular question had come up for them the then, purblind discussion of which, at their enjoyed leisure, Maggie, had formed the habit of regarding as the \\\"first beginning\\\" of, their present situation. The whirligig of time had thus brought, round for them again, on their finding themselves face to face, while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace, the same, odd impulse quietly to \\\"slope\\\"--so Adam Verver himself, as they, went, familiarly expressed it--that had acted, in its way, of, old; acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness, of their since so outlived crisis. It might have been funny to, them now that the presence of Mrs. Rance and the Lutches--and, with symptoms, too, at that time less developed--had once, for, their anxiety and their prudence, constituted a crisis; it might, have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured, to, their imagination, as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to, precipitate the need of a remedy. This amount of entertainment, and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their, actual impressions; they had been finding it, for months past, by, Maggie's view, a resource and a relief to talk, with an approach, to intensity, when they met, of all the people they weren't, really thinking of and didn't really care about, the people with, whom their existence had begun almost to swarm; and they closed, in at present round the spectres of their past, as they permitted, themselves to describe the three ladies, with a better imitation, of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve\\n\\ntaking them as they were; he might make some sign--she scarce, knew what--that would save her; save her from being the one, this, way, to pay all. He might somehow show a preference--, distinguishing between them; might, out of pity for her, signal, to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he, asked. That represented Maggie's one little lapse from, consistency--the sole small deflection in the whole course of her, scheme. It had come to nothing the next minute, for the dear, man's eyes had never moved, and Charlotte's hand, promptly passed, into her arm, had already, had very firmly drawn her on--quite\\n\\n\\\"Yes, as I say, it was while she was with me. But I didn't know, it. That is,\\\" said Fanny Assingham, \\\"I didn't know of anything in, particular.\\\" It sounded weak--that she felt; but she had really, her point to make. \\\"What I mean is that I don't know, for, knowledge, now, anything I didn't then. That's how I am.\\\" She, still, however, floundered. \\\"I mean it's how I WAS.\\\"\\n\\nwith no secret but her own. What occurred was simply that she, became aware, at a stroke, of the quantity of further nourishment, required by her own, and of the amount of it she might somehow, extract from these people; whereby she rose, of a sudden, to the, desire to possess and use them, even to the extent of braving, of, fairly defying, of directly exploiting, of possibly quite, enjoying, under cover of an evil duplicity, the felt element of, curiosity with which they regarded her. Once she was conscious of, the flitting wing of this last impression--the perception\\n\\nby remembering that the real \\\"relation\\\" between her father and, his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that, in, strictness, was none of her business; but she none the less, failed to keep quiet, as she would have called it, before the, projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation. Nothing, could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain, queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her, a wish that, usurped, perversely, the place of a much more natural one. If, Charlotte, while she was about it, could only have been WORSE!--, that idea Maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she, might desirably have been better. For, exceedingly odd as it was, to feel in such ways, she believed she mightn't have worried so, much if she didn't somehow make her stepmother out, under the, beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens, as lavish of, fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds, at least, of, gentleness. Gentleness and confidence were certainly the right, thing, as from a charming woman to her husband, but the fine, tissue of reassurance woven by this lady's hands and flung over, her companion as a light, muffling veil, formed precisely a, wrought transparency through which she felt her father's eyes, continually rest on herself. The reach of his gaze came to her, straighter from a distance; it showed him as still more, conscious, down there alone, of the suspected, the felt, elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him., She had herself now, for weeks and weeks, and all unwinkingly\\n\\nMaggie waited a little; she had for some time, now, kept her eyes, on him steadily; but they wandered, at this, to the fragments on, her chimney. \\\"Yes; it comes round, after all, to your having got, me the bowl. I myself was to come upon it, the other day, by so, wonderful a chance; was to find it in the same place and to have, it pressed upon me by the same little man, who does, as you say\\n\\nmore or less differently. Of that inevitability, of such other, ranges of response as were open to Charlotte, Maggie took the, measure in approaching her, on the morrow of her return from, Matcham, with the same show of desire to hear all her story. She, wanted the whole picture from her, as she had wanted it from her, companion, and, promptly, in Eaton Square, whither, without the, Prince, she repaired, almost ostentatiously, for the purpose\\n\\nThe assurance of his speech, she could note, quite held up its, head in him; his eyes met her own so, for the declaration, that, it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed, upon her, from afar off, out of his strange consistency. She kept, her direction still, however, under that. \\\"Oh, the thing I've, known best of all is that you've never wanted, together, to, offend us. You've wanted quite intensely not to, and the, precautions you've had to take for it have been for a long time, one of the strongest of my impressions. That, I think,\\\" she, added, \\\"is the way I've best known.\\\"\\n\\nof the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this, resource, the more it came back to her as the product of a, conscious art of dealing with her. He had been conscious, at the, moment, of many things--conscious even, not a little, of, desiring; and thereby of needing, to see what she would do in a, given case. The given case would be that of her being to a, certain extent, as she might fairly make it out, MENACED--, horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by, such a word. Why it was that to speak of making her stepmother, intervene, as they might call it, in a question that seemed, just, then and there, quite peculiarly their own business--why it was, that a turn so familiar and so easy should, at the worst, strike, her as charged with the spirit of a threat, was an oddity, disconnected, for her, temporarily, from its grounds, the, adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its, way. That, precisely, was doubtless why she had learned to wait\\n\\nsuccessions of pretty women, the theory of his fond interest in, whom had been publicly cultivated. It had never occurred to his, wife to pronounce him ingenuous, but there came at last a high, dim August dawn when she couldn't sleep and when, creeping, restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of, wooded acres, she found the faint flush of the east march with, the perception of that other almost equal prodigy. It rosily, coloured her vision that--even such as he was, yes--her husband, could on occasion sin by excess of candour. He wouldn't otherwise, have given as his reason for going up to Portland Place in the, August days that he was arranging books there. He had bought a, great many of late, and he had had others, a large number, sent, from Rome--wonders of old print in which her father had been, interested. But when her imagination tracked him to the dusty, town, to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds, where a, caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession, it wasn't, to see him, in his shirtsleeves, unpacking battered boxes.\\n\\n\\\"Then there you are.\\\" But Maggie had turned away, moving to the, window, as if still to keep something in her face from sight. She, stood there with her eyes on the street while Mrs. Assingham's, reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which, her condition, so oddly even to herself, was that both of, recurrent wonder and recurrent protest. She went over it, looked, at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her, hands. She laid them on it, lifting it up, and was surprised\\n\\nBut it was a question that took, not imperceptibly, some, answering. \\\"You've never affected me, from the first hour I, beheld you, as anything but--in a way all your own--absolutely, good and sweet and beautiful. In a way, as I say,\\\" Mrs. Assingham, almost caressingly repeated, \\\"just all your very own--nobody, else's at all. I've never thought of you but as OUTSIDE of ugly, things, so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as, never to have to be touched by them or to touch them. I've never, mixed you up with them; there would have been time enough for, that if they had seemed to be near you. But they haven't--if, that's what you want to know.\\\"\\n\\nthis made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she, perhaps might never be able to profit again. She was invoking, that reflection at the very moment he brought out, in reply to, her last words, a remark which, though perfectly relevant and, perfectly just, affected her at first as a high oddity. \\\"They're, doing the wisest thing, you know. For if they were ever to, go--!\\\" And he looked down at her over his cigar.\\n\\nfor the completeness of her image, Maggie was now supremely to, feel how every strain had been lightened for herself. So far as, SHE was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place; since, the work was done for her she felt no weight, and it wasn't too, much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round. She had a, long pause before the fire during which she might have been, fixing with intensity her projected vision, have been conscious, even of its taking an absurd, fantastic shape. She might have, been watching the family coach pass and noting that, somehow\\n\\nI had, before that, my idea--which you never dreamed I had. From, the moment I speak of it had more to go upon, and you became, yourselves, you and she, vaguely, yet uneasily, conscious of the, difference. But it's within these last hours that I've most seen, where we are; and as I've been in communication with Fanny, Assingham about my doubts, so I wanted to let her know my, certainty--with the determination of which, however, you must, understand, she has had nothing to do. She defends you,\\\" Maggie, remarked.\\n\\nfor these first minutes, face to face over their interval and, exchanging no sign; the intensity of their mutual look might have, pierced the night, and Maggie was at last to start with the, scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt, to dread, to, hesitation, for a time that, with no other proof needed, would, have completely given her away. How long had she stood staring?--, a single minute or five? Long enough, in any case, to have felt, herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the, latter threw upon her, irresistibly, by this effect of silence\\n\\nEven to that indeed, she could reflect, Charlotte might have, replied that it was easy to say; even to that no great meaning, could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw, hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving, his spell, weaving it off there by himself. In whatever quarter, of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed, as absorbed in this occupation; and Maggie was to become aware of, two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the, hint that he measured the impression he produced. It was not, really till after their recent long talk in the park that she, knew how deeply, how quite exhaustively, they had then, communicated--so that they were to remain together, for the time\\n\\nspringing up under her wrong and making them all start, stare and, turn pale, she might sound out their doom in a single sentence, a, sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid--after she had, faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness, she rose, from her place, laying aside her magazine, and moved slowly round, the room, passing near the card-players and pausing an instant, behind the chairs in turn. Silent and discreet, she bent a vague, mild face upon them, as if to signify that, little as she, followed their doings, she wished them well; and she took from, each, across the table, in the common solemnity, an upward, recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving, out to the terrace, a few minutes later. Her father and her, husband, Mrs. Assingham and Charlotte, had done nothing but meet, her eyes; yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a, separate passage--which was all the more wonderful since, with, the secret behind every face, they had alike tried to look at her, THROUGH it and in denial of it.\\n\\nwound her, they had signalled from house to house their clever, idea, the idea by which, for all these days, her own idea had, been profiting. They had built her in with their purpose--which, was why, above her, a vault seemed more heavily to arch; so that, she sat there, in the solid chamber of her helplessness, as in a, bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her, over the brim of, which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck., Baths of benevolence were very well, but, at least, unless one, were a patient of some sort, a nervous eccentric or a lost child\\n\\nand as consciously to herself, as she might have backed away from, the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip; a truth that, contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant, danger of advertising her subtle processes. That Charlotte should, have begun to be restrictive about the Assinghams--which she had, never, and for a hundred obviously good reasons, been before--, this in itself was a fact of the highest value for Maggie, and of, a value enhanced by the silence in which Fanny herself so much, too unmistakably dressed it. What gave it quite thrillingly its, price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to, her stepmother more actively--if she was to back up her friends, for holding out--than she had ever yet been opposed; though of, course with the involved result of the fine chance given Mrs., Verver to ask her husband for explanations. Ah, from the moment, she should be definitely CAUGHT in opposition there would be, naturally no saying how much Charlotte's opportunities might, multiply! What would become of her father, she hauntedly asked\\n\\nThese shadows rose and fell for her while Father Mitchell, prattled; with other shadows as well, those that hung over, Charlotte herself, those that marked her as a prey to equal, suspicions--to the idea, in particular, of a change, such a, change as she didn't dare to face, in the relations of the two, men. Or there were yet other possibilities, as it seemed to, Maggie; there were always too many, and all of them things of, evil when one's nerves had at last done for one all that nerves, could do; had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was, like the predicament of the night-watcher in a beast-haunted land, who has no more means for a fire. She might, with such nerves\\n\\nsomehow, the truth--for she was believing herself in relation to, the truth!--at which she mustn't so much as indirectly point., Such, at any rate, was the fashion in which her passionate, prudence played over possibilities of danger, reading symptoms, and betrayals into everything she looked at, and yet having to, make it evident, while she recognised them, that she didn't, wince. There were moments between them, in their chairs, when he, might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of, something new that would trip her up. There were pauses during, which, with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine, she, might yet, as at some hard game, over a table, for money, have, been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication, of consciousness. She was positively proud, afterwards, of the, great style in which she had kept this up; later on, at the, hour's end, when they had retraced their steps to find Amerigo, and Charlotte awaiting them at the house, she was able to say to, herself that, truly, she had put her plan through; even though, once more setting herself the difficult task of making their, relation, every minute of the time, not fall below the standard, of that other hour, in the treasured past, which hung there, behind them like a framed picture in a museum, a high watermark, for the history of their old fortune; the summer evening, in the, park at Fawns, when, side by side under the trees just as now\\n\\nFanny Assingham was there to explain away--of this she was duly, conscious; for that at least had been true up to now. In the, light, however, of Maggie's demonstration the quantity, even, without her taking as yet a more exact measure, might well seem, larger than ever. Besides which, with or without exactness, the, effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more, in presence of what Maggie herself saw. Maggie herself saw the, truth, and that was really, while they remained there together\\n\\nthis purpose only, she brought her repeatedly back to the, subject, both in her husband's presence and during several scraps, of independent colloquy. Before her father, instinctively, Maggie, took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not, less than her own--allowing, that is, for everything his wife, would already have had to tell him, for such passages, between, them, as might have occurred since the evening before. Joining, them after luncheon, reaching them, in her desire to proceed with, the application of her idea, before they had quitted the, breakfast-room, the scene of their mid-day meal, she referred, in, her parent's presence, to what she might have lost by delay, and, expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left, for her to pick up. Charlotte was dressed to go out, and her, husband, it appeared, rather positively prepared not to; he had, left the table, but was seated near the fire with two or three of, the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts, on a stand beside him--more even than the usual extravagance, as, Maggie's glance made out, of circulars, catalogues\\n\\nat the American Embassy, with another and a larger party; so that, the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the, younger, under date of six o'clock, a telegram requesting her, immediate attendance. \\\"Please come to me at once; dress early, if, necessary, so that we shall have time: the carriage, ordered for, us, will take you back first.\\\" Mrs. Assingham, on quick, deliberation, dressed, though not perhaps with full lucidity, and, by seven o'clock was in Portland Place, where her friend\\n\\nvirtually, by enabling every one present--and oh Charlotte not, least!--to draw a long breath. The message of the little scene, had been different for each, but it had been this, markedly, all, round, that it reinforced--reinforced even immensely--the general, effort, carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more, successful, to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were, the matter. Supremely, however, while this glass was held up to, her, had Maggie's sense turned to the quality of the success, constituted, on the spot, for Charlotte. Most of all, if she was, guessing how her father must have secretly started, how her, husband must have secretly wondered, how Fanny Assingham must, have secretly, in a flash, seen daylight for herself--most of all, had she tasted, by communication, of the high profit involved for, her companion. She FELT, in all her pulses, Charlotte feel it\\n\\nhowever, as Maggie approached, dropping her gaze to the latter's, level long enough to seem to adventure, marvellously, on a mute, appeal. \\\"You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this, there would be no knowing what she might do?\\\" This light Mrs., Assingham richly launched while her younger friend, unresistingly, moved, became uncertain again, and then, not too much to show, it--or, rather, positively to conceal it, and to conceal, something more as well--turned short round to one of the windows, and awkwardly, pointlessly waited. \\\"The largest of the three, pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands, looped round, it, which, as you see, are the finest possible vieux Saxe, are, not of the same origin or period, or even, wonderful as they are\\n\\nshe somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that, would improve upon her own. They were in short not only, themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity, but were, somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her, Maggie, as, well. And she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time, longer when, one afternoon in Portland Place, she broke out with, an irrelevance that was merely superficial.\\n\\nMoving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow, of a false position, she reflected that she should either not, have ceased to be right--that is, to be confident--or have, recognised that she was wrong; though she tried to deal with, herself, for a space, only as a silken-coated spaniel who has, scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears., Her shake of her head, again and again, as she went, was much of, that order, and she had the resource, to which, save for the rude, equivalent of his generalising bark, the spaniel would have been, a stranger, of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had, happened to her. She had not, so to speak, fallen in; she had had, no accident and had not got wet; this at any rate was her, pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she, mightn't, with or without exposure, have taken cold. She could at, all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited, and, certainly none--which was another special point--that so brought, with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement. This, birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime, in her view\\n\\nshould she follow him, would overtake or meet her there. She, followed him of necessity--it came, absolutely, so near to his, inviting her, by stepping off into temporary detachment, to give, the others something of the chance that she and her husband had, so fantastically discussed. Beside him then, while they hung over, the great dull place, clear and almost coloured now, coloured, with the odd, sad, pictured, \\\"old-fashioned\\\" look that empty, London streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer's end\\n\\nAnd she made a point even, our young woman, of not turning away., Her grip of her shawl had loosened--she had let it fall behind, her; but she stood there for anything more and till the weight, should be lifted. With which she saw soon enough what more was to, come. She saw it in Charlotte's face, and felt it make between, them, in the air, a chill that completed the coldness of their, conscious perjury. \\\"Will you kiss me on it then?\\\"\\n\\nBut she brooded and brooded. \\\"I'm not sure even that the Prince, will.\\\" It seemed privation, in short, for them all. \\\"They'll be, mystified, confounded, tormented. But they won't know--and all, their possible putting their heads together won't make them., That,\\\" said Fanny Assingham, \\\"will be their punishment.\\\" And she, ended, ever, when she had come so far, at the same pitch. \\\"It, will probably also--if I get off with so little--be mine.\\\"\\n\\nCharlotte's one opportunity, meanwhile, for the air of confidence, she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm, and charming type, was the presence of visitors, never, as the, season advanced, wholly intermitted--rather, in fact, so, constant, with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for, tea and to see the house, now replete, now famous, that, Maggie grew to think again of this large element of \\\"company\\\" as, of a kind of renewed water-supply for the tank in which, like a, party of panting gold-fish, they kept afloat. It helped them\\n\\nthrough whatever he might say, she was still adhering. \\\"It's not, my having gone into the place, at the end of four years, that, makes the strangeness of the coincidence; for don't such chances, as that, in London, easily occur? The strangeness,\\\" she lucidly, said, \\\"is in what my purchase was to represent to me after I had, got it home; which value came,\\\" she explained, \\\"from the wonder, of my having found such a friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She positively believes then they're guilty? She has arrived at, that, she's really content with it, in the absence of proof?\\\", It was here, each time, that Fanny Assingham most faltered; but, always at last to get the matter, for her own sense, and with a, long sigh, sufficiently straight. \\\"It isn't a question of belief, or of proof, absent or present; it's inevitably, with her, a, question of natural perception, of insurmountable feeling. She, irresistibly knows that there's something between them. But she, hasn't 'arrived' at it, as you say, at all; that's exactly what, she hasn't done, what she so steadily and intensely refuses to, do. She stands off and off, so as not to arrive; she keeps out to, sea and away from the rocks, and what she most wants of me is to, keep at a safe distance with her--as I, for my own skin, only ask, not to come nearer.\\\" After which, invariably, she let him have it, all. \\\"So far from wanting proof--which she must get, in a manner\\n\\nexceptionally intelligent lamb. The positive effect of the, intensity of this figure, however, was to make her shake it away, in her resumed descent; and after she had rejoined him, after she, had picked him up, she was to know the full pang of the thought, that her impossibility was MADE, absolutely, by his, consciousness, by the lucidity of his intention: this she felt, while she smiled there for him, again, all hypocritically; while, she drew on fair, fresh gloves; while she interrupted the process, first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to, make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into, his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity.\\n\\nwordless smile, but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted, silken rope, and Maggie's translation of it, held in her breast, till she got well away, came out only, as if it might have been, overheard, when some door was closed behind her. \\\"Yes, you see--I, lead her now by the neck, I lead her to her doom, and she doesn't, so much as know what it is, though she has a fear in her heart, which, if you had the chances to apply your ear there that I, as, a husband, have, you would hear thump and thump and thump. She, thinks it MAY be, her doom, the awful place over there--awful for, HER; but she's afraid to ask, don't you see? just as she's afraid, of not asking; just as she's afraid of so many other things that, she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals., She'll know, however--when she does know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes--to give us a life.\\\" Maggie had gone through the form of, recalling this, and the light of their ancient candour, shining, from so far back, had seemed to bring out some things so, strangely that, with the sharpness of the vision, she had risen, to her feet. \\\"Well, with a 'life' Fawns will certainly do.\\\" He, had remained in his place while she looked over his head; the, picture, in her vision, had suddenly swarmed. The vibration was, that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which, with her, companion, she was travelling; but she was having to steady, herself, this time, before meeting his eyes. She had measured, indeed the full difference between the move to Fawns because each, of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing-off, for a, journey, of her husband and her father, which nobody knew that, either wanted. \\\"More company\\\" at Fawns would be effectually, enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at, work; there was truly no question but that she and her father, must accept any array of visitors. No one could try to marry him, now. What he had just said was a direct plea for that, and what, was the plea itself but an act of submission to Charlotte? He, had, from his chair, been noting her look, but he had, the next, minute, also risen, and then it was they had reminded each other, of their having come out for the boy. Their junction with him and, with his companion successfully effected, the four had moved home, more slowly, and still more vaguely; yet with a vagueness that, permitted of Maggie's reverting an instant to the larger issue.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that's not for me to imagine, and I should be very sorry to, have to try to say! I'm aware of no point whatever at which I may, have failed you,\\\" said Charlotte; \\\"nor of any at which I may have, failed any one in whom I can suppose you sufficiently interested, to care. If I've been guilty of some fault I've committed it all, unconsciously, and am only anxious to hear from you honestly, about it. But if I've been mistaken as to what I speak of--the, difference, more and more marked, as I've thought, in all your, manner to me--why, obviously, so much the better. No form of, correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction.\\\"\\n\\nWith which, his glasses still fixed on her, his hands in his, pockets, his hat pushed back, his legs a little apart, he seemed, to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had, occurred to him he might as well treat her to, in default of, other things, before they changed their subject. It had the, effect, for her, of a reminder--a reminder of all he was, of all, he had done, of all, above and beyond his being her perfect, little father, she might take him as representing, take him as, having, quite eminently, in the eyes of two hemispheres, been, capable of, and as therefore wishing, not--was it?--, illegitimately, to call her attention to. The \\\"successful,\\\", beneficent person, the beautiful, bountiful, original\\n\\n\\\"it's only I to whom, fantastically, it says so much. That's all, I mean, at any rate--that it's sort of soothing; as if we were, sitting about on divans, with pigtails, smoking opium and seeing, visions. 'Let us then be up and doing'--what is it Longfellow, says? That seems sometimes to ring out; like the police breaking, in--into our opium den--to give us a shake. But the beauty of it, is, at the same time, that we ARE doing; we're doing, that is\\n\\nnone the less, what happened; inasmuch as if our young woman had, been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm, at a stroke, it yet took her but an instant to sound, at any, risk, the note she had been privately practising. If she had, practised it the day before, at dinner, on Amerigo, she knew but, the better how to begin for it with Mrs. Verver, and it immensely, helped her, for that matter, to be able at once to speak of the, Prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her, curiosity. Frankly and gaily she had come to ask--to ask what, in, their unusually prolonged campaign, the two had achieved. She had, got out of her husband, she admitted, what she could, but, husbands were never the persons who answered such questions, ideally. He had only made her more curious, and she had arrived, early, this way, in order to miss as little as possible of, Charlotte's story.\\n\\nIf Maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say, either, to her good friend or to any one else, more than she meant about, her father, she might have found herself betrayed into some such, overflow during the week spent in London with her husband after, the others had adjourned to Fawns for the summer. This was, because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so, simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident, in their course of life hitherto. She was used, herself\\n\\n\\\"And what in the world, my dear, did you mean by it?\\\"--that, sound, as at the touch of a spring, rang out as the first effect, of Fanny's speech. It broke upon the two women's absorption with, a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal, for the, door of the room had been opened by the Prince without their, taking heed. He had apparently had time, moreover, to catch the, conclusion of Fanny's act; his eyes attached themselves, through, the large space allowing just there, as happened, a free view, to, the shining fragments at this lady's feet. His question had been, addressed to his wife, but he moved his eyes immediately, afterwards to those of her visitor, whose own then held them in a, manner of which neither party had been capable, doubtless, for, mute penetration, since the hour spent by him in Cadogan Place on, the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of Charlotte's, reappearance. Something now again became possible for these, communicants, under the intensity of their pressure, something, that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of, pledges then exchanged. This rapid play of suppressed appeal and, disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results, than one--long enough for Mrs. Assingham to measure the feat of, quick self-recovery, possibly therefore of recognition still more, immediate, accompanying Amerigo's vision and estimate of the, evidence with which she had been--so admirably, she felt as she, looked at him--inspired to deal. She looked at him and looked at, him--there were so many things she wanted, on the spot, to say., But Maggie was looking too--and was moreover looking at them, both; so that these things, for the elder woman, quickly enough, reduced themselves to one. She met his question--not too late\\n\\nBut it made no difference, know as she might what a past--still, so recent and yet so distant--it alluded to; she repeated her, denial, warning him off, on her side, from spoiling the truth of, her contention. \\\"I never went into anything, and you see I don't;, I've continued to adore you--but what's that, from a decent, daughter to such a father? what but a question of convenient, arrangement, our having two houses, three houses, instead of one, (you would have arranged for fifty if I had wished!) and my, making it easy for you to see the child? You don't claim, I, suppose, that my natural course, once you had set up for, yourself, would have been to ship you back to American City?\\\"\\n\\nso dishonestly come by, for which her companion's still, countenance, at the hour and afterwards, had consented to serve, as the deep soil, might have worked up again to the surface, to, be thrown back upon her hands. Yes, it was positive that during, one of these minutes the Princess had the vision of her, particular alarm. \\\"It's her lie, it's her lie that has mortally, disagreed with her; she can keep down no longer her rebellion at, it, and she has come to retract it, to disown it and denounce, it--to give me full in my face the truth instead.\\\" This, for a, concentrated instant, Maggie felt her helplessly gasp--but only, to let it bring home the indignity, the pity of her state. She, herself could but tentatively hover, place in view the book she, carried, look as little dangerous, look as abjectly mild, as, possible; remind herself really of people she had read about in, stories of the wild west, people who threw up their hands, on, certain occasions, as a sign they weren't carrying revolvers. She, could almost have smiled at last, troubled as she yet knew, herself, to show how richly she was harmless; she held up her, volume, which was so weak a weapon, and while she continued, for, consideration, to keep her distance, she explained with as, quenched a quaver as possible. \\\"I saw you come out--saw you from, my window, and couldn't bear to think you should find yourself, here without the beginning of your book. THIS is the beginning;, you've got the wrong volume, and I've brought you out the right.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood with his hands in his pockets; he had carried his eyes, to the fragments on the chimney-piece, and she could already, distinguish the element of relief, absolutely of succour, in his, acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of, their friend's violence--every added inch of reflection and delay, having the advantage, from this point on, of counting for him, double. It had operated within her now to the last intensity, her, glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him, helping, him to help himself, as it were, she should help him to help HER., Hadn't she fairly got into his labyrinth with him?--wasn't she, indeed in the very act of placing herself there, for him, at its, centre and core, whence, on that definite orientation and by an, instinct all her own, she might securely guide him out of it? She, offered him thus, assuredly, a kind of support that was not to, have been imagined in advance, and that moreover required--ah, most truly!--some close looking at before it could be believed in, and pronounced void of treachery. \\\"Yes, look, look,\\\" she seemed, to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other--, \\\"look, look, both at the truth that still survives in that, smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that, I'm not such a fool as you supposed me. Look at the possibility, that, since I AM different, there may still be something in it, for you--if you're capable of working with me to get that out., Consider of course, as you must, the question of what you may, have to surrender, on your side, what price you may have to pay\\n\\n\\\"Oh, how can I talk,\\\" she asked, \\\"of otherwise? It ISN'T, luckily, for me, otherwise. If everything were different\\\"--she further, presented her thought--\\\"of course everything WOULD be.\\\" And then, again, as if that were but half: \\\"My idea is this, that when you, only love a little you're naturally not jealous--or are only, jealous also a little, so that it doesn't matter. But when you, love in a deeper and intenser way, then you are, in the same, proportion, jealous; your jealousy has intensity and, no doubt\\n\\nthe still further light that Charlotte, for herself, knew as, little as he had known. The vision loomed, in this light, it, fairly glared, for the few seconds--the vision of the two others, alone together at Fawns, and Charlotte, as one of them, having, gropingly to go on, always not knowing and not knowing! The, picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour--, that of the so possible identity of her father's motive and, principle with her own. HE was \\\"deep,\\\" as Amerigo called it, so, that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter;, just as she had earned that description by making and by, for, that matter, intending still to make, her care for his serenity\\n\\nduring which her impression rose and rose, even as that of the, typical charmed gazer, in the still museum, before the named and, dated object, the pride of the catalogue, that time has polished, and consecrated. Extraordinary, in particular, was the number of, the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing. He, was strong--that was the great thing. He was sure--sure for, himself, always, whatever his idea: the expression of that in him, had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste, for the rare and the true. But what stood out beyond everything, was that he was always, marvellously, young--which couldn't but, crown, at this juncture, his whole appeal to her imagination., Before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that, he was simply a great and deep and high little man, and that to, love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished, a whit\\n\\nno never, should she have to explain to Fanny Assingham again--, who, poor woman, on her own side, would be charged, it might be, forever, with that privilege of the higher ingenuity. She put it, all off on Fanny, and the dear thing herself might henceforth, appraise the quantity. More and more magnificent now in her, blameless egoism, Maggie asked no questions of her, and thus only, signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her. She, didn't care for what devotions, what dinners of their own the, Assinghams might have been \\\"booked\\\"; that was a detail, and she, could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to, which her service condemned them. It all fell in beautifully\\n\\nonce more pushed the door open, she had practically a sense of, method and experience. What she should never know about, Charlotte's thought--she tossed THAT in. It would find itself in, company, and she might at last have been standing there long, enough to see it fall into its corner. The sight moreover would, doubtless have made her stare, had her attention been more free--, the sight of the mass of vain things, congruous, incongruous\\n\\nat your hour, for blight, why was I myself dealt with all for, deception? why condemned after a couple of short years to find, the golden flame--oh, the golden flame!--a mere handful of black, ashes?\\\" Our young woman so yielded, at moments, to what was, insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity, that for, minutes together, sometimes, the weight of a new duty seemed to, rest upon her--the duty of speaking before separation should, constitute its chasm, of pleading for some benefit that might be, carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of, the emigre, the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and, negotiable some day in the market of misery.\\n\\nhad taken her into his arms. The hesitation had been at the, first, and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without, her help. She had given him no help; for if, on the one hand, she, couldn't speak for hesitation, so on the other--and especially as, he didn't ask her--she couldn't explain why she was agitated. She, had known it all the while down to her toes, known it in his, presence with fresh intensity, and if he had uttered but a, question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness., It had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to, him should have had that appearance; but she was more than ever, conscious that any appearance she had would come round, more or, less straight, to her father, whose life was now so quiet, on the, basis accepted for it, that any alteration of his consciousness, even in the possible sense of enlivenment, would make their, precious equilibrium waver. THAT was at the bottom of her mind\\n\\nher adversary in things of this fineness--to see him at all, in, short, brave a name that would represent him as in opposition--, was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering, of her cry of alarm. Should he guess they were having, in their, so occult manner, a HIGH fight, and that it was she, all the, while, in her supposed stupidity, who had made it high and was, keeping it high--in the event of his doing this before they could, leave town she should verily be lost.\\n\\nuninterruptedly presented until they moved again, might have, represented the success with which she watched all her message, penetrate. They presently went back the way she had come, but she, stopped Maggie again within range of the smoking-room window and, made her stand where the party at cards would be before her. Side, by side, for three minutes, they fixed this picture of quiet, harmonies, the positive charm of it and, as might have been said\\n\\nShe went to her room, through the quiet house; she roamed there a, moment, picking up, pointlessly, a different fan, and then took, her way to the shaded apartments in which, at this hour, the, Principino would be enjoying his nap. She passed through the, first empty room, the day nursery, and paused at an open door., The inner room, large, dim and cool, was equally calm; her boy's, ample, antique, historical, royal crib, consecrated, reputedly\\n\\nno doubt, from its never having troubled him in other connexions., She had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to, show for what it was. She had not been unconscious, on the other, hand, that if it hadn't touched Amerigo so nearly he would have, found in it matter for some amused reflection. He had uttered an, extraordinary sound, something between a laugh and a howl, on her, saying, as she had made a point of doing: \\\"Oh, most certainly, he, TOLD me his reason was because he 'liked' me\\\"--though she, remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been, provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those, that, so pictured, she had had to endure. That the partner of her, bargain had yearned to see her again, that he had plainly jumped, at a pretext for it, this also she had frankly expressed herself, to the Prince as having, in no snubbing, no scandalised, but, rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit, not, delayed to make out. He had wished, ever so seriously, to return, her a part of her money, and she had wholly declined to receive, it; and then he had uttered his hope that she had not, at all, events, already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose, she had, so kindly and so fortunately, named to him. It wasn't a, thing for a present to a person she was fond of, for she wouldn't, wish to give a present that would bring ill luck. That had come, to him--so that he couldn't rest, and he should feel better now, that he had told her. His having led her to act in ignorance was, what he should have been ashamed of; and, if she would pardon\\n\\nyou see, of my feeling myself wronged. Their least danger, they, know, is in going on with all the things that I've seemed to, accept and that I've given no indication, at any moment, of not, accepting. Everything that has come up for them has come up, in, an extraordinary manner, without my having by a sound or a sign, given myself away--so that it's all as wonderful as you may, conceive. They move at any rate among the dangers I speak of--, between that of their doing too much and that of their not having, any longer the confidence, or the nerve, or whatever you may call, it, to do enough.\\\" Her tone, by this time, might have shown a, strangeness to match her smile; which was still more marked as, she wound up. \\\"And that's how I make them do what I like!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wives, papa,\\\" she said; \\\"are always much better reporters--, though I grant,\\\" she added for Charlotte, \\\"that fathers are not, much better than husbands. He never,\\\" she smiled, \\\"tells me more, than a tenth of what you tell him; so I hope you haven't told him, everything yet, since in that case I shall probably have lost the, best part of it.\\\" Maggie went, she went--she felt herself going;, she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part, and rehearsing it, but who suddenly, on the stage, before the, footlights, had begun to improvise, to speak lines not in the, text. It was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that, kept her up, made her rise higher: just as it was the sense of, action that logically involved some platform--action quite, positively for the first time in her life, or, counting in the, previous afternoon, for the second. The platform remained for, three or four days thus sensibly under her feet, and she had all, the while, with it, the inspiration of quite remarkably, of quite, heroically improvising. Preparation and practice had come but a, short way; her part opened out, and she invented from moment to, moment what to say and to do. She had but one rule of art--to, keep within bounds and not lose her head; certainly she might see, for a week how far that would take her. She said to herself, in, her excitement, that it was perfectly simple: to bring about a, difference, touch by touch, without letting either of the three\\n\\nMrs. Assingham thought. \\\"The more danger then of his coming in, and finding me here. I don't know, you see, what you now consider, that you've ascertained; nor anything of the connexion with it of, that object that you declare so damning.\\\" Her eyes rested on this, odd acquisition and then quitted it, went back to it and again, turned from it: it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance\\n\\ncertainly, do nothing to make easy. She felt with her sharpest, thrill how he was straitened and tied, and with the miserable, pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could, none the less perfectly accord. To name her father, on any such, basis of anxiety, of compunction, would be to do the impossible, thing, to do neither more nor less than give Charlotte away., Visibly, palpably, traceably, he stood off from this, moved, back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived, but, which had been, between the two, with so much, so strangely much, else, quite uncalculated. Verily it towered before her, this, history of their confidence. They had built strong and piled, high--based as it was on such appearances--their conviction that\\n\\neverything, had restored them to the serenity of a relation, without a cloud. It had been, in short, in this light, ideally, conclusive, so that no ghost of anything it referred to could, ever walk again. What was the ecstasy of that, however, but in, itself a trifle compromising?--as truly, within the week, Maggie, had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning, and rather, abruptly, to remember. Convinced as she was of the example, already given her by her husband, and in relation to which her, profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity, exquisitely calculated, her imagination yet sought in the hidden, play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface\\n\\ndiffering always for a different interpreter. As she herself had, hovered in sight of it a quarter-of-an-hour before, it would have, been a thing for her to show Charlotte--to show in righteous, irony, in reproach too stern for anything but silence. But now it, was she who was being shown it, and shown it by Charlotte, and, she saw quickly enough that, as Charlotte showed it, so she must, at present submissively seem to take it.\\n\\nagain, to-night, after her start was taken; went, positively, as, she had felt herself going, three weeks before, on the morning, when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together, in the breakfast-room had been so determinant. In this other, scene it was Lady Castledean who was determinant, who kindled the, light, or at all events the heat, and who acted on the nerves;, Lady Castledean whom she knew she, so oddly, didn't like, in, spite of reasons upon reasons, the biggest diamonds on the, yellowest hair, the longest lashes on the prettiest, falsest, eyes, the oldest lace on the most violet velvet, the rightest, manner on the wrongest assumption. Her ladyship's assumption was, that she kept, at every moment of her life, every advantage--it, made her beautifully soft, very nearly generous; so she didn't, distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social, insects, often endowed with such a range, from the other, decorative spots on their bodies and wings. Maggie had liked, in, London, and in the world at large, so many more people than she, had thought it right to fear, right even to so much as judge\\n\\nBut she had her hours, thus, of feeling supremely linked to him, by the rigour of their law, and when it came over her that, all, the while, the wish, on his side, to spare her might be what most, worked with him, this very fact of their seeming to have nothing, \\\"inward\\\" really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of, sweetness that was wanting, as a consecration, even in her, yearning for her husband. She was powerless, however, was only, more utterly hushed, when the interrupting flash came, when she, would have been all ready to say to him, \\\"Yes, this is by every, appearance the best time we've had yet; but don't you see, all, the same, how they must be working together for it, and how my, very success, my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a, new basis, comes round to being their success, above all; their, cleverness, their amiability, their power to hold out, their, complete possession, in short, of our life?\\\" For how could she, say as much as that without saying a great deal more? without, saying \\\"They'll do everything in the world that suits us, save, only one thing--prescribe a line for us that will make them, separate.\\\" How could she so much as imagine herself even faintly, murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that, would have made her quail? \\\"Separate, my dear? Do you want them, to separate? Then you want US to--you and me? For how can the one, separation take place without the other?\\\" That was the question, that, in spirit, she had heard him ask--with its dread train\\n\\nfor the lingering moment, almost with a terror of her endless, power of surrender. He had only to press, really, for her to, yield inch by inch, and she fairly knew at present, while she, looked at him through her cloud, that the confession of this, precious secret sat there for him to pluck. The sensation, for, the few seconds, was extraordinary; her weakness, her desire, so, long as she was yet not saving herself, flowered in her face like, a light or a darkness. She sought for some word that would cover, this up; she reverted to the question of tea, speaking as if they, shouldn't meet sooner. \\\"Then about five. I count on you.\\\"\\n\\nHe faced her awhile longer in the same way; it was, strangely, as, if, by this sudden arrest, by their having, in their acceptance, of the unsaid, or at least their reference to it, practically, given up pretending--it was as if they were \\\"in\\\" for it, for, something they had been ineffably avoiding, but the dread of, which was itself, in a manner, a seduction, just as any, confession of the dread was by so much an allusion. Then she, seemed to see him let himself go. \\\"When a person's of the nature, you speak of there are always other persons to suffer. But you've, just been describing to me what you'd take, if you had once a, good chance, from your husband.\\\"\\n\\nAnd yet another of these concomitants of feverish success, all, the while, was the perception that in another quarter too things, were being made easy. Charlotte's alacrity in meeting her had, in, one sense, operated slightly overmuch as an intervention: it had, begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband's showing, her that, to be all there, as the phrase was, he likewise only, required--as one of the other phrases was too--the straight tip., She had heard him talk about the straight tip, in his moods of, amusement at English slang, in his remarkable displays of, assimilative power, power worthy of better causes and higher, inspirations; and he had taken it from her, at need, in a way, that, certainly in the first glow of relief, had made her brief, interval seem large. Then, however, immediately, and even though, superficially, there had declared itself a readjustment of, relations to which she was, once more, practically a little, sacrificed. \\\"I must do everything,\\\" she had said, \\\"without, letting papa see what I do--at least till it's done!\\\" but she, scarce knew how she proposed, even for the next few days, to, blind or beguile this participant in her life. What had in fact, promptly enough happened, she presently recognised, was that if, her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her, and if, she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her, husband's side, so, on the other hand, this had, with as little, delay, entailed some very charming assistance for her in Eaton, Square. When she went home with Charlotte, from whatever happy, demonstration, for the benefit of the world in which they, supposed themselves to live, that there was no smallest reason, why their closer association shouldn't be public and acclaimed--, at these times she regularly found that Amerigo had come either, to sit with his father-in-law in the absence of the ladies, or to, make, on his side, precisely some such display of the easy, working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of, her excursions with Charlotte. Under this particular impression, it was that everything in Maggie most melted and went to pieces--, every thing, that is, that belonged to her disposition to, challenge the perfection of their common state. It divided them, again, that was true, this particular turn of the tide--cut them, up afresh into pairs and parties; quite as if a sense for the, equilibrium was what, between them all, had most power of, insistence; quite as if Amerigo himself were all the while, at, bottom, equally thinking of it and watching it. But, as against, that, he was making her father not miss her, and he could have, rendered neither of them a more excellent service. He was acting, in short on a cue, the cue given him by observation; it had been, enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour; his, instinct for relations, the most exquisite conceivable, prompted, him immediately to meet and match the difference, to play somehow, into its hands. That was what it was, she renewedly felt, to have, married a man who was, sublimely, a gentleman; so that, in spite, of her not wanting to translate ALL their delicacies into the, grossness of discussion, she yet found again and again, in, Portland Place, moments for saying: \\\"If I didn't love you, you, know, for yourself, I should still love you for HIM.\\\" He looked, at her, after such speeches, as Charlotte looked, in Eaton, Square, when she called HER attention to his benevolence: through, the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her, extravagance, harmless though it might be, as a tendency to, reckon with. \\\"But my poor child,\\\" Charlotte might under this, pressure have been on the point of replying, \\\"that's the way nice, people ARE, all round--so that why should one be surprised about, it? We're all nice together--as why shouldn't we be? If we hadn't, been we wouldn't have gone far--and I consider that we've gone, very far indeed. Why should you 'take on' as if you weren't a, perfect dear yourself, capable of all the sweetest things?--as if, you hadn't in fact grown up in an atmosphere, the atmosphere of, all the good things that I recognised, even of old, as soon as I, came near you, and that you've allowed me now, between you, to, make so blessedly my own.\\\" Mrs. Verver might in fact have but, just failed to make another point, a point charmingly natural to, her as a grateful and irreproachable wife. \\\"It isn't a bit, wonderful, I may also remind you, that your husband should find\\n\\nAfter the little party was again constituted at Fawns--which had, taken, for completeness, some ten days--Maggie naturally felt, herself still more possessed, in spirit, of everything that had, last happened in London. There was a phrase that came back to her, from old American years: she was having, by that idiom, the time, of her life--she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of, possession, which was almost too violent either to recognise or, to hide. It was as if she had come out--that was her most general, consciousness; out of a dark tunnel, a dense wood, or even simply, a smoky room, and had thereby, at least, for going on, the, advantage of air in her lungs. It was as if she were somehow at, last gathering in the fruits of patience; she had either been, really more patient than she had known at the time, or had been, so for longer: the change brought about by itself as great a, difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a, telescope. It was her telescope in fact that had gained in, range--just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the, observation by the more charmed, and therefore the more reckless\\n\\nassented in secret despair, perhaps even in secret irritation, to, her being ridiculous?--so that the best now possible was to, wonder, once in a great while, whether one mightn't give her the, surprise of something a little less out of the true note than, usual. Something of this kind was the question that Maggie, while, the absentees still delayed, asked of the appearance she was, endeavouring to present; but with the result, repeatedly again\\n\\nHer friend took it, for a minute, however, by carrying thoughtful, eyes, eyes verily portentous, over her head. \\\"You say you've no, one to speak to, and you make a point of your having so disguised, your feelings--not having, as you call it, given yourself away., Have you then never seen it not only as your right, but as your, bounden duty, worked up to such a pitch, to speak to your, husband?\\\"\\n\\nand Maggie, as having known delusion--rather!--understood the, nature of cages. She walked round Charlotte's--cautiously and in, a very wide circle; and when, inevitably, they had to communicate, she felt herself, comparatively, outside, on the breast of, nature, and saw her companion's face as that of a prisoner, looking through bars. So it was that through bars, bars richly, gilt, but firmly, though discreetly, planted, Charlotte finally, struck her as making a grim attempt; from which, at first, the, Princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage, had suddenly been opened from within.\\n\\nIt provided for an evening--this had been Maggie's view; and she, lived up to her view, in her friend's eyes, by treating the, occasion, more or less explicitly, as new and strange. The good, Assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale, so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that, it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home, how, they met, themselves, the question of giving to eat. Maggie dined, with them, in short, and arrived at making her husband appear to, dine, much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have\\n\\nprecisely, to show what wonder she could work under pressure. Her, friend felt--how could she not?--as the truly pious priest might, feel when confronted, behind the altar, before the festa, with, his miraculous Madonna. Such an occasion would be grave, in, general, with all the gravity of what he might look for. But the, gravity to-night would be of the rarest; what he might look for, would depend so on what he could give.\\n\\ncontinue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve, glimmered, suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer, for, meeting her, a new basis and something like a new system., Maggie felt, truly, a rare contraction of the heart on making, out, the next instant, what the new system would probably have to, be--and she had practically done that before perceiving that the, thing she feared had already taken place. Charlotte, extending, her search, appeared now to define herself vaguely in the, distance; of this, after an instant, the Princess was sure\\n\\nafter all, she said to herself, was a renewal for him of the, privilege of watching that lady watch her. Very well, then: with, the elements after all so mixed in him, how long would he go on, enjoying mere spectatorship of that act? For she had by this time, made up her mind that in Charlotte's company he deferred to, Charlotte's easier art of mounting guard. Wouldn't he get tired--, to put it only at that--of seeing her always on the rampart\\n\\nto let her keep her head. She might have been losing her head, verily in her husband's eyes--since he didn't know, all the, while, that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted, intensity of her disposition personally to seize him. He didn't, know, either, that this was her manner--now she was with him--of, beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense. For the people, of the French Revolution, assuredly, there wasn't suspense; the, scaffold, for those she was thinking of, was certain--whereas, what Charlotte's telegram announced was, short of some, incalculable error, clear liberation. Just the point, however\\n\\nshe felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been, to them, how it would have torn them to pieces, if they had so, much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their, eyes. This danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be, reckoned with if the instinct of each--she could certainly at, least answer for her own--had not so successfully acted to trump, up other apparent connexions for it, connexions as to which they, could pretend to be frank.\\n\\npositively, moments of planned postponement, of evasion scarcely, less disguised than studied, during which she turned over with, anxiety the different ways--there being two or three possible, ones--in which her young stepmother might, at need, seek to work, upon her. Amerigo's not having \\\"told\\\" her of his passage with his, wife gave, for Maggie, altogether a new aspect to Charlotte's, consciousness and condition--an aspect with which, for, apprehension, for wonder, and even, at moments, inconsequently, enough, for something like compassion, the Princess had now to, reckon. She asked herself--for she was capable of that--what he, had MEANT by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a, matter touching her otherwise so nearly; what he had meant, that, is, for this unmistakably mystified personage herself. Maggie, could imagine what he had meant for her--all sorts of thinkable, things, whether things of mere \\\"form\\\" or things of sincerity\\n\\nHer best comprehension of Amerigo's success in not committing, himself was in her recall, meanwhile, of the inquiries he had, made of her on their only return to the subject, and which he had, in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make. He had, had it over with her again, the so distinctly remarkable incident, of her interview at home with the little Bloomsbury shopman. This, anecdote, for him, had, not altogether surprisingly, required, some straighter telling, and the Prince's attitude in presence of, it had represented once more his nearest approach to a, cross-examination. The difficulty in respect to the little man, had been for the question of his motive--his motive in writing\\n\\nthis snatched communion yet lifted Maggie as on air--so much, for, deep guesses on her own side too, it gave her to think of. There, was, honestly, an awful mixture in things, and it was not closed, to her aftersense of such passages--we have already indeed, in, other cases, seen it open--that the deepest depth of all, in a, perceived penalty, was that you couldn't be sure some of your, compunctions and contortions wouldn't show for ridiculous., Amerigo, that morning, for instance, had been as absent as he at, this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as, being; he had gone to London for the day and the night--a, necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more, than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests\\n\\nfiguratively speaking, and of prolongations of tension, round, about him, mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin, to virtue. Some day in some happier season, she would confess to, him that she hadn't confessed, though taking so much on her, conscience; but just now she was carrying in her weak, stiffened, hand a glass filled to the brim, as to which she had recorded a, vow that no drop should overflow. She feared the very breath of a, better wisdom, the jostle of the higher light, of heavenly help, itself; and, in addition, however that might be, she drew breath, this afternoon, as never yet, in an element heavy to oppression., Something grave had happened, somehow and somewhere, and she had\\n\\nand yet, from the moment one had thus appraised it, vivid and, definite in its domination of the scene. Fanny could no more, overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted, Christmas-tree; but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her, mind for some floating reminiscence of it. At the same time that, this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal, she even, not a little shared the Prince's mystic apprehension. The golden, bowl put on, under consideration, a sturdy, a conscious, perversity; as a \\\"document,\\\" somehow, it was ugly, though it, might have a decorative grace. \\\"His finding me here in presence, of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable--for all of us--than, you intend or than would necessarily help us. And I must take, time, truly, to understand what it means.\\\"\\n\\nthat their situation couldn't be bettered; and he even went at no, moment through the form of replying that, should their ordeal, strike her as exceeding their patience, any step they might take, would be for her own relief. This was, no doubt, partly because, he stood out so wonderfully, to the end, against admitting, by a, weak word at least, that any element of their existence WAS, or, ever had been, an ordeal; no trap of circumstance, no lapse of, \\\"form,\\\" no accident of irritation, had landed him in that, inconsequence. His wife might verily have suggested that he was, consequent--consequent with the admirable appearance he had from, the first so undertaken, and so continued, to present--rather too, rigidly at HER expense; only, as it happened, she was not the, little person to do anything of the sort, and the strange tacit, compact actually in operation between them might have been, founded on an intelligent comparison, a definite collation, positively, of the kinds of patience proper to each. She was, seeing him through--he had engaged to come out at the right end, if she WOULD see him: this understanding, tacitly renewed from, week to week, had fairly received, with the procession of the, weeks, the consecration of time; but it scarce needed to be, insisted on that she was seeing him on HIS terms, not all on, hers, or that, in other words, she must allow him his unexplained, and uncharted, his one practicably workable way. If that way, by, one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far, from having even yet completely fallen from him, happened, handsomely to show him as more bored than boring (with advantages, of his own freely to surrender, but none to be persuadedly, indebted to others for,) what did such a false face of the matter, represent but the fact itself that she was pledged? If she had, questioned or challenged or interfered--if she had reserved, herself that right--she wouldn't have been pledged; whereas there, were still, and evidently would be yet a while, long, tense, stretches during which their case might have been hanging, for, every eye, on her possible, her impossible defection. She must, keep it up to the last, mustn't absent herself for three minutes, from her post: only on those lines, assuredly, would she show, herself as with him and not against him.\\n\\nunder the action of Charlotte's presence, than the fact of a felt, sincerity in her words. She felt her sincerity absolutely sound--, she gave it for all it might mean. \\\"Because Charlotte, dear, you, know,\\\" she said, \\\"is incomparable.\\\" It took thirty seconds, but, she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one, of the happiest words of her life. They had turned from the view, of the street; they leaned together against the balcony rail\\n\\nunmistakably, had come up for her that had never come up before;, it represented a new complication and had begotten a new, anxiety--things, these, that she carried about with her done up, in the napkin of her lover's accepted rebuke, while she vainly, hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down. The, disguised solemnity, the prolonged futility of her search might, have been grotesque to a more ironic eye; but Maggie's provision, of irony, which we have taken for naturally small, had never been, so scant as now, and there were moments while she watched with, her, thus unseen, when the mere effect of being near her was to, feel her own heart in her throat, was to be almost moved to, saying to her: \\\"Hold on tight, my poor dear--without TOO MUCH, terror--and it will all come out somehow.\\\"\\n\\nthe least bit \\\"good,\\\" that he wouldn't already, long ago, in his, rummagings, have seen himself--and only not to think a quarter, good enough; this, however, was an old story, and one could not, have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the, individual gift, the friendship's offering, was, by a rigorous, law of nature, a foredoomed aberration, and that the more it was, so the more it showed, and the more one cherished it for showing\\n\\nhow friendly it had been. The infirmity of art was the candour of, affection, the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy;, the ugliest objects, in fact, as a general thing, were the, bravest, the tenderest mementos, and, as such, figured in glass, cases apart, worthy doubtless of the home, but not worthy of the, temple--dedicated to the grimacing, not to the clear-faced, gods., She herself, naturally, through the past years, had come to be, much represented in those receptacles; against the thick, locked, panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose, finding in, its place, each time, everything she had on successive, anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend, at her, suggestion, to be put off with, or at least think curious. She, was now ready to try it again: they had always, with his pleasure, in her pretence and her pleasure in his, with the funny betrayal, of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side, played the, game so happily. To this end, on her way home, she had loitered, everywhere; quite too deludedly among the old books and the old, prints, which had yielded nothing to her purpose, but with a, strange inconsequence in one of the other shops, that of a small, antiquarian, a queer little foreign man, who had shown her a, number of things, shown her finally something that, struck with, it as rather a rarity and thinking it would, compared to some of, her ventures, quite superlatively do, she had bought--bought, really, when it came to that, for a price. \\\"It appears now it, won't do at all,\\\" said Maggie, \\\"something has happened since that, puts it quite out of the question. I had only my day of, satisfaction in it, but I feel, at the same time, as I keep it, here before me, that I wouldn't have missed it for the world.\\\"\\n\\nand least of all her father, so much as suspect her hand. If they, should suspect they would want a reason, and the humiliating, truth was that she wasn't ready with a reason--not, that is, with, what she would have called a reasonable one. She thought of, herself, instinctively, beautifully, as having dealt, all her, life, at her father's side and by his example, only in reasonable, reasons; and what she would really have been most ashamed of, would be to produce for HIM, in this line, some inferior, substitute. Unless she were in a position to plead, definitely\\n\\nfor her minute, wittingly exposed; but she saw it as quickly, cease to threaten--quite saw the Princess, even though in all her, pain, refuse, in the interest of their strange and exalted, bargain, to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the, stab of reproach, the opportunity thus coming all of itself. She, saw her--or she believed she saw her--look at her chance for, straight denunciation, look at it and then pass it by; and she, felt herself, with this fact, hushed well-nigh to awe at the, lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that, no discovery--since it was, however obscurely, a case of, \\\"discovery\\\"--could make less needful. These seconds were brief--, they rapidly passed; but they lasted long enough to renew our, friend's sense of her own extraordinary undertaking, the function, again imposed on her, the answerability again drilled into her\\n\\nsurprisingly, to be connected; conviction, that is, budged no, inch, only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil--but, action began to hover like some lighter and larger, but easier, form, excited by its very power to keep above ground. It would be, free, it would be independent, it would go in--wouldn't it?--for, some prodigious and superior adventure of its own. What would, condemn it, so to speak, to the responsibility of freedom--this, glimmered on Maggie even now--was the possibility, richer with, every lapsing moment, that her husband would have, on the whole, question, a new need of her, a need which was in fact being born, between them in these very seconds. It struck her truly as so new, that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all;, would indeed, absolutely, by this circumstance, be REALLY needing, her for the first one in their whole connection. No, he had used, her, had even exceedingly enjoyed her, before this; but there had, been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him, which she was rapidly taking on. The immense advantage of this, particular clue, moreover, was that she should have now to, arrange, alter, to falsify nothing; should have to be but, consistently simple and straight. She asked herself, with, concentration, while her back was still presented, what would be, the very ideal of that method; after which, the next instant, it, had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the, application. \\\"Fanny Assingham broke it--knowing it had a crack, and that it would go if she used sufficient force. She thought\\n\\nmy dear, if you come to that, is the matter with YOU?\\\" When, a, minute later on, he had followed up his last note by a touch or, two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the, anomalous, at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to, the question. \\\"There seems a kind of charm, doesn't there? on our, life--and quite as if, just lately, it had got itself somehow, renewed, had waked up refreshed. A kind of wicked selfish, prosperity perhaps, as if we had grabbed everything, fixed, everything, down to the last lovely object for the last glass, case of the last corner, left over, of my old show. That's the, only take-off, that it has made us perhaps lazy, a wee bit, languid--lying like gods together, all careless of mankind.\\\"\\n\\nAmerigo, meanwhile, after all, could clearly make the most of her, having enjoined on him to wait--suggested it by the positive pomp, of her dealings with the smashed cup; to wait, that is, till she, should pronounce as Mrs. Assingham had promised for her. This, delay, again, certainly tested her presence of mind--though that, strain was not what presently made her speak. Keep her eyes, for, the time, from her husband's as she might, she soon found herself, much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit. There, was even a minute, when her back was turned to him, during which, she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him, a, strangeness that had already, fifty times, brushed her, in the, depth of her trouble, as with the wild wing of some bird of the, air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft, of a well, darkening there by his momentary flutter the far-off, round of sky. It was extraordinary, this quality in the taste of, her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to, soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more, she had to recognise it; for what it came to was that seeing, herself finally sure, knowing everything, having the fact, in all, its abomination, so utterly before her that there was nothing, else to add--what it came to was that, merely by being WITH him, there in silence, she felt, within her, the sudden split between, conviction and action. They had begun to cease, on the spot\\n\\nThey went in to receive the boy, upon whose introduction to the, room by Miss Bogle Charlotte and the Prince got up--seemingly, with an impressiveness that had caused Miss Bogle not to give, further effect to her own entrance. She had retired, but the, Principino's presence, by itself, sufficiently broke the, tension--the subsidence of which, in the great room, ten minutes, later, gave to the air something of the quality produced by the, cessation of a sustained rattle. Stillness, when the Prince and, Princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage\\n\\nA few days of this, accordingly, had wrought a change in that, apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph--of triumph, magnanimous and serene--with which the upshot of the night-scene, on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms. She, had had, as we know, her vision of the gilt bars bent, of the, door of the cage forced open from within and the creature, imprisoned roaming at large--a movement, on the creature's part\\n\\nin all probability, primarily, to conjure away any such, appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his, father-in-law might notice and follow up. It would have been open, to him however, given the pitch of their intimacy, to avert this, danger by some more conceivable course with Charlotte; since an, earnest warning, in fact, the full freedom of alarm, that of his, insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred, and on the, importance accordingly of outward peace at any price, would have, been the course really most conceivable. Instead of warning and, advising he had reassured and deceived her; so that our young, woman, who had been, from far back, by the habit, if her nature\\n\\nreduced to looking vaguely about at the sky, could only feel her, not fail of her purpose. \\\"The air's heavy as if with thunder--I, think there'll be a storm.\\\" She made the suggestion to carry off, an awkwardness--which was a part, always, of her companion's, gain; but the awkwardness didn't diminish in the silence that, followed. Charlotte had said nothing in reply; her brow was dark, as with a fixed expression, and her high elegance, her handsome, head and long, straight neck testified, through the dusk, to, their inveterate completeness and noble erectness. It was as if, what she had come out to do had already begun, and when, as a, consequence, Maggie had said helplessly, \\\"Don't you want, something? won't you have my shawl?\\\" everything might have, crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute. Mrs., Verver's rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they, hadn't closed in for idle words, just as her dim, serious face\\n\\nthe quantity of change in their state. Well then, that other, sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble;, with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward, refreshment. They HAD, after all, whatever happened, always and, ever each other; each other--that was the hidden treasure and the, saving truth--to do exactly what they would with: a provision, full of possibilities. Who could tell, as yet, what, thanks to, it, they wouldn't have done before the end?\\n\\nher appreciation of his taste, her native passion for beautiful, objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could, teach her about them. Maggie had in due course seen her begin, to \\\"work\\\" this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it, was worth. She took possession of the mound throughout its, extent; she abounded, to odd excess, one might have remarked, in, the assumption of its being for her, with her husband, ALL the, ground, the finest, clearest air and most breathable medium, common to them. It had been given to Maggie to wonder if she, didn't, in these intensities of approbation, too much shut him up, to his province; but this was a complaint he had never made his, daughter, and Charlotte must at least have had for her that\\n\\nshe could talk so of their \\\"time\\\"--she was somehow sustained; she, was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present, possession of her ground. \\\"They have their reasons--many things, to think of; how can one tell? But there's always, also, the, chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours, together; I mean that he and I shall. He may wish to take me off, to dine with him somewhere alone--and to do it in memory of old, days. I mean,\\\" the Princess went on, \\\"the real old days; before, my grand husband was invented and, much more, before his grand, wife was: the wonderful times of his first great interest in what, he has since done, his first great plans and opportunities\\n\\nLeft with her husband, Maggie, however, for the time, said, nothing; she only felt, on the spot, a strong, sharp wish not to, see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange, it. She had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her, next movement--seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise, that followed his entrance. Then it was that she knew how hugely, expert she had been made, for judging it quickly, by that vision, of it, indelibly registered for reference, that had flashed a, light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from, Matcham. The expression worn by it at that juncture, for however, few instants, had given her a sense of its possibilities, one of, the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her\\n\\nCharlotte had brought this out with the richness, almost, of, gaiety;  and Maggie, to go on, had to think, with her own, intensity, of Amerigo--to think how he, on his side, had had to, go through with his lie to her, how it was for his wife he had, done so, and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her, the example. He must have had his own difficulty about it, and, she was not, after all, falling below him. It was in fact as if\\n\\nfrom catching at him as, in the other time, with the superficial, impetus he and Charlotte had privately conspired to impart, she, had so often, her breath failing her, known the impulse to catch, at her father? She did, however, just yet, nothing inconsequent--, though she couldn't immediately have said what saved her; and by, the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing, something merely needful. \\\"I wanted you simply to know--so that, you mayn't by accident miss them. For it's the last,\\\" said, Maggie.\\n\\nThe sharp, successful, almost primitive wail in it made Charlotte, turn, and this movement attested for the Princess the felicity of, her deceit. Something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the, night she stood in the drawing-room and denied that she had, suffered. She was ready to lie again if her companion would but, give her the opening. Then she should know she had done all., Charlotte looked at her hard, as if to compare her face with her, note of resentment; and Maggie, feeling this, met it with the, signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of, defeat. \\\"I want really to possess him,\\\" said Mrs. Verver. \\\"I, happen also to feel that he's worth it.\\\"\\n\\nprecisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the, thing born out of sight. The ingenuity was thus a private and, absorbing exercise, in the light of which, might I so far, multiply my metaphors, I should compare her to the frightened but, clinging young mother of an unlawful child. The idea that had, possession of her would be, by our new analogy, the proof of her, misadventure, but likewise, all the while, only another sign of a, relation that was more to her than anything on earth. She had, lived long enough to make out for herself that any deep-seated, passion has its pangs as well as its joys, and that we are made, by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it. She, had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to, her husband; but to become aware, almost suddenly, that it had, begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a, strain would, rightly looked at, after all but show that she was\\n\\nThe point of view--that one--was what she read in their free, contemplation, in that of the whole eight; there was something in, Amerigo to be explained, and she was passed about, all tenderly, and expertly, like a dressed doll held, in the right manner, by, its firmly-stuffed middle, for the account she could give. She, might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach; she, might have been expected to articulate, with a rare imitation of, nature, \\\"Oh yes, I'm HERE all the while; I'm also in my way a, solid little fact and I cost originally a great deal of money:, cost, that is, my father, for my outfit, and let in my husband, for an amount of pains--toward my training--that money would, scarce represent.\\\" Well, she WOULD meet them in some such way\\n\\nfrom the other house to their own, when he had tried to charm, her, by his sovereign personal power, into some collapse that, would commit her to a repudiation of consistency. She was never, alone with him, it was to be said, without her having sooner or, later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency;, yet, at the same time, so long as she breathed no charge, she, kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from, attack. Attack, real attack, from him, as he would conduct it, was what she above all dreaded; she was so far from sure that, under that experience she mightn't drop into some depth of, weakness, mightn't show him some shortest way with her that he, would know how to use again. Therefore, since she had given him\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" Maggie went on while the footman came back to let them, out. \\\"I see,\\\" she said again; though she felt a little, disconcerted. What she really saw, of a sudden, was that her, stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the, proposal, and this brought her back her need that her father, shouldn't think her concerned in any degree for anything. She, alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat; her, husband, to let her out, had passed before her, and, a little in, advance, he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace, a step, high, that preceded their open entrance, on either side of which, one of their servants stood. The sense of a life tremendously, ordered and fixed rose before her, and there was something in, Amerigo's very face, while his eyes again met her own through the, dusky lamplight, that was like a conscious reminder of it. He, had answered her, just before, distinctly, and it appeared to, leave her nothing to say. It was almost as if, having planned for, the last word, she saw him himself enjoying it. It was almost as, if--in the strangest way in the world--he were paying her back\\n\\n\\\"The consciousness\\\"--she had never lost her promptness--\\\"of, having no stones to throw at any one else's windows. She has, enough to do to guard her own glass. That was what she was, doing,\\\" Fanny said, \\\"that last morning at Matcham when all of us, went off and she kept the Prince and Charlotte over. She helped, them simply that she might herself be helped--if it wasn't, perhaps, rather, with her ridiculous Mr. Blint, that HE might be., They put in together, therefore, of course, that day; they got it, clear--and quite under her eyes; inasmuch as they didn't become, traceable again, as we know, till late in the evening.\\\" On this, historic circumstance Mrs. Assingham was always ready afresh to, brood; but she was no less ready, after her brooding, devoutly to, add \\\"Only we know nothing whatever else--for which all our stars, be thanked!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but naturally!\\\" On which, as the warranted truth of it hung, in the air--the truth warranted, as who should say, exactly by, the present opportunity to pronounce, this opportunity created, and accepted--she found herself lost, though with a finer thrill, than she had perhaps yet known, in the vision of all he might, mean. The sense of it in her rose higher, rose with each moment, that he invited her thus to see him linger; and when, after a, little more, he had said, smoking again and looking up, with head, thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail, at the grey\\n\\nto dispense so unwontedly--as their life had recently come to be, arranged--with his wife's attendance. It had so happened that she, herself was, for the hour, exempt from her husband's, and it will, at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when I, note that, remembering how the Prince had looked in to say he was, going out, the Princess whimsically wondered if their respective, sposi mightn't frankly be meeting, whimsically hoped indeed they, were temporarily so disposed of. Strange was her need, at, moments, to think of them as not attaching an excessive, importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had, rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness., Repudiations, surely, were not in the air--they had none of them, come to that; for wasn't she at this minute testifying directly, against them by her own behaviour? When she should confess to, fear of being alone with her father, to fear of what he might, then--ah, with such a slow, painful motion as she had a horror, of!--say to her, THEN would be time enough for Amerigo and, Charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather.\\n\\nIt now appeared, none the less, that some renewed conversation, with Mr. Crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly, and, Maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own, to, the success of which she designed to devote her morning. Visits, of gracious ladies, under his protection, lighted up rosily, for, this perhaps most flower-loving and honey-sipping member of the, great Bloomsbury hive, its packed passages and cells; and though, not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found, herself, according to her appeal to him, yearning again, nothing, was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding, urbanities. So it had been settled, Maggie said to Mrs., Assingham, and she was to dispense with Amerigo's company. Fanny, was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last, fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman's detachment\\n\\nmagnificently handsome and supremely distinguished--they might, have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was, the author; they might even, for the happy appearance they, continued to present, have been such figures as would, by the, strong note of character in each, fill any author with the, certitude of success, especially of their own histrionic. They, might in short have represented any mystery they would; the point, being predominantly that the key to the mystery, the key that, could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring, was there, in her pocket--or rather, no doubt, clasped at this crisis in her, hand and pressed, as she walked back and forth, to her breast., She walked to the end and far out of the light; she returned and, saw the others still where she had left them; she passed round, the house and looked into the drawing-room, lighted also, but, empty now, and seeming to speak the more, in its own voice, of, all the possibilities she controlled. Spacious and splendid, like, a stage again awaiting a drama, it was a scene she might people\\n\\nfor herself, so suddenly and violently received. She had done her, best, even while taking it full in the face, not to give herself, away; but she wouldn't answer--no, she wouldn't--for what she, might, in her agitation, have made her informant think. He might, think what he would--there had been three or four minutes during, which, while she asked him question upon question, she had, doubtless too little cared. And he had spoken, for his, remembrance, as fully as she could have wished; he had spoken\\n\\nthe rages of jealousy, the protests of passion, as for something, she had been cheated of not least: a range of feelings which for, many women would have meant so much, but which for HER husband's, wife, for HER father's daughter, figured nothing nearer to, experience than a wild eastern caravan, looming into view with, crude colours in the sun, fierce pipes in the air, high spears, against the sky, all a thrill, a natural joy to mingle with, but, turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other, defiles. She saw at all events why horror itself had almost, failed her; the horror that, foreshadowed in advance, would, by, her thought, have made everything that was unaccustomed in her, cry out with pain; the horror of finding evil seated, all at its, ease, where she had only dreamed of good; the horror of the thing, HIDEOUSLY behind, behind so much trusted, so much pretended\\n\\nwhich was arranged. Her thought, over this, arrived at a great, intensity--had indeed its pauses and timidities, but always to, take afterwards a further and lighter spring. The ground was, well-nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and, his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of, movement. Policy or no policy, it was they themselves who were, arranged. She must be kept in position so as not to DISarrange, them. It fitted immensely together, the whole thing, as soon as, she could give them a motive; for, strangely as it had by this, time begun to appear to herself, she had hitherto not imagined, them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her, own. Of course they were arranged--all four arranged; but what, had the basis of their life been, precisely, but that they were, arranged together? Amerigo and Charlotte were arranged together\\n\\nprecisely, in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the, conditions of the simpler time, into a queer resemblance between, the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless, other moments that were sufficiently far away. She had been quick, in her preparation, in spite of the flow of the tide that, sometimes took away her breath; but a pause, once more, was still, left for her to make, a pause, at the top of the stairs, before, she came down to him, in the span of which she asked herself if, it weren't thinkable, from the perfectly practical point of view\\n\\nwhile they were alone, before she had rung for a servant, he had, renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity, such as, it was, on which she had ventured. They had risen together to, come upstairs; he had been talking at the last about some of the, people, at the very last of all about Lady Castledean and Mr., Blint; after which she had once more broken ground on the matter, of the \\\"type\\\" of Gloucester. It brought her, as he came round the, table to join her, yet another of his kind conscious stares, one, of the looks, visibly beguiled, but at the same time not, invisibly puzzled, with which he had already shown his sense of, this charming grace of her curiosity. It was as if he might for a, moment be going to say:--\\\"You needn't PRETEND, dearest, quite so, hard, needn't think it necessary to care quite so much!\\\"--it was, as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence\\n\\nthat their equilibrium was everything, and that it was, practically precarious, a matter of a hair's breadth for the loss, of the balance. It was the equilibrium, or at all events her, conscious fear about it, that had brought her heart into her, mouth; and the same fear was, on either side, in the silent look, she and Amerigo had exchanged. The happy balance that demanded, this amount of consideration was truly thus, as by its own, confession, a delicate matter; but that her husband had also HIS, habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them, after, all, more closely together. It would have been most beautifully\",\n          \"How the remainder of that Jacksonian ticket was elected, down to the very, hog-reeves, and amid what turmoil of the Democracy and bitterness of, spirit of the orthodox, I need not recount. There is no moral to the, story, alas--it was one of those things which inscrutable heaven, permitted to be done. After that dark town-meeting day some of those, stern old fathers became broken men, and it is said in Coniston that this, calamity to righteous government, and not the storm, gave to Priest Ware, his death-stroke.\\n\\nA week passed, and Jethro did not appear in the village, report having it, that he was cutting his farms on Thousand Acre Hill. When Jethro was, farming,--so it was said,--he would not stop to talk politics even with, the President of the United States were that dignitary to lean over his, pasture fence and beckon to him. On a sultry Friday morning, when William, Wetherell was seated at Jonah Winch's desk in the cool recesses of the, store slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome accounts which, seemed hopeless, he was thrown into a panic by the sight of one staring, at him from the far side of a counter. History sometimes reverses itself.\\n\\nMassachusetts, deals in all kinds of seeds? Ellett--that's it. Wrote to, Ellet, said I had a hundred bushels of Red Brooks to sell, as fine a, lookin' potato as I had in my cellar. Made up my mind to take what he, offered, if it was only five cents. He wrote back a dollar a bushel. I-I, was always satisfied with my Red Brook Seedlings, Sam. But I never raised, any more--n-never raised any more.\\\"\\n\\nThe notes are mine, not Moses's. Strange that they didn't occur to Moses., What a wealthy man has our hero become at thirty-one! Jethro Bass was, rich beyond the dreams of avarice--for Coniston. Truth compels me to, admit that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine, thousand \\\"dollars\\\"; but that was a large sum of money for Coniston in, those days, and even now. Nathan Bass had been a saving man, and had left, to his son one-half of this fortune. If thrift and the ability to gain, wealth be qualities for a hero, Jethro had them--in those days.\\n\\nEven as Isaac D. Worthington did not dream of the Truro Railroad and of, an era in the haze of futurity, it did not occur to Jethro Bass that his, ambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand. Makers of, eras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate matters to, worry about history. Jethro never heard the expression about \\\"cracks in, the Constitution,\\\" and would not have known what it meant,--he merely had, the desire to get on top. But with Established Church Coniston tight in, the saddle (in the person of Moses Hatch, Senior), how was he to do it?\\n\\nTo return to the book. As long as he lived, Jethro looked back to the joy, of the monumental task of mastering its contents. In his mind, Napoleon, became a rough Yankee general; of the cities, villages, and fortress he, formed as accurate a picture as a resident of Venice from Marco Polo's, account of Tartary. Jethro had learned to read, after a fashion, to, write, add, multiply, and divide. He knew that George Washington and, certain barefooted companions had forced a proud Britain to her knees\\n\\nWith these words of brotherly advice Mr. Bass went off down the road, and, Mr. Price chopped no more wood that night; but repeated to himself many, times in his nasal voice, \\\"I want to know!\\\" In the course of the next few, weeks various gentlemen mentioned to Mr. Price that he had been spoken of, for Moderator, and he became acquainted with the names of the other, candidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned. Whereupon he, girded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of Jacksonian, Democracy in all the farmhouses roundabout, with such effect that Samuel, Todd and others were able to talk with some fluency about the rights of, American citizens.\\n\\nIsaac Worthington came to Coniston not once, but many times, before the, snow fell; and afterward, too, in Silas Wheelock's yellow sleigh through, the great drifts under the pines, the chestnut Morgan trotting to one, side in the tracks. On one of these excursions he fell in with that, singular character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first, visit, in coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens. Jethro Bass was plodding, in the same direction, and Isaac Worthington, out of the goodness of his, heart, invited him into the sleigh. He was scarcely prepared for the, bumpkin's curt refusal, but put it down to native boorishness, and, thought no more about it then.\\n\\nAt noon, on one of those madcap April days of that Coniston country, Jock, descended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly figure of, Jethro Bass coming toward him across the green. Jethro was about thirty, years of age, and he wore a coonskin cap even in those days, and trousers, tacked into his boots. He carried his big head bent forward, a little to, one aide, and was not, at first sight, a prepossessing-looking person. As, our story largely concerns him and we must get started somehow, it may as, well be to fix a little attention on him.\\n\\n\\\"Jock, you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church,\\\", said Cynthia, as she walked away. The young Moses referred to was Moses, Hatch, Junior, son of the pillar of the Church and State, and it was an, open secret that he was madly in love with Cynthia. Let it be said of him, that he was a steady-going young man, and that he sighed for the moon.\\n\\nBut so it came to pass, she was taken from him, who had been the one joy, and inspiration of his weary days, and he was driven, wandering, into, unfrequented streets that he might not recall, the places where she had, once trod, and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted him,--its, laughter, its sweet notes of seriousness; little ways and manners of her, look came to twist his heart, and he prayed God to take him, too, until, it seemed that Cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness. One mild Sunday, afternoon, he took little Cynthia by the hand and led her, toddling, out, into the sunny Common, where he used to walk with her mother, and the, infant prattle seemed to bring--at last a strange peace to his, storm-tossed soul.\\n\\nand she walked out under the maples of the village street. Let it be, understood that Coniston was a village, by courtesy, and its shaded road, a street. Suddenly, there was the tannery, Jethro standing in front of, it, contemplative. Did he see her? Would he come to her? Cynthia, seized, by a panic of shame, flew into Aunt Lucy Prescott's, sat through half an, hour of torture while Aunt Lucy talked of redemption of sinners, during, ten minutes of which Jethro stood, still contemplative. What tumult was, in his breast, or whether there was any tumult, Cynthia knew not. He went, into the tannery again, and though she saw him twice later in the week\\n\\nJake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road, and pointed to the low, gable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the, meeting-house. The visitor gave a short glance at it, swung around and, gave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction., He did not suspect that Jake was what is now called a news agency. Then, Mr. Worthington turned to Jethro, who was stooping over the bark.\\n\\nCuriosity as a factor has never, perhaps, been given its proper weight by, philosophers. Besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal, as an, instigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men and, women, and made and marred careers. And curiosity now laid hold of, Cynthia Ware. Why in the world she should ever have been curious about, Jethro Bass is a mystery to many, for the two of them were as far apart, as the poles. Cynthia, of all people, took to watching the tanner's son\\n\\nLyman did it; not, perhaps, without cursing and grumbling. Lyman was a, profane and wicked man--drover, farmer, trader, anything. He had a cider, mill on his farm on the south slopes of Coniston which Mr. Ware had, mentioned in his sermons, and which was the resort of the ungodly. The, cider was not so good as Squire Northcutt's, but cheaper. Jethro was not, afraid of Lyman, and he had a mortgage on the six-horse team, and on the, farm and the cider mill.\\n\\nJethro was content to wait. That is a clew to his character throughout, his life. He would wait for his love, he would wait for his hate: he had, waited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little, scheme which he had been gradually developing during that time, for which, he had been amassing money, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, by the, way, had given him some valuable ideas. Jethro, as well as Isaac D., Worthington, had ambitions, although no one in Coniston had hitherto, guessed them except Jock Hallowell--and Cynthia Ware, after her curiosity, had been aroused.\\n\\nThat journey to Coniston was full of wonder to Cynthia, and of wonder and, sadness to Wetherell, for it was the way his other Cynthia had come to, Boston. From the state capital the railroad followed the same deep valley, as the old coach road, but ended at Truro, and then they took stage over, Truro Pass for Brampton, where honest Ephraim awaited them and their, slender luggage with a team. Brampton, with its wide-shadowed green, and, terrace-steepled church; home once of the Social Library and Lucretia, Penniman, now famous; home now of Isaac Dudley Worthington, whose great, mills the stage driver had pointed out to them on Coniston Water as they, entered the town.\\n\\nWe shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more, those, stanch old deacons and selectmen, who did their duty by their, fellow-citizens as they saw it and took no man's bidding. They could not, see the trackless roads over the hills, now becoming tracked, and the, bent figures driving doggedly against the storm, each impelled by a, motive: each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become, imperative. Some, like Eben Williams behind his rickety horse, came, through fear; others through ambition; others were actuated by both; and, still others were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater, jealousy and envy, and the remembrance of those who had been in power. I, must not omit the conscientious Jacksonians who were misguided enough to, believe in such a ticket.\\n\\nLet us call, next, Mr. Eben Williams, if we can. Moses Hatch, Senior, has, already interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the, church, for Mr. Williams is orthodox, though the deacons have to remind, him of his duty once in a while. Eben is timid, and replies to us, as to, Moses, that he has heard of the Democratic ticket, and callates that, Fletcher Bartlett, who has always been the leader of the Democratic, party, has named the ticket. He did not mention Jethro Bass to Deacon, Hatch. Why should he? What has Jethro Bass got to do with politics?\\n\\n\\\"Then he will go,\\\" said Cynthia, so quietly that he gave her another, look, strange and tender and comprehending. He, sat and talked of many, things: of the great war that was agonizing the nation; of the strong man, who, harassed and suffering himself, was striving to guide it, likening, Lincoln unto a physician. So the doctor was wont to take the minds of, patients from themselves. And before he left he gave poor Wetherell a, fortnight to decide.\\n\\nThere was a young man in Boston, when Jethro arrived in Lyman Hull's, team, named William Wetherell. By extraordinary circumstances he and, another connected with him are to take no small part in this story, which, is a sufficient excuse for his introduction. His father had been a, prosperous Portsmouth merchant in the West India trade, a man of many, attainments, who had failed and died of a broken heart; and William, at, two and twenty, was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of Mr. Judson in, Cornhill.\\n\\nJethro Bass--Eben testifies to us--is in the habit of visiting him once a, month, perhaps, when he goes to Amos Cuthbert's. Just friendly calls. Is, it not a fact that Jethro Bass holds his mortgage? Yes, for eight hundred, dollars. How long has he held that mortgage? About a year and a half. Has, the interest been paid promptly? Well, the fact is that Eben hasn't paid, any interest yet.\\n\\nIn spite of herself, Cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in, the builder's voice. Now that she thought of it, there was rugged power, in Jethro's face, especially when he took off the coonskin cap. She, always nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the, road, and sometimes he nodded back, but oftener he had not appeared to, see her. She had thought this failure to nod stupidity, but it might, after all be abstraction.\\n\\nI am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of, fiction,--this is a true chronicle, and they stayed apart most of that, winter. Jethro went about his daily tasks, which were now become, manifold, and he wore the locket on its little chain himself. He did not, think that Cynthia loved him--yet, but he had the effrontery to believe, that she might, some day; and he was content to wait. He saw that she, avoided him, and he was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur, ridicule and contempt.\\n\\nCynthia kept her eyes on her plate, but she felt as though her body were, afire. Little did the minister imagine, as he went off to write his, sermon, that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery., Yes, Cynthia guessed; and she could not read that evening because of the, tumult of her thoughts. What was her duty in the matter? To tell her, father her suspicions? They were only suspicions, after all, and she, could make no accusations. And Jethro! Although she condemned him, there, was something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible, sense of humor. Cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice, and knew, that it was wicked. She excused Jethro, and told herself that, with his, lack of training, he could know no better. Then an idea came to her, and, the very boldness of it made her grow hot again. She would appeal to him, tell him that that power he had over other men could be put to better and, finer uses. She would appeal to him, and he would abandon the matter., That the man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she was sure\\n\\nYoung Mr. Worthington, instead of being justly indignant, laughed and, settled himself comfortably on a pile of bark. He thought Jethro a, character, and he was not mistaken. On the other hand, Mr. Worthington, displayed a knowledge of the falling-mill and splitting-machine and the, process of tanneries in general that was surprising. Jethro, had Mr., Worthington but known it, was more interested in animate machines: more, interested in Mr. Worthington than the falling-mill or, indeed, the, tannery business.\\n\\nAt last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of Coniston itself., There was the flagpole and the triangular green, scene of many a muster;, Jonah Winch's store, with its horse block and checker-paned windows, just, as Jonah had left it; Nathan Bass's tannery shed, now weather-stained and, neglected, for Jethro lived on Thousand Acre Hill now; the Prescott, house, home of the Stark hero, where Ephraim lived, \\\"innocent of paint\\\", (as one of Coniston's sons has put it), \\\"innocent of paint as a Coniston, maiden's face\\\"; the white meeting-house, where Priest Ware had, preached--and the parsonage. Cynthia and Wetherell loitered in front of, it, while the blue shadow of the mountain deepened into night, until Mr., Satterlee, the minister, found them there, and they went in and stood, reverently in the little chamber on the right of the door, which had been, Cynthia's.\\n\\nTo this day the railroad has not reached Coniston Village--nay, nor, Coniston Flat, four miles nearer Brampton. The village lies on its own, little shelf under the forest-clad slope of the mountain, and in the, midst of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used to, drill on June days. At one end of the triangle is the great pine mast, that graced no frigate of George's, but flew the stars and stripes on, many a liberty day. Across the road is Jonah Winch's store, with a, platform so high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it;, with its checker-paned windows, with its dark interior smelling of coffee, and apples and molasses, yes, and of Endea rum--for this was before the, days of the revivals.\\n\\nThree mornings later, a little after seven o'clock, when the storekeeper, and his small daughter were preparing to go to Brampton upon a very, troublesome errand, Chester Perkins appeared again. It is always easy to, stir up dissatisfaction among the ne'er-do-wells (Jethro had once done it, himself), and during the three days which had elapsed since Chester had, flung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright treason, heard in the store. William Wetherell, who had perplexities of his own\\n\\nThe hills seem to leap up against the sky as I describe that region where, Cynthia Ware was born, and the very old country names help to summon up, the picture. Coniston Mountain, called by some the Blue Mountain, clad in, Hercynian forests, ten good miles in length, north and south, with its, notch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers of it. Coniston, Water, that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred places, on the, eastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite\\n\\nThe next day is Sunday, and there is mild excitement in Coniston. For, Jethro Bass, still with the coonskin cap, but in a brass-buttoned coat, secretly purchased in Brampton, appeared at meeting! It made no, difference that he entered quietly, and sat in the rear slip, orthodox, Coniston knew that he was behind them: good Mr. Ware knew it, and changed, a little his prayers and sermon: Cynthia knew it, grew hot and cold by, turns under her poke bonnet. Was he not her brand, and would she not get, the credit of snatching him? How willingly, then, would she have given up, that credit to the many who coveted it--if it were a credit. Was Jethro, at meeting for any religious purpose?\\n\\nLet us pursue this matter a little farther, and form a committee of, investigation. Where did Mr. Todd learn anything about Jacksonian, principles? From Mr. Samuel Price, whom they have spoken of for, Moderator. And where did Mr. Price learn of these principles? Any one in, Coniston will tell you that Mr. Price makes a specialty of orators and, oratory; and will hold forth at the drop of a hat in Jonah Winch's store, or anywhere else. Who is Mr. Price? He is a tall, sallow young man of, eight and twenty, with a wedge-shaped face, a bachelor and a Methodist\\n\\nwho now drove the Brampton stage, brought the goods to the door. Little, Rias Richardson was willing to come in, and help move the barrels, and on, such occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes. William still had, time for his books; in that Coniston air he began to feel stronger, and, to wonder whether he might not be a Washington Irving yet. And yet he had, one worry and one fear, and both of these concerned one man,--Jethro, Bass. Him, by her own confession, Cynthia Ware had loved to her dying, day, hating herself for it: and he, William Wetherell, had married this, woman whom Jethro had loved so violently, and must always love--so, Wetherell thought: that was the worry. How would Jethro treat him? that, was the fear. William Wetherell was not the most courageous man in the, world.\\n\\nAnother Saturday came, and no Cynthia went to Brampton. Jethro may or may, not have been on the road. Sunday, and there was Jethro on the back seat, in the meetinghouse: Sunday noon, over his frugal dinner, the minister, mildly remonstrates with Cynthia for neglecting one who has shown signs, of grace, citing certain failures of others of his congregation: Cynthia, turns scarlet, leaving the minister puzzled and a little uneasy: Monday\\n\\nBefore he went to bed Jake Wheeler had written a letter which he sent off, to the state capital by the stage the next morning. In it he indicted no, less than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and he also thought, it wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby, a lieutenant in that, section, to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his well-known, methods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic. Such was, Jake's ordinary procedure when the bombs were fired, for Mr. Wheeler was, nothing if not cautious.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Listy, they call her. Nobody ever knew how he come to marry her., Jethro went up to Wisdom once, in the centre of the state, and come back, with her. Funny place to bring a wife from--Wisdom! Funnier place to, bring Listy from. He loads her down with them ribbons and gewgaws--all, the shades of the rainbow! Says he wants her to be the best-dressed woman, in the state. Callate she is,\\\" added Moses, with conviction. \\\"Listy's a, fine woman, but all she knows is enough to say, 'Yes, Jethro,' and 'No\\n\\npointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies, which she had, made herself. Impelled by a strange curiosity, William Wetherell went to, the door and watched them. There was a look on the face of Jethro Bass, that was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the wondrous, things around them that summer's day,--the flowers and the bees and the, brook (they must go down and stand on the brink of it), and the songs of, the vireo and the hermit thrush.\\n\\nHe caught her, struggling wildly, terror-stricken, in his arms, beat down, her hands, flung back her hood, and kissed her forehead--her hair, blown, by the wind--her lips. In that moment she felt the mystery of heaven and, hell, of all kinds of power. In that moment she was like a seed flying in, the storm above the mountain spruces whither, she knew not, cared not., There was one thought that drifted across the chaos like a blue light of, the spirit: Could she control the storm? Could she say whither the winds, might blow, where the seed might be planted? Then she found herself, listening, struggling no longer, for he held her powerless. Strangest of, all, most hopeful of all, his own mind was working, though his soul, rocked with passion.\\n\\nJethro Bass had not been in Coniston since William's arrival. No need to, ask where he was. Jake Wheeler, Jethro's lieutenant in Coniston, gave, William a glowing account of that Throne Room in the Pelican Hotel at the, capital, from whence Jethro ruled the state during the sessions of the, General Court. This legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory, committee of three hundred and fifty: an expensive advisory committee to, the people, relic of an obsolete form of government. Many stories of the, now all-powerful Jethro William heard from the little coterie which made, their headquarters in his store--stories of how those methods of which we, have read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties. Not, that Jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties, but the local, lieutenants did, and bowed to him as an overlord. There were funny, stories, and grim stories of vengeance which William Wetherell heard and, trembled at. Might not Jethro wish to take vengeance upon him?\\n\\nHow those checker-paned windows bring back the picture of that village, green! The meeting-house has them, lantern-like, wide and high, in three, sashes--white meeting-house, seat alike of government and religion, with, its terraced steeple, with its classic porches north and south. Behind it, is the long shed, and in front, rising out of the milkweed and the, flowering thistle, the horse block of the first meeting-house, where many, a pillion has left its burden in times bygone. Honest Jock Hallowell, built that second meeting-house--was, indeed, still building it at the, time of which we write. He had hewn every beam and king post in it, and, set every plate and slip. And Jock Hallowell is the man who, unwittingly, starts this chronicle.\\n\\nAs for Cynthia, nothing was farther from her mind. Unchristian as was the, thought, if this thing she had awakened could only have been put back to, sleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would she have, been happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than, sincerity, he received the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days, she welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston\\n\\nFor many years these Sunday walks in the Common were Wetherell's greatest, pleasure and solace, and it seemed as though little Cynthia had come into, the world with an instinct, as it were, of her mission that lent to her, infant words a sweet gravity and weight. Many people used to stop and, speak to the child, among them a great physician whom they grew to know., He was, there every Sunday, and at length it came to be a habit with him, to sit down on the bench and take Cynthia on his knee, and his stern face, would soften as he talked to her.\\n\\nIn front of the minister's barn under the elms on the hill Cynthia pulled, the harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened activity, of mind. She was not one who shrank from self-knowledge, and the question, put itself to her, \\\"Whither was this matter tending?\\\" The fire that is in, strong men has ever been a lure to women; and many, meaning to play with, it, have been burnt thereby since the world began. But to turn the fire., to some use, to make the world better for it or stranger for it, that, were an achievement indeed! The horse munching his hay, Cynthia lingered, as the light fainted above the ridge, with the thought that this might be, woman's province, and Miss Lucretia Penniman might go on leading her, women regiments to no avail. Nevertheless she was angry with Jethro, not, because of what he had said, but because of what he was.\\n\\nCynthia stared at him, perhaps with a new interest at this plodding, determination. She was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking to, him a third time in these woods, especially if the subject of, conversation were not, as Coniston thought, the salvation of his soul., But she stayed. Here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known, rules, who did not even deign to notice a week of marked coldness.\\n\\nHe sat behind a table covered with green leather, on which papers were, laid with elaborate neatness, and he wore a double-breasted skirted coat, of black, with braided lapels, a dark purple blanket cravat with a large, red cameo pin. And Mr. Worthington's features harmonized perfectly with, this costume--those of a successful, ambitious man who followed custom, and convention blindly; clean-shaven, save for reddish chops, blue eyes, of extreme keenness, and thin-upped mouth which had been tightening year, by year as the output of the Worthington Minx increased.\\n\\nSergeant Ephraim had much to say about the great war, and about Coniston., True to the instincts of the blood of the Stark hero, he had left the, plough and the furrow' at the first call, forty years of age though he, was. But it had been otherwise with many in Coniston and Brampton and, Harwich. Some of these, when the drafting came, had fled in bands to the, mountain and defied capture. Mr. Dudley Worthington, now a mill owner\\n\\nMay came, and the pools dried up, the orchards were pink and white, the, birches and the maples were all yellow-green on the mountain sides, against the dark pines, and Cynthia was driving the minister's gig to, Brampton. Ahead of her, in the canon made by the road between the great, woods, strode an uncouth but powerful figure--coonskin cap, homespun, breeches tucked into boots, and all. The gig slowed down, and Cynthia, began to tremble with that same delightful fear. She knew it must be, wicked, because she liked it so much. Unaccountable thing! She felt all, akin to the nature about her, and her blood was coursing as the sap, rushes through a tree. She would not speak to him; of that she was sure\\n\\nOne evening, the summer after their marriage, they were walking in the, Mall under the great elms that border the Common on the Tremont Street, side. They often used to wander there, talking of the books he was to, write when strength should come and a little leisure, and sometimes their, glances would linger longingly on Colonnade Row that Bulfinch built, across the way, where dwelt the rich and powerful of the city--and yet he, would not have exchanged their lot for his. Could he have earned with his, own hands such a house, and sit Cynthia there in glory, what happiness!, But, I stray.\\n\\n\\\"H-how much for that?\\\" he said, pointing to another. The clerk told him., He inquired about them all, deliberately repeating the sums, considering, with so well-feigned an air of a purchaser that Mr. Wetherell began to, take a real joy in the situation. For trade was slack in August, and, diversion scarce. Finally he commanded that the case be put on the top of, the counter, and Wetherell humored him. Whereupon he picked up the locket, he had first chosen. It looked very delicate in his huge, rough hand, and, Wetherell was surprised that the eyes of Mr. Bass had been caught by the, most expensive, for it was far from being the showiest.\\n\\nWetherell choked. The man outside shook the door again, and people on the, sidewalk stopped, and presently against the window panes a sea of curious, faces gazed in upon them. Mr. Bass's thoughts apparently were fixed on, Eternity--he looked neither at the people nor at Wetherell. And then, the, crowd parting as for one in authority, as in a bad dream the clerk saw, his employer, Mr. Judson, courteously pushing away the customer at the, door who would not be denied. Another moment, and Mr. Judson had gained, admittance with his private key, and stood on the threshold staring at, clerk and customer. Jethro gave no sign that the situation had changed.\\n\\nHe did not speak, but dropped his hands to his sides. His thoughts were, not to be fathomed, yet Cynthia took the movement for silent, confession,--which it was not, and stood appalled at the very magnitude, of his accomplishment, astonished at the secrecy he had maintained. She, had heard that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house of, Moses Hatch as having taken part in the matter, and she guessed something, of certain of his methods. But she had felt his force, and knew that this, was not the only secret of his power.\\n\\nBy all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing., They sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step, and, there discussed Cynthia's tastes. She was too old for dolls, Jethro, supposed. Yes, Cynthia was too old for dolls. She did not say so, but the, only doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of such, a reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon her., Books, suggested Jethro. Books she had known from her earliest infancy:, they had been piled around that bedroom over the roof. Books and book, lore and the command of the English tongue were William Wetherell's only, legacies to his daughter, and many an evening that spring she had read, him to sleep from classic volumes of prose and poetry I hesitate to name\\n\\n\\\"Great!\\\" Ephraim ejaculated. \\\"Guess he's the biggest man in the state, to-day. Queer how he got his power began twenty-four years ago when I, wahn't but twenty. I call that town meetin' to mind as if 'twas yesterday, never was such an upset. Jethro's be'n first Selectman ever sense, though, he turned Republican in '60. Old folks don't fancy Jethro's kind of, politics much, but times change. Jethro saved my life, I guess.\\\"\\n\\nThe summer flew on apace, for Coniston. Fragrant hay was cut on hillsides, won from rock and forest, and Coniston Water sang a gentler melody--save, when the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain and the rain, beat on the shingles. During the still days before the turn of the, year,--days of bending fruit boughs, crab-apples glistening red in the, soft sunlight,--rumor came from Brampton to wrinkle the forehead of Moses, Hatch as he worked among his father's orchards.\\n\\nThe sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day. Jethro's barn, and tannery were full, and many other barns in the village. And now the, peace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past. Deacon Lysander, Richardson, the moderator, sits aghast in his high place as they come, trooping in, men who have not been to town meeting for ten years. Deacon, Lysander, with his white band of whiskers that goes around his neck like, a sixteenth-century ruff under his chin, will soon be a memory. Now, enters one, if Deacon Lysander had known it symbolic of the new Era. One, who, though his large head is bent, towers over most of the men who make, way for him in the aisle, nodding but not speaking, and takes his place, in the chair under the platform on the right of the meeting-pause under, one of the high, three-part windows. That chair was always his in future, years, and there he sat afterward, silent, apparently taking no part. But, not a man dropped a ballot into the box whom Jethro Bass did not see and, mark.\\n\\nOne evening a fortnight later, while the lieutenant was holding forth in, commendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless if, not wholly admiring audience, a bomb burst in their midst. William, Wetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb, like those flung at, regular intervals from the Union mortars into Vicksburg. These bombs, at, any rate, never failed to cause consternation and fright in Coniston\\n\\nThe sun had dropped behind the mountain, leaving Coniston in amethystine, shadow, and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in, front of Aunt Lucy Prescott's window, before Cynthia returned. Aunt Lucy, was Cynthia's grandmother, and eighty-nine years of age. Still she sat in, her window beside the lilac bush, lost in memories of a stout, rosy lass, who had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the wilderness, some seventy years agone in Indian days--Weathersfield Massacre days., That lass was Aunt Lucy herself, and in just such a May had Timothy's axe, rung through the Coniston forest and reared the log cabin, where six of, her children were born. Likewise in review passed the lonely months when, Timothy was fighting behind his rugged General Stark for that privilege, more desirable to his kind than life--self government. Timothy Prescott, would pull the forelock to no man, would have such God-fearing persons as, he chose make his laws for him.\\n\\nPriest Ware ended a life of faithful service. The high pulpit, taken from, the old meeting house, and the cricket on which he used to stand and the, Bible from which he used to preach have remained objects of veneration in, Coniston to this day. A fortnight later many tearful faces gazed after, the Truro coach as it galloped out of Brampton in a cloud of dust, and, one there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill, who saw, within it a girl dressed in black, dry-eyed, staring from the window.\\n\\nThere is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than Brampton Street on, a summer's day. Down the length of it runs a wide green, shaded by, spreading trees, and on either side, tree-shaded, too, and each in its, own little plot, gabled houses of that simple, graceful architecture of, our forefathers. Some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices, the, envy of many a modern architect, and fan-shaped windows in dormer and, doorway. And there was the church, then new, that still stands to the, glory of its builders; with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the, widest of checker-paned sashes to let in the light on high-backed pews, and gallery.\\n\\nAs he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly, to solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country, a, visitor was climbing the last steep flight of stairs. That visitor was, none other than Sergeant Ephraim Prescott, son of Isaiah of the, pitch-pipe, and own cousin of Cynthia Ware's. Sergeant Ephraim was just, home from the war and still clad in blue, and he walked with a slight, limp by reason of a bullet he had got in the Wilderness, and he had such, an honest, genial face that little Cynthia was on his knee in a moment.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose the humblest of God's critturs has their uses,\\\" Moses remarked, contemplatively, as he watched the retreating figures of Sam and Jake., \\\"Leastwise that's Jethro's philosophy. When you come to know him, you'll, notice how much those fellers walk like him. Never seed a man who had so, many imitators. Some of,'em's took to talkie' like him, even to, stutterin'. Bijah Bixby, over to Clovelly, comes pretty nigh it, too.\\\"\\n\\nand much of the warring in the book took color from Captain Timothy, Prescott's stories of General Stark and his campaigns, heard at Jonah, Winch's store. What Paris looked like, or Berlin, or the Hospice of St., Bernard--though imaged by a winter Coniston--troubled Jethro not at all;, the thing that stuck in his mind was that Napoleon--for a considerable, time, at least--compelled men to do his bidding. Constitutions crumble, before the Strong. Not that Jethro philosophized about constitutions., Existing conditions presented themselves, and it occurred to him that, there were crevices in the town system, and ways into power through the, crevices for men clever enough to find them.\\n\\nNo wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the, honored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the perquisite of the church in, Coniston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered, it as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom, there were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that, morning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away, the breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated, for town office. Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on, the steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the sky., He had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely making, five out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass had for, some years been journeying through the town, baying his hides and wool\\n\\nFor some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard, the query ringing, in his head: Why had Jethro Bass bought that note? Did he think that the, storekeeper at Coniston would be of use to him, politically? The words, Chester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as he, stood in the door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no money, to pay even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed Cynthia\\n\\nwhen Jonah Winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner, Deacon, Lysander raps for order and the minister prays. They proceed, first, to, elect a representative to the General Court. The Jacksonians do not, contest that seat,--this year,--and Isaiah Prescott, fourteenth child of, Timothy, the Stark hero, father of a young Ephraim whom we shall hear, from later, is elected. And now! Now for a sensation, now for disorder, and misrule!\\n\\nThe cry is taken up all over the meeting-house, and rises high above the, hiss of the sleet on the great windows. Somebody's got on the stove, to, add to the confusion and horror. The only man in the whole place who is, not excited is Jethro Bass himself, who sits in his chair regardless of, those pressing around him. Many years afterward he confessed to some one, that he was surprised--and this is true. Fletcher Bartlett had surprised, and tricked him, but was forgiven. Forty men are howling at the, moderator, who is pounding on the table with a blacksmith's blows. Squire, Asa Northcutt, with his arms fanning like a windmill from the edge of the, platform, at length shouts down everybody else--down to a hum. Some, listen to him: hear the words \\\"infamous outrage\\\"--\\\"if Jethro Bass is, elected Selectman, Coniston will never be able to hold up her head among, her sister towns for very shame.\\\" (Momentary blank, for somebody has got, on the stove again, a scuffle going on there.) \\\"I see it all now,\\\" says, the Squire--(marvel of perspicacity!) \\\"Jethro Bass has debased and, debauched this town--\\\" (blank again, and the squire points a finger of, rage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair) \\\"he has bought and, intimidated men to do his bidding. He has sinned against heaven, and, against the spirit of that most immortal of documents--\\\" (Blank again., Most unfortunate blank, for this is becoming oratory, but somebody from, below has seized the squire by the leg.) Squire Northcutt is too, dignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble, but he did, get his leg liberated and kicked Fletcher Bartlett in the face. Oh\\n\\nAt last, by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties, something, like order is restored, the ballots are in the box, and Deacon Lysander, is counting them: not like another moderator I have heard of, who spilled, the votes on the floor until his own man was elected. No. Had they, registered his own death sentence, the deacon would have counted them, straight, and needed no town clerk to verify his figures. But when he, came to pronounce the vote, shame and sorrow and mortification overcame, him. Coniston, his native town, which he had served and revered, was, dishonored, and it was for him, Lysander Richardson, to proclaim her, disgrace. The deacon choked, and tears of bitterness stood in his eyes\\n\\nShe darted swiftly past him, seizing the door and drawing it closed after, her. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face., Her own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with a shame that, was insupportable. Now that she was there, beside him, her strength, failed her, and her courage--courage that she had been storing for this, dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day. Now that she, was there, she would have given her life to have been able to retrace her, steps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the mountain.\\n\\n\\\"The only one of importance,\\\" he answered. \\\"This week, when I went to, Coniston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and, a most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I tried to get, him to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen., Suddenly he turned on me and asked me if I was 'callatin' to set up a, mill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters, in Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?\\\"\\n\\nNo one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who are, willing to risk their necks and their horses' legs for the sake of, scenery. The tough little Morgans of that time, which kept their feet, like cats, have all but disappeared, but there were places on that road, where Lyman Hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a, stretch. He was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom, to enjoy the beauties of such a trip, and nearly everybody in Coniston, was afraid of him. Jethro Bass would sit silent on the seat for hours, and--it is a fact to be noted that when he told Lyman to do a thing\\n\\n\\\"It is perhaps an open secret,\\\" continued Mr. Worthington, \\\"that in the, near future I intend to establish a free library in Brampton. I feel it, my duty to do all I can for the town where I have made my success, and, there is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good, library.\\\" Whereupon he shot at Wetherell another of his keen looks. \\\"I do, not talk this way ordinarily to my customers, Mr. Wetherell,\\\" he began;, \\\"but you interest me, and I am going to tell you something in confidence., I am sure it will not be betrayed.\\\"\\n\\nworking side by side, sharing this strange secret between them. And after, that night Cynthia talked to him often of Coniston, until he came to know, the mountain that lay along the western sky, and the sweet hillsides by, Coniston Water under the blue haze of autumn, aye, and clothed in the, colors of spring, the bright blossoms of thorn and apple against the, tender green of the woods and fields. So he grew to love the simple, people there, but little did he foresee that he was to end his life among, them!\\n\\nThey sat in the summer twilight, until darkness fell, and the lights, gleamed through the leaves, and a deep, cool breath coming up from the, sea stirred the leaves above their heads. That she should have loved, Jethro seemed as strange to her as to him, and yet Wetherell was to feel, the irresistible force of him. Hers was not a love that she chose, or, would have chosen, but something elemental that cried out from the man to, her, and drew her. Something that had in it now, as of yore, much of pain, and even terror, but drew her. Strangest of all was that William, Wetherell understood and was not jealous of this thing: which leads us to, believe that some essence of virility was lacking in him, some substance, that makes the fighters and conquerors in this world. In such mood he, listened to the story of Jethro Bass.\\n\\n\\\"We have been compelled to see what was weak in democracy as well as,    what was strong. We have begun obscurely to recognize that things,    do not go of themselves, and that popular government is not in,    itself a panacea, is no better than any other form except as the,    virtue and wisdom of the people make it so, and that when men,    undertake to do their own kingship, they enter upon, the dangers and,    responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function. Above,    all, it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no,    government can be carried on by declamation.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time a stranger in Brampton was enough to set the town agog. But, a young man of three and twenty, with an independent income of four, hundred dollars a year!--or any income at all not derived from his own, labor--was unheard of. It is said that when the stage from over Truro Gap, arrived in Brampton Street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen, from, various ambushes, and followed him up the walk to Silas Wheelock's, where, he was to board. In half an hour Brampton knew the essentials of Isaac, Worthington's story, and Sam Price was on his way with it to Coniston for, distribution at Jonah Winch's store.\\n\\nWetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation, had taken. It seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to face, again wish the man whom Cynthia Ware had never been able to drive from, her heart. Would, he mention her? Had he continued to love her, in spite, of the woman he had married and adorned? Wetherell asked himself these, questions before he spoke.\\n\\nMeanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in. Jabez Miller, on, the north slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that he, was going to vote for Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team and went, out to see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then plumped, the question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out. Jabez hemmed, and hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some length about the, American citizen, however humble, having a right to vote as he chose. A, most unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter very mysterious and not, a little ominous. Moses drove homeward that sparkling day, shutting his, eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines, and thinking, profoundly. He made other excursions, enough to satisfy himself that this, disease, so new and unheard of (the right of the unfit to hold office)\\n\\nand behind it was the shed, or barn, that served as the tannery, and, between the tannery and Coniston Water were the vats. The rain flew in, silvery spray, and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young man, who stood looking in at the tannery door. Young Jake Wheeler, son of the, village spendthrift, was driving a lean white horse round in a ring: to, the horse was attached a beam, and on the beam a huge round stone rolled, on a circular oak platform. Jethro Bass, who was engaged in pushing, hemlock bark under the stone to be crushed, straightened. Of the three\\n\\nThere he stood, indeed, the man of leisure, and to-day he wore his beaver, hat. No, he had not yet read the 'Last of the Mohicans.' There were, things in it that Mr. Worthington would like to discuss with Miss, Penniman. Was it not a social library? At this juncture there came a, giggle from within that made him turn scarlet, and he scarcely heard Miss, Lucretia offering to discuss the whole range of letters. Enter Mr., Worthington, bows profoundly to Miss Lucretia's guest, his beaver in his, hand, and the discussion begins, Cynthia taking no part in it. Strangely, enough, Mr. Worthington's remarks on American Indians are not only, intelligent, but interesting. The clock strikes four, Miss Lucretia, starts up, suddenly remembering that she has promised to read to an, invalid, and with many regrets from Mr. Worthington, she departs. Then he, sits down again, twirling his beaver, while Cynthia looks at him in quiet, amusement.\\n\\n\\\"Jethro Bass,\\\" said Jock, who, by reason of his ability, was a privileged, character. \\\"Mark my words, Cynthy, Jethro Bass is an all-fired sight, smarter that folks in this town think he be. They don't take notice of, him, because he don't say much, and stutters. He hain't be'n eddicated a, great deal, but I wouldn't be afeard to warrant he'd make a racket in the, world some of these days.\\\"\\n\\nOn Saturday Cynthia bought a new bonnet in Brampton; Sunday morning put, it on, suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor God, and wore, her old one; walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be, denied, and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin in, Coniston. No Jethro! General opinion (had she waited to hear it among the, horse sheds or on the green), that Jethro's soul had slid back into the, murky regions, from which it were folly for even Cynthia to try to drag, it.\\n\\nLet it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in Coniston;, and something which, for the sake of an advantageous parallel, we may, call an Established Church. Coniston was a Congregational town still, and, the deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars of, the state. Not many years before the time of which we write actual, disestablishment had occurred, when the town ceased--as a town--to pay, the salary of Priest Ware, as the minister was called. The father of, Jethro Bass, Nathan the currier, had once, in a youthful lapse, permitted, a Baptist preacher to immerse him in Coniston Water. This had been the, extent of Nathan's religion; Jethro had none at all, and was, for this, and other reasons, somewhere near the bottom of the social scale.\\n\\nThe deacon sat down, and men say that a great sob shook him, while, Jacksonian Democracy went wild--not looking into future years to see what, they were going wild about. Jethro Bass Chairman of the Board of, Selectmen, in the honored place of Deacon Moses Hatch! Bourbon royalists, never looked with greater abhorrence on the Corsican adventurer and, usurper of the throne than did the orthodox in Coniston on this tanner\\n\\nTo prove that Jethro's soul had not slid back into the murky regions, and, that it was still indulging in flights, it is necessary to follow him, (for a very short space) to Boston. Jethro himself went in Lyman Hull's, six-horse team with a load of his own merchandise--hides that he had, tanned, and other country produce. And they did not go by the way of, Truro Pass to the Capital, but took the state turnpike over the ranges\\n\\nYes, we may have our suspicions. But how can we get a bill on this, evidence? There are some thirty other individuals in Coniston whose, mortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not, likely that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; that they are going to, town meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass, wishes them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to., If so, where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our, starting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we, have the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not, know whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under, his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had, never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in, his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the, news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at, the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that\\n\\nand for some months thereafter, she kept to herself. Honest Moses Hatch, pursued his courting untroubled, and never knew that he had a rival., Moses would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as, Cynthia's changes of moods,--which were indeed the weather for him, and, when storms came he sat with his back to them, waiting for the sunshine., He had long ceased proposing marriage, in the firm belief that Cynthia, would set the day in her own good time. Thereby he was saved much, suffering.\\n\\nto the whippoorwills calling across Coniston Water. But at last a peace, descended upon him, and he slept: yes, and awoke with the same sense of, peace at little Cynthia's touch, to go out into the cool morning, when, the mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the rising sun., Behind the store was an old-fashioned garden, set about by a neat stone, wall, hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and currant bushes\\n\\nFirst I am to write a love-story of long ago, of a time some little while, after General Jackson had got into the White House and had shown the, world what a real democracy was. The Era of the first six Presidents had, closed, and a new Era had begun. I am speaking of political Eras. Certain, gentlemen, with a pious belief in democracy, but with a firmer, determination to get on top, arose,--and got in top. So many of these, gentlemen arose in the different states, and they were so clever, and, they found so many chinks in the Constitution to crawl through and steal, the people's chestnuts, that the Era may be called the Boss-Era. After, the Boss came along certain Things without souls, but of many minds, and, found more chinks in the Constitution: bigger chinks, for the Things were, bigger, and they stole more chestnuts. But I am getting far ahead of my, love-story--and of my book.\\n\\nThe parsonage was of only one story, with a steep, sloping roof. On the, left of the doorway was Cynthia's room, and the minister imagined he, heard a faint, rustling noise at her window. Presently he arose, barred, the door; could be heard moving around in his room for a while, and, after that all was silence save for the mournful crying of a whippoorwill, in the woods. Then a door opened softly, a white vision stole into the, little entry lighted by the fan-window, above, seized the book and stole, back. Had the minister been a prying man about his household, he would, have noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was burned down to the, socket. He saw nothing of the kind: he saw, in fact, that his daughter, flitted about the house singing, and he went out into the sun to drop, potatoes.\\n\\nThe price was paid, in part, during the next six days. To do Jethro's, importance absolute justice, he did inspire fear among his, contemporaries, and young men and women did not say much to his face;, what they did say gave them little satisfaction. Grim Deacon Ira stopped, him as he was going to buy hides, and would have prayed over him if, Jethro had waited; dear Aunt Lucy did pray, but in private. In six days, orthodox Coniston came to the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul, were better left to her who had snatched it, Cynthia Ware.\\n\\nAnd now we must go back for a chapter--a very short chapter--to the day, before that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon the, history of Coniston and of the state. That Monday, too, it will be, remembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the, centre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke, in agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure, on the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door., Presently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open, released a, shaft of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a face beneath, a hood to him who stood within.\\n\\n\\\"I am proud of him, everybody's proud of him, Brampton's proud of, him--he's proud of himself. That's enough, ain't it?\\\" He eyed Wetherell, somewhat defiantly, then his glance wandered to Cynthia, and he walked, over to her. He threw himself down on the grass in front of her, and lay, looking up at her solemnly. For a while she continued to stare inflexibly, at the line of market wagons, and then she burst into a laugh.\\n\\nand listening to the brief colloquies he had with other men at Jonah, Winch's store, when she went there to buy things for the parsonage; and, it seemed to her that Jock had not been altogether wrong, and that there, was in the man an indefinable but very compelling force. And when a woman, begins to admit that a man has force, her curiosity usually increases. On, one or two of these occasions Cynthia had been startled to find his eyes, fixed upon her, and though the feeling she had was closely akin to fear\\n\\nJethro Bass turned. A bench ran along the farther wall, and there he, planted himself without a word, while the clerk stared at him,--with what, feelings of uneasiness I shall not attempt to describe,--for the customer, was plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one of them, forth. The minutes passed, and Wetherell began to hate him. Then some one, tried the door, peered in through the glass, perceived Jethro, shook the, knob, knocked violently, all to no purpose. Jethro seemed lost in a, reverie.\\n\\nThe ancient allegory of Cupid and the arrows has never been improved, upon: of Cupid, who should never in the world have been trusted with a, weapon, who defies all game laws, who shoots people in the bushes and, innocent bystanders generally, the weak and the helpless and the strong, and self-confident! There is no more reason in it than that. He shot, Cynthia Ware, and what she suffered in secret Coniston never guessed., What parallels in history shall I quote to bring home the enormity of, such a mesalliance? Orthodox Coniston would have gone into sackcloth and, ashes,--was soon to go into these, anyway.\\n\\nAt last, toward the end of June, it was noised about that the great man, was coming home for a few days. One beautiful afternoon William Wetherell, stood on the platform of the store, looking off at Coniston, talking to, Moses Hatch--young Moses, who is father of six children now and has, forgotten Cynthia Ware. Old Moses sleeps on the hillside, let us hope in, the peace of the orthodox and the righteous. A cloud of dust arose above, the road to the southward, and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a, fat horse, and in the wagon the strangest couple Wetherell had ever seen., The little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in, brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce, like a paroquet, red and green, predominating. The man, big in build, large-headed, wore an old-fashioned, blue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a stock, and coonskin hat\\n\\nNow let us take the concrete incident. Before that hypocritical thaw, early in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert--not so surly then as, he has since become--and talked about buying his wool when it should be, duly cut, and permitted Amos to talk about the position of second, selectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had, nominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely, pulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a, huge snow bank and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a, little dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.\\n\\nAs the winter wore on, and March town meeting approached, strange rumors, of a Democratic ticket began to drift into Jonah Winch's store,--a, Democratic ticket headed by Fletcher Bartlett, of all men, as chairman of, the board. Moses laughed when he first heard of it, for Fletcher was an, easy-going farmer of the Methodist persuasion who was always in debt, and, the other members of the ticket, so far as Moses could learn of it--were, remarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity. The rumors persisted, and, still Moses laughed, for the senior selectman was a big man with flesh on, him, who could laugh with dignity.\\n\\nHe left a tumultuous Cynthia, amazement and repentance struggling with, anger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to, pride in him, and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride. Had he but, known it, every step he took away from her that evening was a step in, advance, and she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back. As, she walked toward Coniston, the thought came to her that she was rid of, the thing she had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into, his song once more.\\n\\nYoung Mr. Worthington was from Boston--no less; slim, pale, medium, height, but with an alert look, and a high-bridged nose. But his clothes!, Sam Price's vocabulary was insufficient here, they were cut in such a, way, and Mr. Worthington was downright distinguished-looking under his, gray beaver. Why had he come to Brampton? demanded Deacon Ira Perkins., Sam had saved this for the last. Young Mr. Worthington was threatened, with consumption, and had been sent to live with his distant relative\\n\\nCynthia Ware, who had come to the store for buttons for Speedy Bates, who, was making a new coat for the minister, heard these remarks, and stood, thoughtfully staring at the blue coat-tails of the elders. A brass button, was gone from Deacon Lysander's, and she wanted to sew it on. Suddenly, she looked up, and saw Jock Hallowell standing beside her. Jock, winked--and Cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word. She, remembered, vividly enough, what Jack had told her the spring before, and, several times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying him, and asking what he knew. But she could not summon the courage. As a, matter of fact, Jock knew nothing, but he had a theory. He was a strange, man, Jock, who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with, nobody's business, as a rule. What had impelled him to talk to Cynthia in, the way he had must remain a mystery.\\n\\nUproarious laughter greeted the end of this story, and continued in fits, as some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners., William Wetherell perceived that the conversation, for the moment at, least, was safely away from politics, and in that dubious state where it, was difficult to reopen. This was perhaps what Jethro wanted. Even Jake, Wheeler was tongue-tied, and Jethro appeared to be lost in reflection.\\n\\nThey were walking in the twilight, for the sun had sunk all red in the, marshes of the Charles, when there chanced along a certain Mr. Judson, a, jeweller, taking the air likewise. So there came into Wetherell's mind, that amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket. His name, by, reason of some strange quality in it, he had never forgotten, and, suddenly he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was, Coniston.\\n\\nCynthia, driving back from Brampton in the gig, smiled at Aunt Lucy in, the window, but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house, farther on. The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro, dwelt, and which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery, sheds were at some distance behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia did, not glance at the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation had, swept over her: at any rate, we may call it so. In other words, she was, angry with herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be told, for, her actions--an inevitable mood.\\n\\nThe Whigs have theirs written out, Deacon Moses Hatch. But who has, written out these others that are being so assiduously passed around? Sam, Price, perhaps, for he is passing them most assiduously. And what name is, written on them? Fletcher Bartlett, of course; that was on the ticket., Somebody is tricked again. That is not the name on the ticket. Look over, Sara Price's shoulder and you will see the name--Jethro Bass.\\n\\nIt was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor Moses, and he, learned of it when he went to Jonah Winch's store an hour later. An hour, later, indeed, Coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a new light., It was possible that Cynthia might take him, and Deacon Ira Perkins made, a note the next time he went to Brampton to question Silas Wheelock on, Mr. Worthington's origin, habits, and orthodoxy.\\n\\nThe celebrated Social Library, halfway up the street, occupied part of, Miss Lucretia's little house; or, it might better be said, Miss Lucretia, boarded with the Social Library. There Cynthia hitched her horse, gave, greeting to Mr. Ezra Graves and others who paused, and, before she was, fairly in the door, was clasped in Miss Lucretia's arms. There were new, books to be discussed, arrived by the stage the day before; but scarce, half an hour had passed before Cynthia started guiltily at a timid knock\\n\\napparently, to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for, circulation. That Wetherell shared this excitement, too, he could not, deny, but for a different cause. At last, when the shadows of the big, trees had crept across the green, he came, the customers flocking to the, porch to greet him, Wetherell standing curiously behind them in the door., Heedless of the dust, he strode down the road with the awkward gait that, was all his own, kicking up his heels behind. And behind him, heels, kicking up likewise, followed Jake and Sam, Jethro apparently oblivious, of their presence. A modest silence was maintained from the stoop, broken, at length by Lem Hallowell, who (men said) was an exact reproduction of, Jock, the meeting-house builder. Lem alone was not abashed in the, presence of greatness.\\n\\nCynthia was not only the minister's daughter,--distinction enough,--her, reputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout, and at, the age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in Harwich. Once a, week in summer she went to Brampton, to the Social library there, and sat, at the feet of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom Brampton has ever been, so proud--Lucretia Penniman, one of the first to sound the clarion note, for the intellectual independence of American women; who wrote the \\\"Hymn, to Coniston\\\"; who, to the awe of her townspeople, went out into the great, world and became editress of a famous woman's journal, and knew, Longfellow and Hawthorne and Bryant. Miss Lucretia it was who started the, Brampton Social Library, and filled it with such books as both sexes, might read with profit. Never was there a stricter index than hers., Cynthia, Miss Lucretia loved, and the training of that mind was the, pleasantest task of her life.\\n\\nMonday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still, refer, and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which, we shall have to pass by for the present; on Tuesday, the sleet still, raging, came the historic town meeting. Deacon Moses Hatch, his chores, done and his breakfast and prayers completed, fought his way with his, head down through a white waste to the meeting-house door, and unlocked, it, and shivered as he made the fire. It was certainly not good election, weather, thought Moses, and others of the orthodox persuasion, high in, office, were of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails, before the stove. Whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes\\n\\nJethro stepped out, passing Mr. Worthington as though he had already, forgotten that gentleman's existence, and seized an armful of bark that, lay under cover of a lean-to. Just then, heralded by a brightening of the, western sky, a girl appeared down the road, her head bent a little as in, thought, and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave no sign., Two of them stared at her--Jake Wheeler and Mr. Worthington. Suddenly, Jake, implike, turned and stared at Worthington.\\n\\nContrast is a favorite trick of authors, and no greater contrast is to be, had in Coniston than that between Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. In the, first place; Cynthia was the minister's daughter, and twenty-one. I can, summon her now under the great maples of the village street, a virginal, figure, gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke bonnet, and up, you went above the clouds.\\n\\nalthough he could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free, Library and the Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the, church and the great marble monument on the hill--to another woman. All, of these things, and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only, accepted that promise to pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle, more robust than when he came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she, doubted his promise to pay.\\n\\nactually existed. Where the germ began that caused it, Moses knew no, better than the deacon, since those who were suspected of leanings toward, Fletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive. The practical result of, Moses' profound thought was a meeting, in his own house, without respect, to party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened by a prayer from the minister, himself. The meeting, after a futile session, broke up dismally. Sedition, and conspiracy existed; a chief offender and master mind there was\\n\\nIt is a fact--for future consideration--that Isaac Worthington proposed, to Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira Perkins, heard him do so. It had been very carefully prepared, that speech, and, was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr., Worthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to be--not, for what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large amount\\n\\nThis man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized and, marshalled the loose vote, was the author of that ticket, who sat in his, corner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the, maledictions of his enemies; who rose to take his oath of office as, unconcerned as though the house were empty, albeit Deacon Lysander could, scarcely get the words out. And then Jethro sat down again in his, chair--not to leave it for six and thirty years. From this time forth, that chair became a seat of power, and of dominion over a state.\\n\\nflows southward around the south end of Coniston Mountain, and having, turned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows westward in its own, green valley until it comes to Harwich, where it works again and tumbles, into a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals, but Coniston Water gives, of its power impartially to each. From the little farm clearings on the, western slope of Coniston Mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a, certain broad river where grew (and grow still) the giant pines that gave, many a mast to King George's navy as tribute for the land. And beyond, that river rises beautiful Farewell Mountain of many colors, now, sapphire, now amethyst, its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron, flame; and, beyond Farewell, the emerald billows of the western peaks, catching the level light. A dozen little brooks are born high among the, western spruces on Coniston to score deep, cool valleys in their way, through Clovelly township to the broad music of the water and fresh, river-valleys full of the music of the water and fresh with the odor of, the ferns.\",\n          \"The command was given in his most imperious manner, and his daughter, dropped her muff in some resentment as she rose, in order to let him have, the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hardy pick it up.  It rolled, however, in his, direction, and he stooped for it just as Hardy darted forward.  Their, heads met with a crash, and Miss Nugent forgot her own consternation in, the joy of beholding the pitiable exhibition which terror made of Mr., Wilks.\\n\\nFor some days, however, he looked for Jack Nugent in vain, that gentleman, either being out of doors engaged in an earnest search for work, or, snugly seated in the back parlour of the Kybirds, indulging in the, somewhat perilous pastime of paying compliments to Amelia Kybird., Remittances which had reached him from his sister and aunt had been, promptly returned, and he was indebted to the amiable Mr. Kybird for the, bare necessaries of life.  In these circumstances a warm feeling of, gratitude towards the family closed his eyes to their obvious, shortcomings.\\n\\nThe captain, hardly able to believe his ears, came to an impressive stop, in the roadway, but Miss Nugent walked on.  She felt instinctively that, the joke was thrown away on him, and, in the absence of any other, audience, wanted to enjoy it without interruption.  Convulsive and, half-suppressed sounds, which she ascribed to a slight cold caught while, waiting in the kitchen, escaped her at intervals for the remainder of the, journey home.\\n\\nBoth men protested.  The captain because it ill-assorted with his dignity, for his daughter to sit in the kitchen, and Mr. Wilks because of the, visitor already there.  The face of the steward, indeed, took on such, extraordinary expressions in his endeavour to convey private information, to the girl that she gazed at him in silent amazement.  Then she turned, the handle of the door and, passing through, closed it with a bang which, was final.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't,\\\" said Mr. Nugent, truthfully.  The situation had developed so, rapidly that it had caught him at a disadvantage.  He had a dim feeling, that, having been the cause of Miss Kybird's losing one young man, the, most elementary notions of chivalry demanded that he should furnish her, with another.  And this idea was clearly uppermost in the minds of her, parents.  He looked over at Amelia and with characteristic philosophy, accepted the position.\\n\\nTime failed to soften the captain's ideas concerning his son's, engagement, and all mention of the subject in the house was strictly, forbidden.  Occasionally he was favoured with a glimpse of his son and, Miss Kybird out together, a sight which imparted such a flavour to his, temper and ordinary intercourse that Mrs. Kingdom, in unconscious, imitation of Mr. James Hardy, began to count the days which must elapse, before her niece's return from London.  His ill-temper even infected the, other members of the household, and Mrs. Kingdom sat brooding in her, bedroom all one afternoon, because Bella had called her an \\\"overbearing, dish-pot.\\\"\\n\\nBefore he saw Kate Nugent again, however, another old acquaintance turned, up safe and sound in Sunwich.  Captain Nugent walking into the town saw, him first: a tall, well-knit young man in shabby clothing, whose bearing, even in the distance was oddly familiar.  As he came closer the captain's, misgivings were confirmed, and in the sunburnt fellow in tattered clothes, who advanced upon him with out-stretched hand he reluctantly recognized, his son.\\n\\nAt these valuables Jack Nugent, with a view of obtaining some idea of, prices, gazed for some time.  Then passing between two suits of oilskins, which stood as sentinels in the doorway, he entered the shop and smiled, affably at Miss Kybird, who was in charge.  At his entrance she put down, a piece of fancy-work, which Mr. Kybird called his sock, and with a, casual glance at his clothes regarded him with a prejudiced eye.\\n\\nHe even obtained work down at the harbour through a friend of Mr., Kybird's.  It was not of a very exalted nature, and caused more strain, upon the back than the intellect, but seven years of roughing it had left, him singularly free from caste prejudices, a freedom which he soon, discovered was not shared by his old acquaintances at Sunwich.  The, discovery made him somewhat bitter, and when Hardy stopped him one, afternoon as he was on his way home from work he tried to ignore his, outstretched hand and continued on his way.\\n\\nThey were more surprised an evening or two later to see Mr. Wilks leave, his house to pay a return visit, bearing in his hand a small bunch of his, cherished blooms.  That they were blooms which would have paid the debt, of Nature in a few hours at most in no way detracted from the widow's, expressions of pleasure at receiving them, and Mr. Wilks, who had been, invited over to cheer up Mr. Silk, who was in a particularly black mood\\n\\nHe looked up the street, and then, the well-known shop of Mr. Kybird, catching his eye, walked over and inspected the contents of the window., Sheath-knives, belts, tobacco-boxes, and watches were displayed, alluringly behind the glass, sheltered from the sun by a row of cheap, clothing dangling from short poles over the shop front.  All the goods, were marked in plain figures in reduced circumstances, Mr. Kybird giving, a soaring imagination play in the first marking, and a good business, faculty in the second.\\n\\nThe object of Mr. Hardy's search sat at the door of his front room, which, opened on to the alley, smoking an evening pipe, and noting with an, interested eye the doings of his neighbours.  He was just preparing to, draw himself up in his chair as the intruder passed, when to his utter, astonishment that gentleman stopped in front of him, and taking, possession of his hand shook it fervently.\\n\\nTheir talk was mainly of Sunwich and Sunwich people, and it was an easy, step from these to Equator Lodge.  On that subject most people would have, found the ex-steward somewhat garrulous, but Jem Hardy listened with, great content, and even brought him back to it when he showed signs of, wandering.  Altogether Mr. Wilks spent one of the pleasantest evenings of, his life, and, returning home in a slight state of mental exhilaration\\n\\nHe walked home somewhat soberly at first, but the air was cool and fresh, and a glorious moon was riding in the sky.  He whistled cheerfully, and, his spirits rose as various chimerical plans of making money occurred to, him.  By the time he reached the High Street, the shops of which were all, closed for the night, he was earning five hundred a year and spending a, thousand.  He turned the handle of the door and, walking in, discovered, Miss Kybird entertaining company in the person of Mr. Edward Silk.\\n\\nThere was something about the vessel which took his fancy, and he stood, for some time on the edge of the quay, looking at her.  In a day or two, she would sail for a voyage the length of which would depend upon her, success; a voyage which would for a long period keep all on board of her, out of the mischief which so easily happens ashore.  If only Jack----\\n\\nThe honour was so unexpected that Mr. Wilks, coming into the parlour in, response to the tapping of the captain's stick on the floor, stood for a, short time eyeing him in dismay.  Only two minutes before he had taken, Mr. James Hardy into the kitchen to point out the interior beauties of, an ancient clock, and the situation simply appalled him.  The captain, greeted him almost politely and bade him sit down.  Mr. Wilks smiled, faintly and caught his breath.\\n\\ncalmly observant, the slightest suggestion of disdain in her expression., Framed in the queer, high-backed old chair which had belonged to Mr., Wilks's grandfather, she made a picture at which Jem Hardy continued to, gaze with respectful ardour.  A hopeless sense of self-depreciation, possessed him, but the idea that Murchison should aspire to so much, goodness and beauty made him almost despair of his sex.  His reverie was, broken by the voice of Mr. Wilks.\\n\\nThe anticipations of Mr. Wilks were more than realized on the following, Tuesday.  From the time a trim maid showed him into the smoking-room, until late at night, when he left, a feted and honoured guest, with one, of his host's best cigars between his teeth, nothing that could yield him, any comfort was left undone.  In the easiest of easy chairs he sat in the, garden beneath the leafy branches of apple trees, and undiluted wisdom, and advice flowed from his lips in a stream as he beamed delightedly upon, his entertainer.\\n\\nOne by one various schemes for preventing his son's projected alliance, were dismissed as impracticable.  A cherished design of confining him in, an asylum for the mentally afflicted until such time as he should have, regained his senses was spoilt by the refusal of Dr. Murchison to arrange, for the necessary certificate; a refusal which was like to have been, fraught with serious consequences to that gentleman's hopes of entering, the captain's family.\\n\\nThe shopkeeper stood considering.  He had a small room to let at the top, of his house, and he stood divided between the fear of not getting his, rent and the joy to a man fond of simple pleasures, to be obtained by, dunning the arrogant Captain Nugent for his son's debts.  Before he could, arrive at a decision his meditations were interrupted by the entrance of, a stout, sandy-haired lady from the back parlour, who, having conquered, his scruples against matrimony some thirty years before, had kept a, particularly wide-awake eye upon him ever since.\\n\\nIn the next room conversation was also proceeding, but fitfully.  Miss, Nugent's consternation when she closed the door behind her and found, herself face to face with Mr. Hardy was difficult of concealment.  Too, late she understood the facial contortions of Mr. Wilks, and, resigning, herself to the inevitable, accepted the chair placed for her by the, highly pleased Jem, and sat regarding him calmly from the other side of, the fender.\\n\\nMiss Nugent eyed him wistfully and racked her brains for an appropriate, and crushing rejoinder.  In all her experience--and it was considerable, considering her years--she had never met with such carefully constructed, audacity, and she longed, with a great longing, to lure him into the open, and destroy him.  She was still considering ways and means of doing this, when the door opened and revealed the surprised and angry form of her, father and behind it the pallid countenance of Mr. Wilks.  For a moment, anger deprived the captain of utterance.\\n\\nThe most astounding and gratifying instance of the wonders effected by, time was that of Miss Nugent.  He saw her first at the window, and with a, ready recognition of the enchantment lent by distance took the first, possible opportunity of a closer observation.  He then realized the, enchantment afforded by proximity.  The second opportunity led him, impetuously into a draper's shop, where a magnificent shop-walker, after, first ceremoniously handing him a high cane chair, passed on his order, for pins in a deep and thrilling baritone, and retired in good order.\\n\\nMr. Nugent's return caused a sensation in several quarters, the feeling, at Equator Lodge bordering close upon open mutiny.  Even Mrs. Kingdom, plucked up spirit and read the astonished captain a homily upon the first, duties of a parent--a homily which she backed up by reading the story of, the Prodigal Son through to the bitter end.  At the conclusion she broke, down entirely and was led up to bed by Kate and Bella, the sympathy of, the latter taking an acute form, and consisting mainly of innuendoes, which could only refer to one person in the house.\\n\\nUpstairs in the tiny room under the tiles Mr. Jack Nugent, in blissful, ignorance of his landlord's generous sentiments towards him, slept the, sound, dreamless sleep of the man free from monetary cares.  In the, sanctity of her chamber Miss Kybird, gazing approvingly at the reflection, of her yellow hair and fine eyes in the little cracked looking-glass, was, already comparing him very favourably with the somewhat pessimistic Mr., Silk.\\n\\nand turned a deaf ear to the voluble sympathy of his neighbours.  Similar, things had happened to young men living there before, but their behaviour, had been widely different to Mr. Silk's.  Bob Crump, for instance, had, been jilted on the very morning he had arranged for his wedding, but, instead of going about in a state of gentle melancholy he went round and, fought his beloved's father--merely because it was her father--and wound, up an exciting day by selling off his household goods to the highest, bidders.  Henry Jones in similar circumstances relieved his great grief, by walking up and down the alley smashing every window within reach of, his stick.\\n\\nMeantime they passed each other as strangers, and the difficulty of, approaching her only made the task more alluring.  In the second week he, reckoned up that he had seen her nine times.  It was a satisfactory, total, but at the same time he could not shut his eyes to the fact that, five times out of that number he had seen Dr. Murchison as well, and, neither of them appeared to have seen him.\\n\\nHe started and stared more intently than before.  He was not an, imaginative man, but he had in his mind's eye a sudden vision of his only, son waving farewells from the deck of the whaler as she emerged from the, harbour into the open sea, while Amelia Kybird tore her yellow locks, ashore.  It was a vision to cheer any self-respecting father's heart, and, he brought his mind back with some regret to the reality of the anchored, ship.\\n\\nBrooding over his wrongs the captain, a day or two after his daughter's, return, strolled slowly down towards the harbour.  It was afternoon, and, the short winter day was already drawing towards a close.  The shipping, looked cold and desolate in the greyness, but a bustle of work prevailed, on the Conqueror, which was nearly ready for sea again.  The captain's, gaze wandered from his old craft to the small vessels dotted about the, harbour and finally dwelt admiringly on the lines of the whaler Seabird\\n\\nMr. Wilks nodded, and despite his hostess's protests rose to go.  He, shook hands with her and, after a short but sharp inward struggle, shook, hands with her son.  It was late in the evening as he left, but the, houses had not yet been lit up.  Dim figures sat in doorways or stood, about the alley, and there was an air of peace and rest strangely and, uncomfortably in keeping with the conversation to which he had just been, listening.  He looked in at his own door; the furniture seemed stiffer, than usual and the tick of the clock more deliberate.  He closed the door, again and, taking a deep breath, set off towards the life and bustle of, the Two Schooners.\\n\\nThe remark was certainly descriptive of Mr. Nugent's behaviour.  His easy, assurance and affability had already made him a prime favourite with Mrs., Kybird, and had not been without its effect upon her daughter.  The, constrained and severe company manners of Mr. Edward Silk showed up but, poorly beside those of the paying guest, and Miss Kybird had on several, occasions drawn comparisons which would have rendered both gentlemen, uneasy if they had known of them.\\n\\nA sudden wave of colour swept over the girl's face at the ingenuity of, this mode of attack.  She was used to attention and took compliments as, her due, but the significant audacity of this one baffled her.  She sat, with downcast eyes looking at the fender occasionally glancing from the, corner of her eye to see whether he was preparing to renew the assault., He had certainly changed from the Jem Hardy of olden days.  She had a, faint idea that his taste had improved.\\n\\nHe walked home slowly.  At the Kybirds' door the proprietor, smoking a, short clay pipe, eyed him with furtive glee as he passed.  Farther along, the road the Hardys, father and son, stepped briskly together., Altogether a trying walk, and calculated to make him more dissatisfied, than ever with the present state of affairs.  When his daughter shook her, head at him and accused him of going off on a solitary frolic his stock, of patience gave out entirely.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
