Breakfast was laid, for him in the coffee-room, and his brow darkened.  He walked into the, hall, and after trying various doors entered a small sitting-room, where, his host and daughter sat at breakfast, and with an easy assurance drew a, chair to the table.  The innkeeper helped him without a word, but the, girl's hand shook under his gaze as she passed him some coffee.\\n\\nThe arrogance of Gunn knew no bounds.  The maids learned to tremble at, his polite grin, or his worse freedom, and the men shrank appalled from, his profane wrath.  George, after ten years' service, was brutally, dismissed, and refusing to accept dismissal from his hands, appealed to, his master.  The innkeeper confirmed it, and with lack-lustre eyes fenced, feebly when his daughter, regardless of Gunn's presence, indignantly, appealed to him.\\n\\nAfter the first rally the innkeeper began to fail slowly.  It was seldom, that he understood what was said to him, and pitiful to the beholder to, see in his intervals of consciousness his timid anxiety to earn the good-, will of the all-powerful Gunn.  His strength declined until assistance, was needed to turn him in the bed, and his great sinewy hands were, forever trembling and fidgeting on the coverlet.\\n\\nThe surgeon was a man of few words and fewer attainments, but under his, ministrations the innkeeper, after a long interval, rallied.  The half-, closed eyes opened, and he looked in a dazed fashion at his surroundings., Gunn drove the servants away and questioned the man of medicine.  The, answers were vague and interspersed with Latin.  Freedom from noise and, troubles of all kinds was insisted upon and Joan was installed as nurse\\n\\nAffairs at the \\\"Golden Key\\\" grew steadily worse and worse.  Gunn, dominated the place, and his vile personality hung over it like a shadow., Appeals to the innkeeper were in vain; his health was breaking fast, and, he moodily declined to interfere.  Gunn appointed servants of his own, choosing-brazen maids and foul-mouthed men.  The old patrons ceased to, frequent the \\\"Golden Key,\\\" and its bedrooms stood empty.  The maids, scarcely deigned to take an order from Joan, and the men spoke to her, familiarly.  In the midst of all this the innkeeper, who had complained, once or twice of vertigo, was seized with a fit.\\n\\nHe averted his face, and for a time gazed sternly and watchfully at the, door.  Then he rose slowly to his feet, and taking the dead man in his, arms, bore him slowly and carefully to his room, and laid him a huddled, heap on the floor.  Swiftly and noiselessly he put the dead man's shoes, on and turned his pockets inside out, kicked a rug out of place, and put, a guinea on the floor.  Then he stole cautiously down stairs and set a, small door at the back open.  A dog barked frantically, and he hurried, back to his room.  The nurse still slumbered by the fire.\\n\\nThe door closed silently, and was opened a little later by the dubious, George coming in to set a bountiful repast.  Gunn, after cursing him for, his slowness and awkwardness, drew his chair to the table and made the, meal of one seldom able to satisfy his hunger.  He finished at last, and, after sitting for some time smoking, with his legs sprawled on the, fender, rang for a candle and demanded to be shown to his room.\\n\\n, A man came slowly over the old stone bridge, and averting his gaze from, the dark river with its silent craft, looked with some satisfaction, toward the feeble lights of the small town on the other side.  He walked, with the painful, forced step of one who has already trudged far.  His, worsted hose, where they were not darned, were in holes, and his coat and, knee-breeches were rusty with much wear, but he straightened himself as, he reached the end of the bridge and stepped out bravely to the taverns, which stood in a row facing the quay.\",\n          \"After running a long way, and as the last of the light was, disappearing, she passed under a tree with drooping branches. It, dropped its branches to the ground all about her, and caught her as in, a trap. She struggled to get out, but the branches pressed her closer, and closer to the trunk. She was in great terror and distress, when the, air-fish, swimming into the thicket of branches, began tearing them, with its beak. They loosened their hold at once, and the creature went, on attacking them, till at length they let the child go. Then the, air-fish came from behind her, and swam on in front, glittering and, sparkling all lovely colours; and she followed.\\n\\n\\\"Am I?\\\" she returned. \\\"Oh, I have waited for you so long! But you, you, are like the Old Man of the Sea. No. You are like the Old Man of the, Earth. No, no. You are like the oldest man of all. You are like them, all. And yet you are my own old Mossy! How did you come here? What did, you do after I lost you? Did you find the key-hole? Have you got the, key still?\\\"\\n\\nand looking everywhere for the thimble. Tricksey-Wee immediately laid, hold of it in both her arms, and lifted it about an inch nearer to the, nose of the peering giantess. This movement made the old lady see where, it was, and, her finger popping into it, it vanished from the eyes of, Tricksey-Wee, buried in the folds of a white stocking like a cloud in, the sky, which Mrs. Giant was busy darning. For it was Saturday night\\n\\nHe disguised himself, and, going to the palace, requested to see the, lord chamberlain. His appearance at once gained his request; and the, lord chamberlain, being a man of some insight, perceived that there was, more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear. He felt likewise, that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties, might arise. So he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoe-black to, the princess. It was rather cunning in the prince to request such an, easy post, for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as, other princesses. He soon learned all that could be learned about the, princess. He went nearly distracted; but after roaming about the lake, for days, and diving in every depth that remained, all that he could do, was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never, called for.\\n\\nNo one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before.--When, the prince saw her ascend, he thought he must have been bewitched, and, have mistaken a great swan for a lady. But the princess caught hold of, the topmost cone upon a lofty fir. This came off; but she caught at, another, and, in fact, stopped herself by gathering cones, dropping, them as the stocks gave way. The prince, meantime, stood in the water\\n\\n\\\"I know what you mean,\\\" returned the lady. \\\"You do not like to eat the, messenger that brought you home. But it is the kindest return you can, make. The creature was afraid to go until it saw me put the pot on, and, heard me promise it should be boiled the moment it returned with you., Then it darted out of the door at once. You saw it go into the pot of, itself the moment it entered, did you not?\\\"\\n\\nThe prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very, like other people. And besides this, she was not so forward in her, questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore. Neither did she, laugh so much; and when she did laugh, it was more gently. She seemed, altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it. But, when the prince, who had really fallen in love when he fell in the, lake, began to talk to her about love, she always turned her head, towards him and laughed. After a while she began to look puzzled, as if, she were trying to understand what he meant, but could not--revealing a, notion that he meant something. But as soon as ever she left the lake\\n\\nconsisting in part of a troop of light horse, for fear of the liberties, which the wind might take with her. And the king grew more apprehensive, with increasing years, till at last he would not allow her to walk, abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many, parts of her dress, and held by twenty noblemen. Of course horseback, was out of the question. But she bade good-bye to all this ceremony, when she got into the water.\\n\\nsinking as it sank, withering as it dried. When at length he discovered, the change that was taking place in the level of the water, he was in, great alarm and perplexity. He could not tell whether the lake was, dying because the lady had forsaken it; or whether the lady would not, come because the lake had begun to sink. But he resolved to know so, much at least.\\n\\nHere they sat down to consider what could be done. The spiders did not, heed them, but ate away at the flies.--Now, at the foot of the, mountain, and all round it, was a ring of water, not very broad, but, very deep. As they sat watching them, one of the spiders, whose web was, woven across this water, somehow or other lost his hold, and fell in on, his back. Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob ran to his assistance, and laying, hold each of one of his legs, succeeded, with the help of the other, legs, which struggled spiderfully, in getting him out upon dry land. As, soon as he had shaken himself, and dried himself a little, the spider, turned to the children, saying,--\\n\\nThe next moment she descried, in a corner of the cave, a little naked, child sitting on the moss. He was playing with balls of various colours, and sizes, which he disposed in strange figures upon the floor beside, him. And now Tangle felt that there was something in her knowledge, which was not in her understanding. For she knew there must be an, infinite meaning in the change and sequence and individual forms of the, figures into which the child arranged the balls, as well as in the, varied harmonies of their colours, but what it all meant she could not, tell.* He went on busily, tirelessly, playing his solitary game\\n\\nAfter a while, however, the cave began to glimmer again. The light came, from the moon, but it did not look like moonlight, for it gleamed, through those seven pillars in the middle, and filled the place with, all colours. And now Mossy saw that there was a pillar beside the red, one, which he had not observed before. And it was of the same new, colour that he had seen in the rainbow when he saw it first in the, fairy forest. And on it he saw a sparkle of blue. It was the sapphires, round the key-hole.\\n\\nOne day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest. These forests, are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers, like a, sieve that keeps back the bran. Then the princes get away to follow, their fortunes. In this they have the advantage of the princesses, who, are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun. I wish our, princesses got lost in a forest sometimes.\\n\\nThe giant caught up the broom, and seeing nothing under it, set it down, again with a force that threw them both on the floor. He then made two, strides to the boys, caught the dough-faced one by the neck, took the, lid off a great pot that was boiling on the fire, popped him in as if, he had been a trussed chicken, put the lid on again, and saying\\n\\nHe tried the key. It fitted. It turned. A great clang and clash, as of, iron bolts on huge brazen caldrons, echoed thunderously within. He drew, out the key. The rock in front of him began to fall. He retreated from, it as far as the breadth of the platform would allow. A great slab fell, at his feet. In front was still the solid rock, with this one slab, fallen forward out of it. But the moment he stepped upon it, a second, fell, just short of the edge of the first, making the next step of a, stair, which thus kept dropping itself before him as he ascended into, the heart of the precipice. It led him into a hall fit for such an, approach--irregular and rude in formation, but floor, sides, pillars\\n\\nNo sooner was she undressed and lying in the bath, than she began to, feel as if the water were sinking into her, and she were receiving all, the good of sleep without undergoing its forgetfulness. She felt the, good coming all the time. And she grew happier and more hopeful than, she had been since she lost Mossy. But she could not help thinking how, very sad it was for a poor old man to live there all alone, and have to, take care of a whole seaful of stupid and riotous fishes.\\n\\nhave an exceeding dislike to untidiness. Indeed, they are quite, spiteful to slovenly people. Being used to all the lovely ways of the, trees and flowers, and to the neatness of the birds and all woodland, creatures, it makes them feel miserable, even in their deep woods and, on their grassy carpets, to think that within the same moonlight lies a, dirty, uncomfortable, slovenly house. And this makes them angry with, the people that live in it, and they would gladly drive them out of the, world if they could. They want the whole earth nice and clean. So they, pinch the maids black and blue, and play them all manner of, uncomfortable tricks.\\n\\nThe king ordered out his guards, and gave directions to the officers to, find the hole in the lake at once. So the bed of the lake was marked, out in divisions and thoroughly examined, and in an hour or so the hole, was discovered. It was in the middle of a stone, near the centre of the, lake, in the very pool where the golden plate had been found. It was a, three-cornered hole of no great size. There was water all round the, stone, but very little was flowing through the hole.\\n\\nBut the princess did not heed the lake. She lay on the floor and wept., And this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of, doors. For when it abated a little, and she proceeded to rise, she, found, to her astonishment, that she could not. At length, after many, efforts, she succeeded in getting upon her feet. But she tumbled down, again directly. Hearing her fall, her old nurse uttered a yell of, delight, and ran to her, screaming,--\\n\\nsent some straggling trees into it. The forest lay to the east, and the, sun, which was setting behind the cottage, looked straight into the, dark wood with his level red eye. The trees were all old, and had few, branches below, so that the sun could see a great way into the forest;, and the boy, being keen-sighted, could see almost as far as the sun., The trunks stood like rows of red columns in the shine of the red sun\\n\\nSo he went the next morning to the house of the princess, and, making a, very humble apology, begged her to undo the spell. But the princess, declared, with a grave face, that she knew nothing at all about it. Her, eyes, however, shone pink, which was a sign that she was happy. She, advised the king and queen to have patience, and to mend their ways., The king returned disconsolate. The queen tried to comfort him.\\n\\nsoothingly. \\\"The great she-eagle has got it for a nest egg. She sits on, it night and day, and thinks she will bring the greatest eagle out of, it that ever sharpened his beak on the rocks of Mount Skycrack. I can, warrant no one else will touch it while she has got it. But she is, rather capricious, and I confess I am not easy about it; for the least, scratch of one of her claws would do for me at once. And she, _has_ claws.\\\"\\n\\nShe let it go, left it hanging, and sat down on a great stone, with her, black cat, which had followed her all round the cave, by her side. Then, she began to knit and mutter awful words. The snake hung like a huge, leech, sucking at the stone; the cat stood with his back arched, and, his tail like a piece of cable, looking up at the snake; and the old, woman sat and knitted and muttered. Seven days and seven nights they, remained thus; when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if, exhausted, and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried, seaweed. The witch started to her feet, picked it up, put it in her, pocket, and looked up at the roof. One drop of water was trembling on, the spot where the snake had been sucking. As soon as she saw that, she, turned and fled, followed by her cat. Shutting the door in a terrible, hurry, she locked it, and having muttered some frightful words, sped to, the next, which also she locked and muttered over; and so with all the, hundred doors, till she arrived in her own cellar. There she sat down, on the floor ready to faint, but listening with malicious delight to, the rushing of the water, which she could hear distinctly through all, the hundred doors.\\n\\nThe consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting, for, the thousandth time, each his favourite theories. For the condition of, the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every, question arising from the division of thought--in fact, of all the, Metaphysics of the Chinese Empire. But it is only justice to say that, they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical, question, _what was to be done_.\\n\\nI may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run, if her mode, of progression could properly be called running. For first she would, make a bound; then, having alighted, she would run a few steps, and, make another bound. Sometimes she would fancy she had reached the, ground before she actually had, and her feet would go backwards and, forwards, running upon nothing at all, like those of a chicken on its, back. Then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun; only in her, laugh there was something missing. What it was, I find myself unable to, describe. I think it was a certain tone, depending upon the possibility, of sorrow--_morbidezza_, perhaps. She never smiled.\\n\\n, One fine summer day, a month after these her first adventures, during, which time she had been very carefully watched, the princess was lying, on the bed in the queen's own chamber, fast asleep. One of the windows, was open, for it was noon, and the day so sultry that the little girl, was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself. The queen, came into the room, and not observing that the baby was on the bed\\n\\nThe children rose at once, and climbing as well as they could, reached, the spider's nest in the centre of the web. Nor did they find it very, difficult; for whenever too great a gap came, the spider spinning a, strong cord stretched it just where they would have chosen to put their, feet next. He left them in his nest, after bringing them two enormous, honey-bags, taken from bees that he had caught; but presently about six, of the wisest of the spiders came back with him. It was rather horrible, to look up and see them all round the mouth of the nest, looking down, on them in contemplation, as if wondering whether they would be nice, eating. At length one of them said,--\\\"Tell us truly what you want with, the eagle, and we will try to help you.\\\"\\n\\nThey all thought she had lost her wits, and was repeating some foolish, nursery rhyme; but a shudder went through the whole of them, notwithstanding. The baby, on the contrary, began to laugh and crow;, while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry, for she thought she, was struck with paralysis: she could not feel the baby in her arms. But, she clasped it tight and said nothing.\\n\\nWhen she came to herself, she found herself gliding down fast and deep., Her head was under water, but that did not signify, for, when she, thought about it, she could not remember that she had breathed once, since her bath in the cave of the Old Man of the Sea. When she lifted, up her head a sudden and fierce heat struck her, and she sank it again, instantly, and went sweeping on.\\n\\nher custom was to catch up a stone in each hand, so that she might come, down again after a bound. Whatever she wore as part of her attire had, no effect in this way: even gold, when it thus became as it were a part, of herself, lost all its weight for the time. But whatever she only, held in her hands retained its downward tendency. On this occasion she, could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad, that was walking across, the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in. Not knowing what, disgust meant, for this was one of her peculiarities, she snatched up, the toad and bounded away. She had almost reached her father, and he, was holding out his arms to receive her, and take from her lips the, kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud, when a puff, of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page, who had just been, receiving a message from his Majesty. Now it was no great peculiarity, in the princess that, once she was set agoing, it always cost her time, and trouble to check herself. On this occasion there was no time. She, _must_ kiss--and she kissed the page. She did not mind it much; for she, had no shyness in her composition; and she knew, besides, that she, could not help it. So she only laughed, like a musical box. The poor, page fared the worst. For the princess, trying to correct the, unfortunate tendency of the kiss, put out her hands to keep her off the, page; so that, along with the kiss, he received, on the other cheek, a, slap with the huge black toad, which she poked right into his eye. He, tried to laugh, too, but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion, of countenance, as showed that there was no danger of his pluming, himself on the kiss. As for the king, his dignity was greatly hurt, and, he did not speak to the page for a whole month.\\n\\nBut at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual. Perhaps that, was because a great pleasure spoils laughing. At all events, after, this, the passion of her life was to get into the water, and she was, always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of, it. Summer and winter it was quite the same; only she could not stay so, long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in. Any, day, from morning till evening in summer, she might be descried--a, streak of white in the blue water--lying as still as the shadow of a, cloud, or shooting along like a dolphin; disappearing, and coming up, again far off, just where one did not expect her. She would have been, in the lake of a night, too, if she could have had her way; for the, balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it; and through a shallow, reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water, and no, one would have been any the wiser. Indeed, when she happened to wake in, the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation. But there was the, sad difficulty of getting into it. She had as great a dread of the air, as some children have of the water. For the slightest gust of wind, would blow her away; and a gust might arise in the stillest moment. And, if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of, reaching it, her situation would be dreadfully awkward, irrespective of, the wind; for at best there she would have to remain, suspended in her, night-gown, till she was seen and angled for by someone from the, window.\\n\\nShe then untwined the snake from her body, and held it by the tail high, above her. The hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof, of the cavern, which it was just able to reach. It then began to move, its head backwards and forwards, with a slow oscillating motion, as if, looking for something. At the same moment the witch began to walk round, and round the cavern, coming nearer to the centre every circuit; while, the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she, did over the floor, for she kept holding it up. And still it kept, slowly oscillating. Round and round the cavern they went, ever, lessening the circuit, till at last the snake made a sudden dart, and, clung to the roof with its mouth.\\n\\nSuddenly, far among the trees, as far as the sun could shine, he saw a, glorious thing. It was the end of a rainbow, large and brilliant. He, could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade, beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous, and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before. Only, the spring of the rainbow-arch was visible. He could see nothing of it, above the trees.\\n\\nIt led her gently along till all at once it swam in at a cottage-door., The child followed still. There was a bright fire in the middle of the, floor, upon which stood a pot without a lid, full of water that boiled, and bubbled furiously. The air-fish swam straight to the pot and into, the boiling water, where it lay quiet. A beautiful woman rose from the, opposite side of the fire and came to meet the girl. She took her up in, her arms, and said,--\\n\\n\\\"Oh! then--\\\" began Tricksey-Wee, feeling rather frightened; but before, she could finish her sentence she heard the sound of footsteps very far, apart and very heavy. The next moment, who should come running towards, her, full speed, and as pale as death, but Buffy-Bob. She held out her, arms, and he ran into them. But when she tried to kiss him, she only, kissed the back of his head; for his white face and round eyes were, turned to the door.\\n\\nuneven space lay around them, out of which spread boughs in every, direction, the smallest of them as big as the biggest tree in the, country of common people. Overhead were leaves enough to supply all the, trees they had ever seen. Not much moonlight could come through, but, the leaves would glimmer white in the wind at times. The tree was full, of giant birds. Every now and then, one would sweep through, with a, great noise. But, except an occasional chirp, sounding like a shrill, pipe in a great organ, they made no noise. All at once an owl began to, hoot. He thought he was singing. As soon as he began, other birds, replied, making rare game of him. To their astonishment, the children, found they could understand every word they sang. And what they sang, was something like this:--\\n\\n\\\"I reassert my former assertion,\\\" began Kopy-Keck, with a plunge., \\\"There is not a fault in the princess, body or soul; only they are, wrong put together. Listen to me now, Hum-Drum, and I will tell you in, brief what I think. Don't speak. Don't answer me. I _won't_ hear you, till I have done.-- At that decisive moment, when souls seek their, appointed habitations, two eager souls met, struck, rebounded, lost, their way, and arrived each at the wrong place. The soul of the, princess was one of those, and she went far astray. She does not belong, by rights to this world at all, but to some other planet, probably, Mercury. Her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural, influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal, frame. She cares for nothing here. There is no relation between her and, this world.\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said the prince; and, catching her up in his arms, he, sprang with her from the rock. The princess had just time to give one, delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them. When, they came to the surface, she found that, for a moment or two, she, could not even laugh, for she had gone down with such a rush, that it, was with difficulty she recovered her breath. The instant they reached, the surface--\\n\\nThe owl spread out his silent, soft, sly wings, and lighting between, Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob, nearly smothered them, closing up one under, each wing. It was like being buried in a down bed. But the owl did not, like anything between his sides and his wings, so he opened his wings, again, and the children made haste to get out. Tricksey-Wee immediately, went in front of the bird, and looking up into his huge face, which was, as round as the eyes of the giantess's spectacles, and much bigger\\n\\nhowever, she could not see much, because of the ivy and other creeping, plants which had straggled across her window. All at once she saw an, ape making faces at her out of the mirror, and the heads carved upon a, great old wardrobe grinning fearfully. Then two old spider-legged, chairs came forward into the middle of the room, and began to dance a, queer, old-fashioned dance. This set her laughing, and she forgot the, ape and the grinning heads. So the fairies saw they had made a mistake\\n\\nThe prince took off his scarf, then his sword-belt, then his tunic, and, tied them all together, and let them down. But the line was far too, short. He unwound his turban, and added it to the rest, when it was all, but long enough; and his purse completed it. The princess just managed, to lay hold of the knot of money, and was beside him in a moment. This, rock was much higher than the other, and the splash and the dive were, tremendous. The princess was in ecstasies of delight, and their swim, was delicious.\\n\\nShe hurried out, and fell, tired and happy, upon the yellow sand of the, shore. There she lay, half asleep with weariness and rest, listening to, the low plash and retreat of the tiny waves, which seemed ever enticing, the land to leave off being land, and become sea. And as she lay, her, eyes were fixed upon the foot of a great rainbow standing far away, against the sky on the other side of the sea. At length she fell fast, asleep.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! but you might do better than that,\\\" said the spider.--\\\"Now we have, resolved to help you. Here is a little bag of spider-juice. The giants, cannot bear spiders, and this juice is dreadful poison to them. We are, all ready to go up with you, and drive the eagle away. Then you must, put the heart into this other bag, and bring it down with you; for then, the giant will be in your power.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish I hadn't one either,\\\" rejoined the princess; \\\"it is so stupid!, I have a great mind,\\\" she continued, \\\"to play them all a trick. Why, couldn't they leave me alone? They won't trust me in the lake for a, single night!--You see where that green light is burning? That is the, window of my room. Now if you would just swim there with me very, quietly, and when we are all but under the balcony, give me such a, push--_up_ you call it--as you did a little while ago, I should be able, to catch hold of the balcony, and get in at the window; and then they, may look for me till to-morrow morning!\\\"\\n\\n, After a long avoidance of the painful subject, the king and queen, resolved to hold a council of three upon it; and so they sent for the, princess. In she came, sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece, of furniture to another, and put herself at last in an armchair, in a, sitting posture. Whether she could be said to _sit_, seeing she, received no support from the seat of the chair, I do not pretend to, determine.\\n\\nIn his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess;, but as everybody said she was bewitched, he never dreamed that she, could bewitch him. For what indeed could a prince do with a princess, that had lost her gravity? Who could tell what she might not lose next?, She might lose her visibility, or her tangibility; or, in short, the, power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium; so that he, should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive. Of course, he made no further inquiries about her.\\n\\nleaving them clear for such as might follow. Now a wonderful form, half, bird-like half human, would float across on outspread sailing pinions., Anon an exquisite shadow group of gambolling children would be followed, by the loveliest female form, and that again by the grand stride of a, Titanic shape, each disappearing in the surrounding press of shadowy, foliage. Sometimes a profile of unspeakable beauty or grandeur would, appear for a moment and vanish. Sometimes they seemed lovers that, passed linked arm in arm, sometimes father and son, sometimes brothers, in loving contest, sometimes sisters entwined in gracefullest community, of complex form. Sometimes wild horses would tear across, free, or, bestrode by noble shadows of ruling men. But some of the things which, pleased them most they never knew how to describe.\\n\\nas he always kept his word, he was afraid he might have to do the same, to them all; and he did not like boiled boys. He like to eat them, crisp, as radishes, whether forked or not, ought to be eaten. He then, sat down, and asked his wife if his supper was ready. She looked into, the pot, and throwing the boy out with the ladle, as if he had been a, black beetle that had tumbled in and had had the worst of it, answered, that she thought it was. Whereupon he rose to help her; and taking the, pot from the fire, poured the whole contents, bubbling and splashing\\n\\nand sent the chairs back to their places. But they knew that she had, been reading the story of Silverhair all day. So the next moment she, heard the voices of the three bears upon the stair, big voice, middle, voice, and little voice, and she heard their soft, heavy tread, as if, they had had stockings over their boots, coming nearer and nearer to, the door of her room, till she could bear it no longer. She did just as, Silverhair did, and as the fairies wanted her to do: she darted to the, window, pulled it open, got upon the ivy, and so scrambled to the, ground. She then fled to the forest as fast as she could run.\\n\\nEvery one ran to the queen's room. But the queen could give no orders., They soon found out, however, that the princess was missing, and in a, moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden; and in one minute, more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping, of hands. They had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush, to, which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her, finishing its, mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little, white sleeper. Startled by the noise the servants made, she woke, and\\n\\nTangle followed the serpent. But she could not go far without looking, back at the marvellous child. He stood alone in the midst of the, glowing desert, beside a fountain of red flame that had burst forth at, his feet, his naked whiteness glimmering a pale rosy red in the torrid, fire. There he stood, looking after her, till, from the lengthening, distance, she could see him no more. The serpent went straight on\\n\\n, The princess burst into a passion of tears, and _fell_ on the floor., There she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased. All the pent-up, crying of her life was spent now. And a rain came on, such as had never, been seen in that country. The sun shone all the time, and the great, drops, which fell straight to the earth, shone likewise. The palace was, in the heart of a rainbow. It was a rain of rubies, and sapphires, and, emeralds, and topazes. The torrents poured from the mountains like, molten gold; and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet, the, lake would have overflowed and inundated the country. It was full from, shore to shore.\\n\\nNow, although she did not know it, this was the very best way she could, have gone; for nothing is ever so mischievous in its own place as it is, out of it; and, besides, these mischievous creatures were only the, children of Fairyland, as it were, and there are many other beings, there as well; and if a wanderer gets in among them, the good ones will, always help him more than the evil ones will be able to hurt him.\\n\\nNow at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese, philosophers--by name, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck. For them the king sent;, and straightway they came. In a long speech he communicated to them, what they knew very well already--as who did not?--namely, the peculiar, condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt;, and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause, and probable cure of her _infirmity_. The king laid stress upon the, word, but failed to discover his own pun. The queen laughed; but, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck heard with humility and retired in silence.\\n\\nHe did not speak again. The princess gave him some wine for the last, time: he was past eating. Then she sat down again, and looked at him., The water rose and rose. It touched his chin. It touched his lower lip., It touched between his lips. He shut them hard to keep it out. The, princess began to feel strange. It touched his upper lip. He breathed, through his nostrils. The princess looked wild. It covered his, nostrils. Her eyes looked scared, and shone strange in the moonlight., His head fell back; the water closed over it, and the bubbles of his, last breath bubbled up through the water. The princess gave a shriek\\n\\nwith her face bowed upon her knees. Seven years had she sat there, waiting. She lifted her head as Mossy drew near. It was Tangle. Her, hair had grown to her feet, and was rippled like the windless sea on, broad sands. Her face was beautiful, like her grandmother's, and as, still and peaceful as that of the Old Man of the Fire. Her form was, tall and noble. Yet Mossy knew her at once.\\n\\n\\\"She will die if I don't do it, and life would be nothing to me without, her; so I shall lose nothing by doing it. And life will be as pleasant, to her as ever, for she will soon forget me. And there will be so much, more beauty and happiness in the world!--To be sure, I shall not see, it.\\\" (Here the poor prince gave a sigh.) \\\"How lovely the lake will be, in the moonlight, with that glorious creature sporting in it like a, wild goddess!--It is rather hard to be drowned by inches, though. Let, me see--that will be seventy inches of me to drown.\\\" (Here he tried to, laugh, but could not.) \\\"The longer the better, however,\\\" he resumed\\n\\nBut how was this to be brought about? Therein lay all the, difficulty--to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough. To, make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh. They sent, for a professional beggar; commanded him to prepare his most touching, oracle of woe; helped him, out of the court charade-box, to whatever he, wanted for dressing up, and promised great rewards in the event of his, success. But it was all in vain. She listened to the mendicant artist's, story, and gazed at his marvellous make-up, till she could contain, herself no longer, and went into the most undignified contortions for, relief, shrieking, positively screeching with laughter.\\n\\nOne lovely evening, after wandering about for many days, he found that, he was approaching the outskirts of this forest; for the trees had got, so thin that he could see the sunset through them; and he soon came, upon a kind of heath. Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood;, but by this time it was getting late, and there was nobody in the, fields to direct him.\\n\\nDay after day he held on, and he thought he had no guide. He did not, see how a shining fish under the water directed his steps. He crossed, the sea, and came to a great precipice of rock, up which he could, discover but one path. Nor did this lead him farther than half-way up, the rock, where it ended on a platform. Here he stood and pondered.--It, could not be that the way stopped here, else what was the path for? It, was a rough path, not very plain, yet certainly a path.--He examined, the face of the rock. It was smooth as glass. But as his eyes kept, roving hopelessly over it, something glittered, and he caught sight of, a row of small sapphires. They bordered a little hole in the rock.\\n\\nand took something like an egg from under it. He next drew a long, curved line in the sand with his finger, and laid the egg in it. He, then spoke something Tangle could not understand. The egg broke, a, small snake came out, and, lying in the line in the sand, grew and grew, till he filled it. The moment he was thus full-grown, he began to glide, away, undulating like a sea-wave.\\n\\nAnd if he tried to catch her, she glided from him in an instant, not in, the least afraid of him, but thinking it part of the game not to be, caught. With one push of her foot, she would be floating in the air, above his head; or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and, sideways, like a great butterfly. It happened several times, when her, father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private\\n\\n, Meantime, notwithstanding awkward occurrences, and griefs that she, brought upon her parents, the little princess laughed and grew--not, fat, but plump and tall. She reached the age of seventeen, without, having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney; by rescuing her, from which, a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face., Nor, thoughtless as she was, had she committed anything worse than, laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way. When she was, told, for the sake of experiment, that General Clanrunfort was cut to, pieces with all his troops, she laughed; when she heard that the enemy, was on his way to besiege her papa's capital, she laughed hugely; but, when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the, mercy of the enemy's soldiery--why, then she laughed immoderately. She, never could be brought to see the serious side of anything. When her, mother cried, she said,--\\n\\nSo he lay down on the ground, and about him on every side, and over his, head, was the constant play of the wonderful shadows. He could look, through them, and see the one behind the other, till they mixed in a, mass of darkness. Tangle, too, lay admiring, and wondering, and longing, after the country whence the shadows came. When they were rested they, rose and pursued their journey.\\n\\nSo she put on her best gown, went to the palace, was kindly received by, the happy monarch, who forgot that he had forgotten her, and took her, place in the procession to the royal chapel. When they were all, gathered about the font, she contrived to get next to it, and throw, something into the water; after which she maintained a very respectful, demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face. But at that, moment she turned round in her place three times, and muttered the, following words, loud enough for those beside her to hear:--\\n\\nWhen he woke in the morning the sun was looking straight into his eyes., He turned away from it, and the same moment saw a brilliant little, thing lying on the moss within a foot of his face. It was the golden, key. The pipe of it was of plain gold, as bright as gold could be. The, handle was curiously wrought and set with sapphires. In a terror of, delight he put out his hand and took it, and had it.\\n\\nThe king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to, cool, and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man, who was willing to be useful in the present emergency, seeing that in, the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his, majesty's own hand. \\\"Oh!\\\" said he at last, putting up his sword with, difficulty, it was so long; \\\"I am obliged to you, you young fool! Take, a glass of wine?\\\"\\n\\ntill he could not bear it any longer, and gave her a box on the ear., Tricksey-Wee cried; and Buffy-Bob was so sorry and so ashamed of, himself that he cried too, and ran off into the wood. He was so long, gone that Tricksey-Wee began to be frightened, for she was very fond of, her brother; and she was so distressed that she had first teased him, and then cried, that at last she ran into the wood to look for him\\n\\n\\\"I will leave it a month longer where it is, and then I will give it to, the Queen of the Kangaroos, and she will carry it in her pouch for me., It is best to change its place, you know, lest my enemies should scent, it out. But, dear Doodlem, it's a fretting care to have a heart of, one's own to look after. The responsibility is too much for me. If it, were not for a bite of a radish now and then, I never could bear it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She must therefore be taught, by the sternest compulsion, to take an, interest in the earth as the earth. She must study every department of, its history--its animal history; its vegetable history; its mineral, history; its social history; its moral history; its political history;, its scientific history; its literary history; its musical history; its, artistical history; above all, its metaphysical history. She must begin, with the Chinese dynasty and end with Japan. But first of all she must, study geology, and especially the history of the extinct races of, animals--their natures, their habits, their loves, their hates, their, revenges. She must--\\\"\\n\\nWhen he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave, he saw the, princess already floating about in the lake, attended by the king or, queen--whom he knew by their crowns--and a great company in lovely, little boats, with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow, and, flags and streamers of a great many more. It was a very bright day, and, soon the prince, burned up with the heat, began to long for the cold, water and the cool princess. But he had to endure till twilight; for, the boats had provisions on board, and it was not till the sun went, down that the gay party began to vanish. Boat after boat drew away to, the shore, following that of the king and queen, till only one\\n\\nBut so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair, trial, that he put himself in a rage one day, and, rushing up to her, room, gave her an awful whipping. Yet not a tear would flow. She looked, grave, and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming--that was, all. The good old tyrant, though he put on his best gold spectacles to, look, could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her, eyes.\\n\\nShe took Tangle on her knee, and began to sing to her--such songs as, made her wish she could listen to them for ever. But at length in, rushed the shining fish, and snuggled down in the pot. It was followed, by a youth who had outgrown his worn garments. His face was ruddy with, health, and in his hand he carried a little jewel, which sparkled in, the firelight.\\n\\nAs evening grew on, the shadows fell deeper and rose higher. At length, they reached a place where they rose above their heads, and made all, dark around them. Then they took hold of each other's hand, and walked, on in silence and in some dismay. They felt the gathering darkness, and, something strangely solemn besides, and the beauty of the shadows, ceased to delight them. All at once Tangle found that she had not a, hold of Mossy's hand, though when she lost it she could not tell.\\n\\nstaring, and forgetting to get out. But the princess disappearing, he, scrambled on shore, and went in the direction of the tree. There he, found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem. But in, the darkness of the wood, the prince continued in some bewilderment as, to what the phenomenon could be; until, reaching the ground, and seeing, him standing there, she caught hold of him, and said,--\\n\\nNow it does not generally matter if somebody _is_ forgotten, only you, must mind who. Unfortunately, the king forgot without intending to, forget; and so the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit, which was, awkward. For the princess was the king's own sister; and he ought not, to have forgotten her. But she had made herself so disagreeable to the, old king, their father, that he had forgotten her in making his will;, and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his, invitations. But poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind, of them. Why don't they? The king could not see into the garret she, lived in, could he?\\n\\nHe stood gazing at it till he forgot himself with delight--even forgot, the key which he had come to seek. And as he stood it grew more, wonderful still. For in each of the colours, which was as large as the, column of a church, he could faintly see beautiful forms slowly, ascending as if by the steps of a winding stair. The forms appeared, irregularly--now one, now many, now several, now none--men and women, and children--all different, all beautiful.\\n\\nThe fish was out of the door in a moment. Then the lady told Tangle it, was time to go to bed; and, opening another door in the side of the, cottage, showed her a little arbour, cool and green, with a bed of, purple heath growing in it, upon which she threw a large wrapper made, of the feathered skins of the wise fishes, shining gorgeous in the, firelight.\\n\\nTangle now remarked that the lid was on the pot. But the lady took no, further notice of it till they had eaten the fish, which Tangle found, nicer than any fish she had ever tasted before. It was as white as, snow, and as delicate as cream. And the moment she had swallowed a, mouthful of it, a change she could not describe began to take place in, her. She heard a murmuring all about her, which became more and more, articulate, and at length, as she went on eating, grew intelligible. By, the time she had finished her share, the sounds of all the animals in, the forest came crowding through the door to her ears; for the door, still stood wide open, though it was pitch dark outside; and they were, no longer sounds only; they were speech, and speech that she could, understand. She could tell what the insects in the cottage were saying, to each other too. She had even a suspicion that the trees and flowers, all about the cottage were holding midnight communications with each, other; but what they said she could not hear.\\n\\non to the she-eagle, and buried themselves in her feathers. In a moment, she became very restless, and went pecking about with her beak. All at, once she spread out her wings, with a sound like a whirlwind, and flew, off to bathe in the sea; and then the spiders began to drop from her in, all directions on their gossamer wings. The children had to hold fast, to keep the wind of the eagle's flight from blowing them off. As soon, as it was over, they looked into the nest, and there lay the giant's, heart--an awful and ugly thing.\\n\\nAnd the king said to himself, \\\"All the queens of my acquaintance have, children, some three, some seven, and some as many as twelve; and my, queen has not one. I feel ill-used.\\\" So he made up his mind to be cross, with his wife about it. But she bore it all like a good patient queen, as she was. Then the king grew very cross indeed. But the queen, pretended to take it all as a joke, and a very good one too.\\n\\n, The princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion, and she, could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour. Imagine then her, consternation, when, diving with the prince one night, a sudden, suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be., The prince could not imagine what had happened. She shot to the, surface, and, without a word, swam at full speed towards the higher, side of the lake. He followed, begging to know if she was ill, or what, was the matter. She never turned her head, or took the smallest notice, of his question. Arrived at the shore, she coasted the rocks with, minute inspection. But she was not able to come to a conclusion, for, the moon was very small, and so she could not see well. She turned, therefore and swam home, without saying a word to explain her conduct, to the prince, of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious. He, withdrew to his cave, in great perplexity and distress.\\n\\nWhen the strange fact came to be known, there was a terrible commotion, in the palace. The occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally, a repetition of the nurse's experience. Astonished that he felt no, weight when the child was laid in his arms, he began to wave her up, and--not down, for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before, and, there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction, as was, testified by her peals of tiny laughter. The king stood staring up in, speechless amazement, and trembled so that his beard shook like grass, in the wind. At last, turning to the queen, who was just as, horror-struck as himself, he said, gasping, staring, and stammering,--\\n\\nBut this house was quite a shame, and the fairies in the forest could, not endure it. They tried everything on the maids without effect, and, at last resolved upon making a clean riddance, beginning with the, child. They ought to have known that it was not her fault, but they, have little principle and much mischief in them, and they thought that, if they got rid of her the maids would be sure to be turned away.\\n\\n, Never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the, prince had a single interview with her. He had seen her once or twice, in the lake; but as far as he could discover, she had not been in it, any more at night. He had sat and sung, and looked in vain for his, Nereid; while she, like a true Nereid, was wasting away with her lake\\n\\nThen she went to an old chest in the room, and opening it, took out, what looked like a piece of dried seaweed. This she threw into a tub of, water. Then she threw some powder into the water, and stirred it with, her bare arm, muttering over it words of hideous sound, and yet more, hideous import. Then she set the tub aside, and took from the chest a, huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys, that clattered in her shaking, hands. Then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all. Before she had, finished, out from the tub, the water of which had kept on a slow, motion ever since she had ceased stirring it, came the head and half, the body of a huge gray snake. But the witch did not look round. It, grew out of the tub, waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow, horizontal motion, till it reached the princess, when it laid its head, upon her shoulder, and gave a low hiss in her ear. She started--but, with joy; and seeing the head resting on her shoulder, drew it towards, her and kissed it. Then she drew it all out of the tub, and wound it, round her body. It was one of those dreadful creatures which few have, ever beheld--the White Snakes of Darkness.\\n\\nThe moment she looked in his face, she saw that he was a youth of, marvellous beauty. He sat entranced with the delight of what he beheld, in a mirror of something like silver, which lay on the floor at his, feet, and which from behind she had taken for his white beard. He sat, on, heedless of her presence, pale with the joy of his vision. She, stood and watched him. At length, all trembling, she spoke. But her, voice made no sound. Yet the youth lifted up his head. He showed no, surprise, however, at seeing her--only smiled a welcome.\\n\\nNo sooner was the heart out of the bag, than it expanded to the size of, a bullock; and the giant, with a yell of rage and vengeance, rushed on, the two children, who had stepped sideways from the terrible heart. But, Buffy-Bob was too quick for Thunderthump. He sprang to the heart, and, buried his knife in it, up to the hilt. A fountain of blood spouted, from it; and with a dreadful groan the giant fell dead at the feet of, little Tricksey-Wee, who could not help being sorry for him after all.\\n\\nand with their wet feathers washed her quite clean. Then the lady, who, had been looking on all the time, spoke again; whereupon some thirty or, forty of the fishes rose out of the water underneath Tangle, and so, bore her up to the arms the lady held out to take her. She carried her, back to the fire, and, having dried her well, opened a chest, and, taking out the finest linen garments, smelling of grass and lavender\\n\\nAs soon as the fish was eaten, the lady went to the fire and took the, lid off the pot. A lovely little creature in human shape, with large, white wings, rose out of it, and flew round and round the roof of the, cottage; then dropped, fluttering, and nestled in the lap of the lady., She spoke to it some strange words, carried it to the door, and threw, it out into the darkness. Tangle heard the flapping of its wings die, away in the distance.\\n\\nShe took off the girl's night-gown, rose with her in her arms, and, going to the wall of the cottage, opened a door. Then Tangle saw a deep, tank, the sides of which were filled with green plants, which had, flowers of all colours. There was a roof over it like the roof of the, cottage. It was filled with beautiful clear water, in which swam a, multitude of such fishes as the one that had led her to the cottage. It, was the light their colours gave that showed the place in which they, were.\\n\\nNext day she made many observations, which, alas! strengthened her, fears. She saw that the banks were too dry; and that the grass on the, shore, and the trailing plants on the rocks, were withering away. She, caused marks to be made along the borders, and examined them, day after, day, in all directions of the wind; till at last the horrible idea, became a certain fact--that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking.\\n\\nlost his hold of his daughter; not, however, before imparting to her, the downward tendency of his own person, though in a somewhat different, direction; for, as the king fell into the boat, she fell into the, water. With a burst of delightful laughter she disappeared in the lake., A cry of horror ascended from the boats. They had never seen the, princess go down before. Half the men were under water in a moment; but, they had all, one after another, come up to the surface again for, breath, when--tinkle, tinkle, babble, and gush! came the princess's, laugh over the water from far away. There she was, swimming like a, swan. Nor would she come out for king or queen, chancellor or daughter., She was perfectly obstinate.\\n\\ndrying up within her, first to mud, then to madness and death. She thus, brooded over the change, with all its dreadful accompaniments, till she, was nearly distracted. As for the prince, she had forgotten him., However much she had enjoyed his company in the water, she did not care, for him without it. But she seemed to have forgotten her father and, mother too. The lake went on sinking. Small slimy spots began to, appear, which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the, water. These grew to broad patches of mud, which widened and spread\\n\\nHe drew nearer to the rainbow. It vanished. He started back a step in, dismay. It was there again, as beautiful as ever. So he contented, himself with standing as near it as he might, and watching the forms, that ascended the glorious colours towards the unknown height of the, arch, which did not end abruptly, but faded away in the blue air, so, gradually that he could not say where it ceased.\\n\\nAt last they came to the foot of Mount Skycrack. It stood in a plain, alone, and shot right up, I don't know how many thousand feet, into the, air, a long, narrow, spearlike mountain. The whole face of it, from top, to bottom, was covered with a network of spiders' webs, with threads of, various sizes, from that of silk to that of whipcord. The webs shook, and quivered, and waved in the sun, glittering like silver. All about, ran huge greedy spiders, catching huge silly flies, and devouring them.\\n\\nSo the children went on because they did not know what else to do. They, found the way very rough and difficult, the tree was so full of humps, and hollows. Now and then they plashed into a pool of rain; now and, then they came upon twigs growing out of the trunk where they had no, business, and they were as large as full-grown poplars. Sometimes they, came upon great cushions of soft moss, and on one of them they lay down, and rested. But they had not lain long before they spied a large, nightingale sitting on a branch, with its bright eyes looking up at the, moon. In a moment more he began to sing, and the birds about him began, to reply, but in a different tone from that in which they had replied, to the owl. Oh, the birds did call the nightingale such pretty names!, The nightingale sang, and the birds replied like this:--\\n\\nLooking down, they could not tell whether the valley below was a grassy, plain or a great still lake. They had never seen any space look like, it. The way to it was difficult and dangerous, but down the narrow path, they went, and reached the bottom in safety. They found it composed of, smooth, light-coloured sandstone, undulating in parts, but mostly, level. It was no wonder to them now that they had not been able to tell, what it was, for this surface was everywhere crowded with shadows. The, mass was chiefly made up of the shadows of leaves innumerable, of all, lovely and imaginative forms, waving to and fro, floating and quivering, in the breath of a breeze whose motion was unfelt, whose sound was, unheard. No forests clothed the mountain-sides, no trees were anywhere, to be seen, and yet the shadows of the leaves, branches, and stems of, all various trees covered the valley as far as their eyes could reach., They soon spied the shadows of flowers mingled with those of the, leaves, and now and then the shadow of a bird with open beak, and, throat distended with song. At times would appear the forms of strange\\n\\nWhen the moon came, she brought them fresh pleasure. Everything looked, strange and new in her light, with an old, withered, yet unfading, newness. When the moon was nearly full, one of their great delights, was, to dive deep in the water, and then, turning round, look up, through it at the great blot of light close above them, shimmering and, trembling and wavering, spreading and contracting, seeming to melt, away, and again grow solid. Then they would shoot up through the blot;, and lo! there was the moon, far off, clear and steady and cold, and, very lovely, at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs, as, the princess said.\\n\\nWhen the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her, she was, so transported that she jumped off the bed, feeble as she was, and, danced about the room for joy. She did not care who the man was; that, was nothing to her. The hole wanted stopping; and if only a man would, do, why, take one. In an hour or two more everything was ready. Her, maid dressed her in haste, and they carried her to the side of the, lake. When she saw it she shrieked, and covered her face with her, hands. They bore her across to the stone, where they had already placed, a little boat for her. The water was not deep enough to float it, but, they hoped it would be, before long. They laid her on cushions, placed, in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things, and stretched a, canopy over all.\\n\\n\\\"Hold, h-o-o-old!\\\" roared Hum-Drum. \\\"It is certainly my turn now. My, rooted and insubvertible conviction is, that the causes of the, anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely, physical. But that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist., Hear my opinion.--From some cause or other, of no importance to our, inquiry, the motion of her heart has been reversed. That remarkable, combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way--I, mean in the case of the princess: it draws in where it should force, out, and forces out where it should draw in. The offices of the, auricles and the ventricles are subverted. The blood is sent forth by, the veins, and returns by the arteries. Consequently it is running the, wrong way through all her corporeal organism--lungs and all. Is it then, at all mysterious, seeing that such is the case, that on the other, particular of gravitation as well, she should differ from normal, humanity? My proposal for the cure is this:--\\n\\nBut this was not enough. Now that she had tasted revenge, she lost her, patience. Without further measures, the lake would be too long in, disappearing. So the next night, with the last shred of the dying old, moon rising, she took some of the water in which she had revived the, snake, put it in a bottle, and set out, accompanied by her cat. Before, morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake, muttering fearful, words as she crossed every stream, and casting into it some of the, water out of her bottle. When she had finished the circuit she muttered, yet again, and flung a handful of water towards the moon. Thereupon, every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble, dying away like, the pulse of a dying man. The next day there was no sound of falling, water to be heard along the borders of the lake. The very courses were, dry; and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides., And not alone had the fountains of mother Earth ceased to flow; for all, the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully--only without, tears.\\n\\nGradually the stream grew shallower. At length she could hardly keep, her head under. Then the water could carry her no farther. She rose, from the channel, and went step for step down the burning descent. The, water ceased altogether. The heat was terrible. She felt scorched to, the bone, but it did not touch her strength. It grew hotter and hotter., She said, \\\"I can bear it no longer.\\\" Yet she went on.\\n\\nand crossing it, unlocked another door into a dark, narrow passage. She, locked this also behind her, and descended a few more steps. If anyone, had followed the witch-princess, he would have heard her unlock exactly, one hundred doors, and descend a few steps after unlocking each. When, she had unlocked the last, she entered a vast cave, the roof of which, was supported by huge natural pillars of rock. Now this roof was the, under side of the bottom of the lake.\\n\\nSo Tricksey took her bag, and squeezed a drop out of it upon the heart., She thought she heard the giant give a far-off roar of pain, and she, nearly fell from her seat with terror. The heart instantly began to, shrink. It shrunk and shrivelled till it was nearly gone; and Buffy-Bob, caught it up and put it into his bag. Then the two spiders turned and, went down again as fast as they could. Before they got to the bottom\\n\\nThere was such an awfulness of absolute repose on the face of the child, that Tangle stood dumb before him. He had no smile, but the love in his, large gray eyes was deep as the centre. And with the repose there lay, on his face a shimmer as of moonlight, which seemed as if any moment it, might break into such a ravishing smile as would cause the beholder to, weep himself to death. But the smile never came, and the moonlight lay, there unbroken. For the heart of the child was too deep for any smile, to reach from it to his face.\\n\\nwithout looking up, or seeming to know that there was a stranger in his, deep-withdrawn cell. Diligently as a lace-maker shifts her bobbins, he, shifted and arranged his balls. Flashes of meaning would now pass from, them to Tangle, and now again all would be not merely obscure, but, utterly dark. She stood looking for a long time, for there was, fascination in the sight; and the longer she looked the more an, indescribable vague intelligence went on rousing itself in her mind., For seven years she had stood there watching the naked child with his, coloured balls, and it seemed to her like seven hours, when all at once, the shape the balls took, she knew not why, reminded her of the Valley, of Shadows, and she spoke:--\\n\\nexcept for the great fire that was burning there, diminished to a spark, in the distance. Towards this fire she ran as fast as she could, and, was not far from it when something fell before her with a great, clatter, over which she tumbled, and went rolling on the floor. She was, not much hurt however, and got up in a moment. Then she saw that what, she had fallen over was not unlike a great iron bucket. When she, examined it more closely, she discovered that it was a thimble; and, looking up to see who had dropped it, beheld a huge face, with, spectacles as big as the round windows in a church, bending over her\\n\\nthat the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down, she flew, from her arms towards the ceiling. Happily, the resistance of the air, brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it. There she, remained, horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms, kicking and, laughing amazingly. The nurse in terror flew to the bell, and begged, the footman, who answered it, to bring up the house-steps directly., Trembling in every limb, she climbed upon the steps, and had to stand, upon the very top, and reach up, before she could catch the floating, tail of the baby's long clothes.\\n\\nAnd moving a slide in the wall of his house, he first looked out, and, then tapped upon a thick piece of crystal that filled the round, opening. Tangle came up behind him, and peeping through the window into, the heart of the great deep green ocean, saw the most curious, creatures, some very ugly, all very odd, and with especially queer, mouths, swimming about everywhere, above and below, but all coming, towards the window in answer to the tap of the Old Man of the Sea. Only, a few could get their mouths against the glass; but those who were, floating miles away yet turned their heads towards it. The old man, looked through the whole flock carefully for some minutes, and then, turning to Tangle, said,--\\n\\nShe laid hold first of one leg, and then of the other, and pulled and, tugged, but she could not move either. She stopped to take breath, and, that made her think that he could not get any breath. She was frantic., She got hold of him, and held his head above the water, which was, possible now his hands were no longer on the hole. But it was of no, use, for he was past breathing.\\n\\nI refer anyone who doubts this part of my story to certain chronicles, of Giantland preserved among the Celtic nations. It was quite a common, thing for a giant to put his heart out to nurse, because he did not, like the trouble and responsibility of doing it himself; although I, must confess it was a dangerous sort of plan to take, especially with, such a delicate viscus as the heart.\\n\\nShe spent that day in the wood, listening to the birds and beasts and, creeping things. She understood all that they said, though she could, not repeat a word of it; and every kind had a different language, while, there was a common though more limited understanding between all the, inhabitants of the forest. She saw nothing of the beautiful lady, but, she felt that she was near her all the time; and she took care not to, go out of sight of the cottage. It was round, like a snow-hut or a, wigwam; and she could see neither door nor window in it. The fact was\\n\\nand damp. A little stream spouted from a rent in the rock and fell into, a basin of moss. She plunged her face into it and drank. Then she, lifted her head and looked around. Then she rose and looked again. She, saw no one in the cave. But the moment she stood upright she had a, marvellous sense that she was in the secret of the earth and all its, ways. Everything she had seen, or learned from books; all that her, grandmother had said or sung to her; all the talk of the beasts, birds\\n\\n, Her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity. If you, ask me how this was effected, I answer, \\\"In the easiest way in the, world. She had only to destroy gravitation.\\\" For the princess was a, philosopher, and knew all the _ins_ and _outs_ of the laws of, gravitation as well as the _ins_ and _outs_ of her boot-lace. And being, a witch as well, she could abrogate those laws in a moment; or at least, so clog their wheels and rust their bearings, that they would not work, at all. But we have more to do with what followed than with how it was, done.\\n\\nShe was standing at the foot of a tree in the twilight, listening to a, quarrel between a mole and a squirrel, in which the mole told the, squirrel that the tail was the best of him, and the squirrel called the, mole Spade-fists, when, the darkness having deepened around her, she, became aware of something shining in her face, and looking round, saw, that the door of the cottage was open, and the red light of the fire, flowing from it like a river through the darkness. She left Mole and, Squirrel to settle matters as they might, and darted off to the, cottage. Entering, she found the pot boiling on the fire, and the, grand, lovely lady sitting on the other side of it.\\n\\nAt last there was not one step more, and she found herself in a, glimmering cave. On a stone in the middle of it sat a figure with its, back towards her--the figure of an old man bent double with age. From, behind she could see his white beard spread out on the rocky floor in, front of him. He did not move as she entered, so she passed round that, she might stand before him and speak to him.\\n\\nAfter travelling for another hour, his horse, quite worn out with long, labour and lack of food, fell, and was unable to rise again. So he, continued his journey on foot. At length he entered another wood--not a, wild forest, but a civilized wood, through which a footpath led him to, the side of a lake. Along this path the prince pursued his way through, the gathering darkness. Suddenly he paused, and listened. Strange, sounds came across the water. It was, in fact, the princess laughing., Now there was something odd in her laugh, as I have already hinted, for, the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity;, and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming., Looking over the lake, he saw something white in the water; and, in an, instant, he had torn off his tunic, kicked off his sandals, and plunged, in. He soon reached the white object, and found that it was a woman., There was not light enough to show that she was a princess, but quite, enough to show that she was a lady, for it does not want much light to, see that.\\n\\nOne summer evening, during the carnival of the country, she had been, taken upon the lake by the king and queen, in the royal barge. They, were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats., In the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's, barge, for his daughter, who was a great favourite with her, was in it, with her father. Now though the old king rarely condescended to make, light of his misfortune, yet, happening on this occasion to be in a, particularly good humour, as the barges approached each other, he, caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge. He, lost his balance, however, and, dropping into the bottom of the barge\\n\\nThe nightingale sang so sweetly, that the children would have fallen, asleep but for fear of losing any of the song. When the nightingale, stopped they got up and wandered on. They did not know where they were, going, but they thought it best to keep going on, because then they, might come upon something or other. They were very sorry they had, forgotten to ask the nightingale about the eagle's nest, but his music, had put everything else out of their heads. They resolved, however, not, to forget the next time they had a chance. So they went on and on, till, they were both tired, and Tricksey-Wee said at last, trying to laugh,--\\n\\nThe poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had. It was, awful to her to see the lake, which she loved more than any living, thing, lie dying before her eyes. It sank away, slowly vanishing. The, tops of rocks that had never been seen till now, began to appear far, down in the clear water. Before long they were dry in the sun. It was, fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and, festering, full of lovely creatures dying, and ugly creatures coming to, life, like the unmaking of a world. And how hot the sun would be, without any lake! She could not bear to swim in it any more, and began, to pine away. Her life seemed bound up with it; and ever as the lake, sank, she pined. People said she would not live an hour after the lake, was gone.\\n\\nThe only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty, hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her. But she was sorry for, it the very next day, when she heard that the water had undermined her, house, and that it had fallen in the night, burying her in its ruins;, whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body. There she lies to this, day.\\n\\n\\\"Phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety. Let it, be affected, if necessary, in a warm bath. When she is reduced to a, state of perfect asphyxy, apply a ligature to the left ankle, drawing, it as tight as the bone will bear. Apply, at the same moment, another, of equal tension around the right wrist. By means of plates constructed, for the purpose, place the other foot and hand under the receivers of, two air-pumps. Exhaust the receivers. Exhibit a pint of French brandy\\n\\nTricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob peered through the bristles, and discovered, a row of little boys, about a dozen, with very fat faces and goggle, eyes, sitting before the fire, and looking stupidly into it., Thunderthump intended the most of these for pickling, and was feeding, them well before salting them. Now and then, however, he could not keep, his teeth off them, and would eat one by the bye, without salt.\\n\\n\\\"There is no one here but me,\\\" he answered, smiling. \\\"Some people call, me the Old Man of the Sea. Others have another name for me, and are, terribly frightened when they meet me taking a walk by the shore., Therefore I avoid being seen by them, for they are so afraid, that they, never see what I really am. You see me now.--But I must show you the, way to the Old Man of the Earth.\\\"\\n\\nShe was watched more carefully after this, no doubt; yet it would be, endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity, of the young princess. But there never was a baby in a house, not to, say a palace, that kept the household in such constant good-humour, at, least below-stairs. If it was not easy for her nurses to hold her, at, least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache. And she was so, nice to play at ball with! There was positively no danger of letting, her fall. They might throw her down, or knock her down, or push her, down, but couldn't _let_ her down. It is true, they might let her fly, into the fire or the coal-hole, or through the window; but none of, these accidents had happened as yet. If you heard peals of laughter, resounding from some unknown region, you might be sure enough of the, cause. Going down into the kitchen, or _the room_, you would find Jane, and Thomas, and Robert and Susan, all and sum, playing at ball with the, little princess. She was the ball herself, and did not enjoy it the, less for that. Away she went, flying from one to another, screeching, with laughter. And the servants loved the ball itself better even than, the game. But they had to take some care how they threw her, for if she, received an upward direction, she would never come down again without, being fetched.\\n\\nIn the morning she woke to the rustling of leaves over her head, and, the sound of running water. But, to her surprise, she could find no, door--nothing but the moss-grown wall of the cottage. So she crept, through an opening in the arbour, and stood in the forest. Then she, bathed in a stream that ran merrily through the trees, and felt, happier; for having once been in her grandmother's pond, she must be, clean and tidy ever after; and, having put on her green dress, felt, like a lady.\\n\\n, This was a very disheartening revelation to the king--not that he was, unwilling to sacrifice a subject, but that he was hopeless of finding a, man willing to sacrifice himself. No time was to be lost, however, for, the princess was lying motionless on her bed, and taking no nourishment, but lake-water, which was now none of the best. Therefore the king, caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published, throughout the country.\\n\\nAt length the trees grew smaller, and stood farther apart, and the, ground began to rise, and it got more and more steep, till the trees, were all left behind, and the two were climbing a narrow path with, rocks on each side. Suddenly they came upon a rude doorway, by which, they entered a narrow gallery cut in the rock. It grew darker and, darker, till it was pitch-dark, and they had to feel their way. At, length the light began to return, and at last they came out upon a, narrow path on the face of a lofty precipice. This path went winding, down the rock to a wide plain, circular in shape, and surrounded on all, sides by mountains. Those opposite to them were a great way off, and, towered to an awful height, shooting up sharp, blue, ice-enamelled, pinnacles. An utter silence reigned where they stood. Not even the, sound of water reached them.\\n\\nfar away to the north, they saw a huge peak, like the spire of a, church, going right up into the sky. They thought this must be Mount, Skycrack, and turned their faces towards it. As they went on, they saw, a giant or two, now and then, striding about the fields or through the, woods, but they kept out of their way. Nor were they in much danger;, for it was only one or two of the border giants that were so very fond, of children.\\n\\nIt was a long time before she got reconciled to walking. But the pain, of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things, either of which, would have been sufficient consolation. The first was, that the prince, himself was her teacher; and the second, that she could tumble into the, lake as often as she pleased. Still, she preferred to have the prince, jump in with her; and the splash they made before was nothing to the, splash they made now.\\n\\nHe lay for a while, turning it over and over, and feeding his eyes upon, its beauty. Then he jumped to his feet, remembering that the pretty, thing was of no use to him yet. Where was the lock to which the key, belonged? It must be somewhere, for how could anybody be so silly as, make a key for which there was no lock? Where should he go to look for, it? He gazed about him, up into the air, down to the earth, but saw no, keyhole in the clouds, in the grass, or in the trees.\\n\\nafter some trouble, found them again. Then he made the best of his way, round the lake to the other side. There the wood was wilder, and the, shore steeper--rising more immediately towards the mountains which, surrounded the lake on all sides, and kept sending it messages of, silvery streams from morning to night, and all night long. He soon, found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's, room, and where, even in the broad daylight, he would be in no danger, of being discovered from the opposite shore. It was a sort of cave in, the rock, where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves, and lay, down too tired for hunger to keep him awake. All night long he dreamed, that he was swimming with the princess.\\n\\nNow, all that his great-aunt told the boy about the golden key would, have been nonsense, had it not been that their little house stood on, the borders of Fairyland. For it is perfectly well known that out of, Fairyland nobody ever can find where the rainbow stands. The creature, takes such good care of its golden key, always flitting from place to, place, lest anyone should find it! But in Fairyland it is quite, different. Things that look real in this country look very thin indeed, in Fairyland, while some of the things that here cannot stand still for, a moment, will not move there. So it was not in the least absurd of the, old lady to tell her nephew such things about the golden key.\\n\\nand to be a hollow place so great that she could not tell what it was, hollowed out of. Staring at it, she found that it was a doorway; and, going nearer and staring harder, she saw the door, far in, with a, knocker of iron upon it, a great many yards above her head, and as, large as the anchor of a big ship. Now, nobody had ever been unkind to, Tricksey-Wee, and therefore she was not afraid of anybody. For, Buffy-Bob's box on the ear she did not think worth considering. So, spying a little hole at the bottom of the door which had been nibbled, by some giant mouse, she crept through it, and found herself in an, enormous hall. She could not have seen the other end of it at all\\n\\n\\\"If the lake should disappear, they must find the hole through which, the water ran. But it would be useless to try to stop it by any, ordinary means. There was but one effectual mode.--The body of a living, man could alone stanch the flow. The man must give himself of his own, will; and the lake must take his life as it filled. Otherwise the, offering would be of no avail. If the nation could not provide one, hero, it was time it should perish.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so remarkable were its effects upon her, especially in restoring, her for the time to the ordinary human gravity, that Hum-Drum and, Kopy-Keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three, years; in the hope that, as the water did her so much good, the earth, would do her yet more. But the king had some vulgar prejudices against, the experiment, and would not give his consent. Foiled in this, they, yet agreed in another recommendation; which, seeing that the one, imported his opinions from China and the other from Thibet, was very, remarkable indeed. They argued that, if water of external origin and, application could be so efficacious, water from a deeper source might, work a perfect cure; in short, that if the poor afflicted princess, could by any means be made to cry, she might recover her lost gravity.\\n\\n, Perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in, love. But how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is, a difficulty--perhaps _the_ difficulty. As for her own feelings on the, subject, she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey, and stings to be fallen into. But now I come to mention another curious, fact about her.\\n\\nthis king was justified in forgetting his sister, even at a, christening. She looked very odd, too. Her forehead was as large as all, the rest of her face, and projected over it like a precipice. When she, was angry her little eyes flashed blue. When she hated anybody, they, shone yellow and green. What they looked like when she loved anybody, I, do not know; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself, and I, do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got, used to herself. But what made it highly imprudent in the king to, forget her was--that she was awfully clever. In fact, she was a witch;, and when she bewitched anybody, he very soon had enough of it; for she, beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness, and all the clever ones in, cleverness. She despised all the modes we read of in history, in which, offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges; and therefore\\n\\ngraceful creatures, running up and down the shadow-boles and along the, branches, to disappear in the wind-tossed foliage. As they walked they, waded knee-deep in the lovely lake. For the shadows were not merely, lying on the surface of the ground, but heaped up above it like, substantial forms of darkness, as if they had been cast upon a thousand, different planes of the air. Tangle and Mossy often lifted their heads, and gazed upwards to discry whence the shadows came; but they could see, nothing more than a bright mist spread above them, higher than the tops, of the mountains, which stood clear against it. No forests, no leaves\\n\\nIt began to grow dark. And they wanted more than ever to reach the, country whence the shadows fall. So they looked about them for a way, out of the cave. The door by which Mossy entered had closed again, and, there was half a mile of rock between them and the sea. Neither could, Tangle find the opening in the floor by which the serpent had led her, thither. They searched till it grew so dark that they could see, nothing, and gave it up.\\n\\nIt happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the, brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake. It was a, rocky basin of considerable depth. Looking in, they saw at the bottom, something that shone yellow in the sun. A little boy jumped in and, dived for it. It was a plate of gold covered with writing. They carried, it to the king.\",\n          \"The rain now began to fall, and the wind blew with fitful gusts.  He did, not care for either himself, but he was sorry that Jeannette should be, exposed to the storm.  He felt nearly sure that she would come, in spite, of it.  If not, he made up his mind to wait till dark, and then to go on, to her cottage.  There was no great risk in doing so, as the soldiers, would long before this have given up their search for him and Jack.\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry to say that the authorities have heard of your being in the, neighbourhood, and have sent the gendarmes to search for you!\\\" she, exclaimed, in an anxious tone.  \\\"I did not wish to drive you away, and, am willing to try and conceal you.  At present, no one knows you are in, the house.  You may remain in a loft between the ceiling of this room, and the roof, where you are not likely to be found; but the place is, low, and will, I fear, be hot in the daytime, and far from pleasant., Francois might manage to conduct you to a hut in the woods at no great, distance from this, to which we could send you food; but there is the, risk of the person who goes being seen, and your retreat being, discovered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We got the blanket ready.  The first cloud passed by, nearly saturating, the blanket.  The men wrung it out into one of their hats, two or three, sucking at the corners.  They seemed inclined to fight for the small, quantity they had obtained, but did not even offer to give me any.  I, got no water, though the blanket was somewhat cleansed, not that I felt, inclined to be particular.  In a few minutes another shower fell.  Each, of us got an ample supply of water.  My spirits rose in a way I could, not have expected.  For some time I did not suffer from the pangs of, hunger; but they presently returned with greater force than before, and, I guessed how my companions were feeling.  I encouraged them as well as, I was able.  `God, in His mercy, has sent us water, and He may, I trust\\n\\nThough Commander Saltwell made honourable mention of our hero on each, occasion, he received no further recognition of his services.  \\\"I have, no business to complain,\\\" he observed.  \\\"My position is only that of, many others who have done more than I have, but I should like to be, wearing an epaulette on my right shoulder when we get home, and obtain a, command with you, Oliver, as my first lieutenant.\\\"\\n\\nHe saw no harm in what he was doing; on the contrary, he was serving his, friend Bill as well as himself, or rather his mother, for he wanted the, gold for her.  In the meantime, Bill was hurrying on towards the, Turgots' cottage.  He should astonish them, he knew, by waking them up, in the middle of the night, or rather so early in the morning; but they, would appreciate his desire to wish them good-bye, and would be very, much obliged to him for telling them of the treasure in the cavern.\\n\\nThey soon reached the side of the vessel, and climbed up on deck.  There, was plenty of water alongside to launch the raft, and to get the casks, under it.  The wind, too, if there were any, was off shore, but here it, was a perfect calm.  They had one advantage through having waited so, long; they were beyond the influence of the wave which breaks even on a, weather shore, especially after a gale, although the wind may have, changed.\\n\\nThis was Rayner's first action since he had attained his present rank., He endeavoured to maintain his character, and though it was trying work, to see his shipmates struck down on either side of him, he did not for a, moment think of himself or the risk he ran of meeting the same fate., All the time spars, rigging, and blocks were falling from aloft, shot, away by the hot fire of the enemy.  He endeavoured to keep himself cool, and composed, and to execute the orders he received.\\n\\nJack promised to look after Tom, whom he had not seen since the _Lily_, was paid off.  He returned in a few days, saying that he had long, searched for him in vain, until at length he had found him in a low, house in the lowest of the Plymouth slums, his prize-money, to the, amount of nearly a hundred pounds, all gone, and he himself so drunk, that he could not understand the message Jack brought him.\\n\\nBill, as are many other London boys, was exposed to temptations of all, sorts; often when almost starving, without a roof to sleep under, or a, friend to whom he could appeal for help, his shoes worn out, his, clothing too scanty to keep him warm; but, ever recollecting his, mother's last words, he resisted them all.  One day, having wandered, farther east than he had ever been before, he found himself in the, presence of a press-gang, who were carrying off a party of men and boys, to the river's edge.  One of the man-of-war's men seized upon him, and, Bill, thinking that matters could not be much worse with him than they, were at present, willingly accompanied the party, though he had very, little notion where they were going.  Reaching a boat, they were made to, tumble in, some resisting and endeavouring to get away; but a gentle, prick from the point of a cutlass, or a clout on the head, made them, more reasonable, and most of them sat down resigned to their fate.  One, of them, however, a stout fellow, when the boat had got some distance, from the shore, striking out right and left at the men nearest him\\n\\n\\\"I'm much afraid that he will slip through our fingers unless we can, manage to quell the fever.  He requires constant watching, and that is, more than he can well obtain, with so many men laid up, and so much to, do,\\\" said the doctor as he finished his task.  \\\"However, Rayner, if you, can stay by him, I'll be back in a few minutes to see how he's getting, on.  In the meantime give him this medicine; if he comes to his senses\\n\\nThe cable was accordingly ranged ready to let go at a moment's notice;, but Rayner and Oliver well knew that there was little hope of the anchor, holding, or if it did, of the vessel living through the seas which would, break over her as soon as her course was stopped.  Still, desperate as, was the chance, it must be tried.  There might be time to set the, foresail yet, and she might lay to under it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, go and lie down and take a caulk, if the centipedes and, cockroaches will let you,\\\" laughed Rayner.  \\\"They have been crawling all, over me during the time I have been below, but I knew there was no use, attempting to keep them off, so I let them crawl, without interfering, with their pleasure.  If I see any further change in the appearance of, the sky, I will rouse you up, and we'll make the black fellows turn out, to be ready to shorten sail.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope that things are not so bad as that,\\\" responded Bill.  \\\"I will, try and get you below.  Here!\\\" and he called to one of the prisoners who, had remained on deck, and who, being very glad to get out of the way of, the shot, willingly assisted Bill in dragging the wounded man to the, companion-hatchway, down which the two together lifted him, and placed, him in the gun-room.\\n\\nNot many days after this the senior mate of the _Lily_ was taken very, ill while on shore.  His shipmates declared that it was in consequence, of his chagrin at finding that Rayner had obtained his promotion before, him.  They were heartily sorry at having made so unkind a remark, when, in two days news were received on board that the poor fellow had fallen, a victim to yellow fever.\\n\\nThe crews of the other boats had, in the meantime, gained the deck, but, not before the rest of the Frenchmen came tumbling up from below armed, with cutlasses and pikes, or such weapons as they could lay their hands, on.  Though they made a bold stand, and endeavoured to defend the fore, part of the ship, they had to retreat before the desperate charge of the, boarders, who, with cutlasses flashing and cutting, soon hewed a way for, themselves to the forecastle, leaving the deck on either side covered, with dead or wounded men.  Not a word had been spoken, and scarcely a, shout uttered, but the clashing of steel and flashing of pistols must, have showed the people on shore what was going forward.\\n\\nJack, Tom, and Bill felt very much as a person might be supposed to do, who had dropped from the moon.  Everything around them was so strange, and bewildering, for not one of them had ever before been on board a, ship, and Bill had never even seen one.  Having not been much accustomed, to the appearance of trees, he had some idea that the masts grew out of, the deck, that the yards were branches, and the blocks curious leaves;, not that amid the fearful uproar, and what seemed to him the wildest, confusion, he could think of anything clearly.\\n\\n\\\"I would wish to be with him, but I am anxious to relieve the anxiety of, Madame Turgot and Jeannette, who, if they do not see me, will suppose, that I am lost,\\\" answered the Captain.  \\\"I shall grieve to leave my boy, behind, but I know that he will be well cared for, and I cannot tell, you, my young friend, how grateful I am.  Little did I think, when I, picked you up out of the water, how amply you would return the service I, did you.\\\"\\n\\nwhen, as the light slowly increased, at some little distance off he made, out the dim outline of a large ship.  Whether she was a friend or foe he, could not determine; if the latter, the position of the _Lily_ was, critical in the extreme.  He instantly sent the midshipman of the watch, to arouse the commander, who hurried on deck.  After watching the, stranger for a few seconds, they both came to the conclusion that she, was a frigate, and, as they knew of no English vessel of her class, likely to be thereabouts, that she was French.\\n\\nRayner, however, did not feel very confident that they would obey his, orders, but trusted to his powers as a swimmer to make his way back to, the beach.  A sea rolled in.  He swam on bravely, surmounting its, foaming crest.  He had got to the end of the rope, and Ward was still, beyond his reach.  Still he struggled.  Perhaps another sea might bring, the man to him.  He was not disappointed, and grasping the collar of, Ward's jacket, he shouted to Brown and Tom to haul away; but the sea, which had brought Ward in rolled on, and Tom, fancying that he should be, lifted off his legs, let go the rope and sprang back.  Happily, Brown, held on, but his strength was not sufficient to drag in the rope.  In, vain he called on Tom to come back to his assistance.  While tugging, manfully away, he kept his feet on the ground, although the water rose, above his waist.  The next instant the sea bore Rayner and his now, lifeless burden close up to where he stood.  Rayner himself was almost, exhausted, but with the help of Brown, and such aid as Tom was at, length, from very shame, induced to give, they got beyond the influence, of the angry seas Rayner lost no time in trying to restore the seaman\\n\\nRayner was surprised to hear this, supposing that the captain intended, to pull out to sea, whereas he had resolved to go overland to the part, of the coast which probably the ship in distress was approaching., Although where the frigate lay was tolerably smooth water, yet, from the, white-crested seas which broke outside, and the roaring of the wind as, it swept over the land, it was very evident that no boat could live when, once from under its shelter.\\n\\n\\\"You shall have your necessities supplied, and I will gladly do all I, can to protect and help you regain your ship,\\\" she said.  \\\"I was once, with my daughters taken prisoner when on a voyage from France by an, English ship-of-war, and we were treated by the English officers as if, we had been princesses.  Ah! they were indeed true gentlemen!  They won, our hearts;\\\" and she sighed.  \\\"I thought two of them would have become, husbands of my daughters, but stern duty compelled them to sail away, after they had landed us, and we have never heard of them since.\\\"\\n\\nJack was of the same opinion, and he taking up the basket, they groped, their way to the inner cave round the rock, where it turned, as before, described, to the left.  Here they were completely sheltered from the, wind, and had it not been for the loud roar of the waves beating on the, shore, and the howling of the gale in the outer cavern, they would not, have been aware that a storm was raging outside.\\n\\nJack had done his best to support himself without being a burden to his, mother, who sold fish in the neighbouring town and country round, and, could do very well for herself; so when he proposed going on board a, man-of-war, she, having mended his shirts, bought him a new pair of, shoes, and gave him her blessing.  Accordingly, doing up his spare, clothes in a bundle, which he carried at the end of a stick, he trudged, off with a stout heart, resolved to serve His Majesty and fight the, battles of Old England.\\n\\nThe seamen took but little notice of the new hands, though some of them, had been much of the same description themselves, but were not very fond, of acknowledging this, or of talking of their previous histories; they, had, however, got worked into shape by degrees: and the newcomers, even, those with the \\\"long togs,\\\" by the time they had gone through the same, process would not be distinguished from the older hands, except, maybe\\n\\nThe English sailors now had work enough to do to prevent the Frenchmen, from rising.  While sail was being made, numerous boats also were seen, coming off from the shore full of armed men, evidently with the, intention of attempting to board the prize.  Sail after sail was let, drop, and the ship ran faster and faster through the water.  She was, not, however, as yet entirely won.  Her crew, though beaten down below\\n\\nof being discovered, and it would be very ungrateful to the Turgots to, go away without trying to see them again.  He wished that Jack could, have gone also, but he agreed that it was better for him to remain to do, a few more things to the raft.  Before he started they arranged the, tackles for launching it; and they believed that, when once in the, water, it would not take them more than ten minutes or a quarter of an, hour to haul the empty casks under the bottom and to step and set up the, mast.  They might then, should the wind be favourable, stand boldly out, to sea.\\n\\nthe last.  In those days no questions were asked where men or boys came, from.  At the present time, a boy who should thus appear on board a, man-of-war would find himself in the wrong box, and be quickly sent on, shore again, and home to his friends.  None are allowed to enter the, Navy until they have gone through a regular course of instruction in a, training ship, and none are received on board her unless they can read, and write well, and have a formally signed certificate that they have, obtained permission from their parents or guardians.\\n\\n\\\"Another heavy shower fell during the night, and I roused them up to, obtain a further supply of water.  We filled all our hats, for we had, nothing else to put it in.  The next day was but a repetition of the, former.  The water we had obtained during the night was quickly, exhausted.  My hopes of catching some fish appeared likely to be, disappointed.  Twice a shark came near us, but the brute was too large, to give us a chance of catching it.  It was far more likely to have, caught us had we made the attempt.  We shouted to drive it off.  At, last, smaller fish of some sort approached--albicores or bonitas.  It, was extraordinary with what eager looks we eyed the creatures.\\n\\nkeeping time to the tune.  He had two wooden legs in the shape of, mopsticks, and was supporting himself with a crutch, while with the hand, at liberty he held out a battered hat to receive the contributions of, his audience.  Occasionally, when numbers gathered round to listen to, him, he exchanged his song for a yarn.  As Rayner approached he was, saying, \\\"This is the way our government treats our brave seamen.  Here, was I fighting nobly for my king and country, when a Frenchman's shot, spoilt both my legs, and I was left to stump off as best I could on, these here timber toes without a shiner in my pocket, robbed of all my, hard-earned prize-money.  But you good people will, I know, be kind to, poor Jack, and fill this here hat of his with coppers to give him a, crust of bread and a sup to comfort his old heart.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, some soldiers have been there, and impudent fellows they were;, some of them came to our house, and if my Pierre had been present there, would have been a fight.  I am glad that they have gone.  It is said, they were in search of deserters or spies, and that they had caught one, of them, but could not find the rest.  If monsieur dislikes the military, as much as I do, he'll keep out of their way.\\\"\\n\\nThey were in a short time convinced that their proceedings had produced, the desired effect; for when they ceased to make the noise, they heard, the heavy step of a man ascending the creaking stairs.  It had not, occurred to them that he might possibly come with a thick stick in his, hand, to thrash them for making a row.  The idea, however, flashed, across Jack's mind by the time the man was half-way up.\\n\\n\\\"I was very unfortunate to be on board the _Atlante_ when you captured, her, for I had no wish to fight the English,\\\" said Pierre.  \\\"Only ten, days ago I was persuaded to come on board to see a friend, and the crew, would not let me return on shore.  However, I was determined to make the, best of it, hoping before long to get back to my family, and be able to, assist my father.  And now to be cut down by my own countrymen, for it, was a shot from the battery on shore which wounded me.  It is more than, I can bear!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could do nothing else,\\\" was the answer.  \\\"He was about to place, another man in the cradle who had not the courage to get into it by, himself, when a piece of timber surging up struck both of them, the, other was swept away, and the brave English sailor would have suffered, the same fate had I not got hold of him; and then, though I had made up, my mind to remain to the last, I saw that the only way to save him was, to bring him myself in the cradle to the shore, and I am thankful that I, did so.  But my poor countrymen!  There are many still remaining who, must perish if we cannot get another hawser secured to the wreck.\\\"\\n\\nIt would make their fortunes, and Jeannette would be the richest heiress, in the neighbourhood; for, of course, he would bargain that she should, have a good share.  There might be some difficulty in getting the goods, away without being discovered, which would be a pity, as they were of as, much value as the boxes of gold.  However, he was doing what was right, in giving them the opportunity of possessing themselves of the treasure\\n\\n\\\"Come this way, messieurs!\\\" exclaimed Le Duc, at length.  \\\"This must be, the path Francois told me of.\\\"  He had gone a short distance to the, southward, and now led on, feeling the way with his long stick.  The, others followed.  The path was narrow, and the trees met overhead, so, that they were in complete darkness.  On they went, keeping close behind, each other, for there was no room for two to walk abreast.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant now took his leave, and Mrs Crofton observing that, \\\"Pierre would be the better for some sleep, after the excitement of, being moved,\\\" invited Bill into her sitting-room, she naturally wishing, to hear more about his adventures in France than Mr Saltwell had been, able to tell her.  Bill himself was perfectly willing to talk away on, the subject as long as she wished, especially when he found so ready a, listener in Mary.  He began with an account of the blowing up of the, _Foxhound_; and when he had finished, Mrs Crofton wished to know how it, was that he first came to go to sea, and so he had to go back to tell, her all about himself, and the death of his mother, and how he had been, left penniless in the world.\\n\\nTom did not quite like the remarks he heard.  There was going to be a, sharp fight, of that there could be no doubt, and round shot would soon, be coming in through the sides, and taking off men's heads and legs and, arms.  It struck him that he would have been safer at school.  He, thought of his father and mother, and brothers and sisters, who, if he, was killed, would never know what had become of him; not that Tom was a, coward, but it was somewhat trying to the courage even of older hands\\n\\nprobably, be removed, you may then come back without fear, and resume, the clothes you before wore, and live with us, and help my father and, brother; then who knows what may happen?  You will not have to fight, your own countrymen, and the war may some day come to an end, or perhaps, the French may conquer the English, and then we shall all be very good, friends again.\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning the look-out from the mast-head of the _Lily_ announced, a sail on the lee bow.  In a short time, daylight increasing, she was, seen to be a frigate, and no doubt her late antagonist.  Captain, Saltwell at once bore down on her, making a signal to the prize to do so, likewise, and at the same time running up several signals as if speaking, another ship to windward.\\n\\nThe foretopsail had stood, being a new stout sail, and it being closely, reefed, Rayner hoped that the little vessel would lay to under it.  It, was a dangerous experiment he was about to try, but he had to choose, between two evils--that of being driven on shore, or the risk of having, the decks swept by the tremendous seas rolling up from the southward, before the schooner could be hove-to.  She had already run a, considerable distance nearer the land.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" added Mary, in a sweet voice, with a smile, which made our, hero at once promise that he would lose no opportunity of paying them a, visit.  Rayner's first duty was to see Captain Turgot and Pierre on, board the cartel.  They embraced him with tears in their eyes as they, wished him farewell, and many of the grateful Frenchmen gathered round, him, several expressing their hopes that France and England would soon, make up their quarrel.\\n\\nand it is my belief that they were even then going in search of you., Thoughtless of the consequence, I happened to whistle an air which I, sang that night on board the schooner when we were becalmed.  The rogue, of a black recognised it, for, turning my head, I saw him coming after, me.  I was silent directly, and began to walk very fast.  Fortunately it, was almost dusk, and, reaching some thick bushes, I dodged behind them., The black passed me and went on.  I lay quiet, and after a time he came, back, and I heard him tell the soldiers, who had followed him, that he, must have been mistaken; so they then proposed going back to the, village.\\n\\nSoon after noon the wind fell, and the _Lily_ lay motionless on the, glassy ocean; the sun shining forth with intense heat, making the pitch, in the seams of the deck bubble up, and every piece of metal feel as if, it had just come out of a furnace.  The seamen sought every spot of, shade which the sails afforded, and made frequent visits to the, water-cask to quench their thirst.\\n\\n\\\"It's all arranged, messieurs,\\\" he said.  \\\"There's an old lady and two, young ladies in the house.  I told them all about you, when they said, that they were fond of the English, and would be very happy to give you, shelter and food, but that you must come quietly so that no one but, their old brown maitre d'hotel, and black girls who wait on them, should, know that you are in the house.  Follow me, then, and just have the, goodness to tell the men that they must behave themselves or they may be, getting into trouble.\\\"\\n\\nJust then, however, the survivors were too much occupied to think about, the matter; every man and boy was wanted to get the ship to rights, and, all were eagerly looking out for a breeze that they might again attack, the enemy.  Bill was as eager as any one for the fight.  He felt that he, was somebody, as he could not help reflecting that he had done good, service in saving the life of the first lieutenant, though he did not, exactly expect any reward in consequence.  It seemed to him that he had, grown suddenly from a powder monkey into a man.  Still the calm, continued, and the two ships lay with their sails against the masts, the, water shining like a polished mirror.\\n\\nThe first plunge the colonel made with his hand into one of Jack's, pockets brought forth a number of gold pieces.  \\\"Hurroo! now, this is, your innocence is it, young gintlemen?\\\" he exclaimed, exhibiting a, handful of gold to the general.  \\\"Let me be afther seeing what your, other pocket contains;\\\" and as he spoke he quickly drew forth another, handful of gold, some of which, observing that the general and the other, officers were examining the first which he had produced, he slipped into, his own pocket.\\n\\nThus the night passed away.  The breeze slightly increased, but Bill, considered that they might still carry their whole sail with safety., Perhaps they did not move along quite so fast as he supposed.  He told, Jack that he thought they were running through the water at five knots, an hour; but four, or even three, knots was a good deal for a raft to, make, with flat bows, light and well put together as it was.\\n\\nThe wind being very light, every stitch of canvas the _Thisbe_ could, carry was packed on her, and her course altered so as to cut off the, stranger.  As the sun rose, and its beams lighted up the white canvas of, the latter, she was pronounced to be a full-rigged ship, either a, man-of-war or privateer, or a large merchantman, but at the distance she, was off it was difficult to determine whether she was a frigate or a, flush-decked vessel.  Captain Martin hoped that she would prove to be a, frigate, and an antagonist worthy of engaging.  She must have seen the, _Thisbe_ approaching, but either took her for a friend or believed that, she was well able to cope with her, as she did not alter her course., Captain Martin calculated that the _Thisbe_ would be up with the, stranger before noon.  Every telescope on board was directed towards, her.  Bill wished that he had one, that he might form an opinion as to, what she was.  He heard some officers talking, and they declared that, she was undoubtedly French, and was either a large man-of-war corvette\\n\\nhowever, was not easily to be accomplished.  When the officers went to, the window, they found that Jack and his companions had made little, progress.  The bars fitted so closely into the holes that there was but, a small quantity of lead, and without a hammer and chisel it seemed, impossible to make the hole sufficiently large to move the bars so as to, allow Brown to exert his strength upon them.  If the two centre, perpendicular bars could be got out, the lowest horizontal bar might be, sent up.  This would afford ample room for the stoutest of the party to, get through.\\n\\n\\\"When they discovered that you were English, the officers took a fearful, oath that nothing should compel them to yield.  They, however, did their, best to escape; but when they found that you had the heels of them, they, made up their minds to fight, fully expecting, I believe, to take you., Nothing could exceed the savageness of the crew as, stripped to the, waist, they went to their guns.  Several of them, as they cast their, eyes on me, vowed that they would shoot me through the head should the, day go against them.  Having no fancy to be so treated, I thought it, prudent to go below, knowing very well that, in spite of their boasting\\n\\nThey husbanded their food, but it was rapidly diminishing.  At night, they therefore, when the tide had gone out, crept down on the sands, and, managed to cut off some limpets and other shell-fish with their knives, from the rocks.  These would have sustained them for some days had they, been able to cook them, but they had no means of lighting a fire., Though limpets may help to keep body and soul together for a short time\\n\\n\\\"I remember well how you behaved on board the _Foxhound_, and I want you, to keep a watch on the prisoners, and let me know if you hear or see, anything suspicious.  They will probably remain quiet enough, as they, must know that they would have very little chance of success should they, attempt to rise upon us.  At the same time it is better to be on the, safe side, and not to trust them too much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would not be the truth, and we should not be believed,\\\" answered, Bill.  \\\"I would say just what happened--that our ship caught fire and, blew up, that we were saved by the fishermen, that some French soldiers, got hold of us and carried us off prisoners, and that we made our escape, from them.  We need not mention the names of our friends, and perhaps, the interpreter won't be very particular in making inquiries.\\\"\\n\\nordered the _Thisbe's_ helm to be put to port; at the same moment, her, starboard broadside being fired, the shot raked the two Frenchmen fore, and aft.  The helm was then immediately put over, and the frigate coming, up on the other tack, her larboard broadside was poured into her, antagonists.  The shot told with considerable effect.  The foretopmast, of the leading frigate was shot away, and the mizenmast of the one, following was seen to go by the board.  This, however, did not much, alter their rate of sailing, as, the wind being aft, all the canvas they, required continued set.  They also opened their fire, and their shot, came crashing on board the _Thisbe_, killing and wounding two or three, men, but not doing any material damage to her spars or rigging.  She, having shortened sail, her antagonists were compelled to do the same;, and while they poured their broadsides into her, she returned them as, rapidly as the crew could run the guns in and out.\\n\\nThe morning wore on, the hands were piped down to dinner, the prospect, of hot work not at all damping their appetites, though perhaps they got, through their meal rather faster than was their wont; when they again, hurried on deck to see how things were going on.  The two French, frigates were approaching.  The headmost in a short time fired a, bowchaser, but the shot fell short.  It served, however, as a signal to, prepare for action.  Once more the guns were cast loose, and their crews, stood ready to fire as soon as they received the looked-for word of, command.\\n\\nAt last Bill and Jeannette persuaded them that there really was such a, cave; but on considering the hour, they came to the conclusion that the, tide would come in before they could make their escape from it, and they, would prefer going when the tide had again made out.  Bill, they, thought, would only just have time to get on board the vessel, if he was, determined to go.\\n\\n\\\"She hasn't come up with us yet,\\\" answered Bill.  \\\"We shall have time to, beat off the others and stand away to the northward before she gets us, within range of her guns.  Perhaps, too, the wind will shift to the, eastward, and throw her to leeward.  We shall then be well in with, Plymouth by the time she can manage to beat up to us.  We are not going, to give in while the tight little frigate keeps above water.\\\"\\n\\nThe wind, which had been moderate when the action began, had now greatly, increased.  Not a moment was lost in commencing the repair of damages., The sky indicated the approach of bad weather, and a westerly or, south-westerly gale might be expected.  Before all the shot-holes could, be stopped it came on to blow very hard.  Plymouth being too far to the, westward, the nearest shelter the _Thisbe_ could reach was Portland\\n\\nAnother attempt was made.  The main-trysail was shifted to the foremast;, if that would stand, the vessel might possibly be kept off shore; but, scarcely had it been set, than the hurricane came down on the hapless, vessel with redoubled fury.  The weather rigging gave way, and down came, the mast itself, killing one of the blacks, and fearfully crushing, another; and, to Rayner's dismay striking down Jack Peek.  He sprang, forward to drag Jack out from beneath the tangled rigging and spars\\n\\n\\\"Mais, ma foi! those poltroons who ran off, afraid that the sea would, swallow them up, should be ashamed of themselves,\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"You, had best show your gratitude, my friend, by getting them to assist us in, bringing off my brother officer and the seaman from the wreck,\\\" answered, Rayner.  \\\"I fear that she will not hold together many hours, and unless, they are soon rescued they may lose their lives.\\\"\\n\\nOliver and Jack, who were at the helm, as they put it down prepared to, lash it to starboard; but as the vessel came up to the wind, a fearful, sea struck her, sweeping over her deck, carrying away the caboose and, the whole of the bulwarks forward; at the same moment the foretopsail, split as the other had done, and the canvas, after fluttering wildly in, the blast, was whisked round and round the yard.\\n\\n\\\"What it's all about, ma foi, is more than I or any of us can tell,\\\", exclaimed a boatswain's mate, wringing Rayner's hand, which all were, eager to grasp.  \\\"We are carried on board ship and told to fight, and so, we fight--more fools we!  If we were wise, we should navigate our, merchant vessels, or go fishing, or stay at home and cultivate our, fields and gardens.  We all hope that there'll be peace when we next, meet, messieurs.\\\"\\n\\nThe western shore was reached at last.  As they approached the cliffs, they saw a number of people moving about, and as they got to the bay and, looked down over the foaming ocean, they could see a dark object some, fifty fathoms off, from which proceeded piercing shrieks and cries for, help.  It was the hull of a large ship, hove on her beam-ends, her masts, gone, the after-part already shattered and rent by the fierce seas which, dashed furiously against her, threatening to sweep off the miserable, wretches clinging to the bulwarks and stanchions.  To form a, communication with her was Captain Martin's first object.  As yet it was, evident that no attempt of the sort had been made, most of the people, who had collected being more eager apparently to secure the casks\\n\\n\\\"Dear Tom,--Our father received yours of the third instant, as the first, intimation of your being alive since your unaccountable disappearance., You have caused us by your wicked proceeding no end of grief and, trouble, and, as far as we can make out by your wretchedly written, epistle, you do not seem to be at all ashamed of yourself, or sorry for, what you have done; and our father bids me to say, that as you have made, your bed, you must lie in it.  As to making you an allowance of thirty, or forty pounds a year, and getting you placed on the quarter-deck, the, notion is too ridiculous to be entertained.  I must tell you, too, our, father has failed, smashed up completely, won't pay sixpence in the, pound.  As we find it a hard matter to live, he is not likely to make, you an allowance of thirty pounds, or thirty pence a year, or to trouble, himself by going to the Admiralty with the certainty of being sent away, with a flea in his ear; so you see, Tom, you must just grin and bear it., If you don't get killed, I would advise you--should you ever wish to, come home--to make your appearance with your pockets full of the, prize-money you talk of, and you will then perhaps receive a welcome\\n\\ndetermined to let them escape.  He had already three hundred and forty, prisoners on board, while his own crew amounted to only one hundred and, ninety.  Should he take another prize, he would have still further to, diminish the number of the ship's company, while that of the prisoners, would be greatly increased.  The French and American captains had come, on deck, and were standing apart, watching the distant vessels.\\n\\n\\\"We must try to pick up some shell-fish from the rocks,\\\" answered Bill., \\\"The soldiers by that time will have got tired of looking for us, and if, any persons from the top of the cliffs see us they won't know who we, are, and will fancy we are fisher-boys getting bait.  Perhaps before, that time a smuggling lugger may come off here, and we may manage to, hail her before we run short of food; at all events, there's no use, being frightened about what may happen.\\\"\\n\\nIn this book three boys join up in the same batch.  They have the usual, Kingston-style adventures, but only one of them makes it to the quarter, deck to become a midshipman.  This was probably the hardest step for any, of them, but it was his bravery, honesty and good manners that won for, him the necessary attention.  At the end of the book there is a pathetic, scene where we meet again the boy who did least well.  This is a good, and enjoyable read or listen, taking about twelve and three quarter, hours.\\n\\ncaptured by an English man-of-war; that she had been driven by the, hurricane on the reef, and that it was their belief the English officers, and crew had escaped as well as themselves, but they could not tell what, had become of them.  The mayor, on hearing this, had despatched a party, of gendarmes in search of the missing people.  How soon they may be here, it is impossible to say.\\\"\\n\\nThe master, some time before, had brought up a chart on deck, and now, pointed out to his brother officers the exact spot towards which the, ship was steering.  It was the Bay of Rosas.  Already the ship was, entering between two capes which formed its northern and southern sides., The captain stood in the midst of his officers and men, gathered on, deck, for every place below was filled with smoke, and, except in the, after-part of the ship, the raging flames had gained full mastery.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, Pierre entered the house.  His joy at seeing, his father almost overcame him.  They threw themselves into each other's, arms and embraced as Frenchmen are accustomed to embrace--somewhat, it, must be confessed, to Mary's amusement.  After they had become more, tranquil they sat down and talked away at such a rate that even Rayner, could scarcely understand what they were saying.  He meantime had a, pleasant conversation with Mary and her mother, for he had plenty to, tell them, and they evidently liked to listen to him.\\n\\nThe greatest efforts were now made to set up the jury-masts.  The wind, was increasing, and the sea rising every minute.  The day also was, drawing on, and matters were getting worse and worse; still Captain, Waring and his staunch crew worked away undaunted.  If they could once, get up the jury-masts, a course might be steered either for the Isle of, Wight or Plymouth.  Sails had been got up from below; the masts were, ready to raise, when there came a cry of, \\\"The enemy is standing towards, us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw soon afterwards two others floating at some distance from the, raft.  One of them shouted for help saying that he was exhausted, and, could no longer support himself.  The other, notwithstanding left him to, his fate and swam towards us.  I could not bear to see the poor fellow, perish in our sight with the possibility of saving him, and as there was, no time to be lost, I plunged in and made for him, picking up in my way, a piece of plank.  I placed it under his arms, and telling him to hold, on to it, shoved it before me in the direction of the raft.  The other, fellow had in the meantime got hold of a piece of timber, on which he, was resting, but was apparently almost exhausted.  As I passed, I told, him that if I could I would come to his help, and I at length managed to, get back to the raft, on to which the three other men had hauled up, their other shipmate.\\n\\nTheir plan was to form an oblong square, then to put on bows at one end;, and two pieces crossing each other with a short upright between them, on, which to support the steering oar.  The interior of the framework they, strengthened by two diagonal braces.  They lashed and nailed a number of, crosspieces close together, and on the top of the whole they nailed down, all the planks they could find, which were sufficient to form a good, flooring to their raft.\\n\\nOnce more the boys got their oars out, and laboured away as, energetically as before.  They every now and then, however, looked back, to ascertain if the boat were coming after them.  Meantime a light, breeze played occasionally over the water, but it was so light that it, would not have helped them much, and they thought it wiser not to hoist, their sail, as it would betray their position should a French boat, really be in pursuit of them.\\n\\nThe lieutenant of marines quickly turned out his men, while the, boatswain roused up the most trustworthy of the seamen.  So quickly and, silently all was done, that a strong body of officers and men well armed, were collected on the quarter-deck before any of the prisoners were, aware of what was going forward.  They were awaiting the captain's, orders, when a loud report was heard.  A thick volume of smoke ascended, from below, and the next instant, with loud cries and shouts, a number, of the prisoners were seen springing up the hatchway ladders.\\n\\n\\\"Hurrah! thanks to that shot, we may make our escape out of this, for, the Frenchmen are too much engaged at the guns to see us!\\\" cried Jack., \\\"Let us get down to the shore, and when we are once there we may manage, to find our way aboard the ship.  The chances are we shall find some, fishing boat or other on the beach.  May we try, sir, what we can do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know our men, and can answer for their doing their duty,\\\" replied Mr, Saltwell, with confidence.  \\\"If we delay getting out the boats, we may, find it impossible to do so at last, and the lives of all on board may, be sacrificed.  We can trust to the marines, and give them directions to, prevent any of the men getting into the boats until you issue the order, for them to do so.\\\"\\n\\nThe commanders of the two ships were received by the captain in his, cabin, while the gun-room officers invited those of similar rank to mess, with them, the men taking care of the French and American crews.  The, British seamen treated them rather as guests than prisoners, being ready, to attend to their wants and to do them any service in their power., Their manner towards the Frenchmen showed the compassion they felt\\n\\nSummoning the gunner and the boatswain, the first lieutenant ordered the, former to open the ports, to give light and air below, and the latter to, pipe up the hammocks.  He then ascended to the orlop deck, made his way, first into one tier, then into another, in both of which he found the, smoke issuing exceedingly thick from forward.  He was now joined by the, second lieutenant and Rayner.\\n\\n\\\"I sat up, hoping against hope that you might come back to ascertain if, any people had escaped, or that some other vessel might pass within, hail.  We had no means of making a signal, not even a spar on which to, hoist our handkerchiefs or shirts.  The only article which had by some, means or other been thrown on the raft was a blanket.  How it had fallen, there I cannot tell.  I secured it, and doubling it up, it served as a, rest to my head.  I constantly, however, got up to look about, but no, vessel could I see, and at length, overpowered by weariness, I lay down, and fell asleep.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want to see your wives and families again?\\\" he asked.  \\\"Look, there!  How smooth the water is ahead.  The wind is falling, and the, frigate will soon be becalmed.  She'll not think it worth while to send, her boats after us.  Come! out with the sweeps, and we shall soon draw, out of shot of her.  Look there! now her topsails are already flapping, against the masts.  Be of good courage, my sons!\\\"\\n\\nHe grasped it with both his hands, and eagerly drank the contents.  A, second mug had in the meantime been filled.  One of the Frenchmen, in, his eagerness to reach it, stretched out his arms, and fell flat on his, face.  The English seamen lifted him up, and gently poured the water, down his throat.  He and two more were lifted on board.  They then took, a cup to the rest, who were too weak to make the slightest exertion., They poured some water down the throat of one; he gave one gasp, and, then sank back, apparently lifeless.  A sixth person was already beyond, human help.  On raising his arm, it fell again at his side.\\n\\nwith others who had hurried from below, fully believed that the enemy, had hauled down her flag, but instead of that, under all the sail she, could carry, she continued standing away until she had got two miles, off.  Here she hove-to, in order, it was evident, to repair damages., These must have been very severe, for many of her men were seen over the, sides engaged in stopping shot-holes, while the water, which issued, forth in cascades, showed that the pumps were being worked with might, and main to keep her from sinking.\\n\\nBill's mother was buried in a rough shell by the parish, and Bill went, out into the world to seek his fortune.  He took to curious ways,--, hunting in dust-heaps for anything worth having; running errands when he, could get any one to send him; holding horses for gentlemen, but that, was not often; doing duty as a link-boy at houses when grand parties, were going forward or during foggy weather; for Bill, though he often, went supperless to his nest, either under a market-cart, or in a cask by, the river side, or in some other out-of-the-way place, generally managed, to have a little capital with which to buy a link; but the said capital, did not grow much, for bad times coming swallowed it all up.\\n\\n\\\"There's no chance of your getting back for the present, but I hope you, will see your mother and sister notwithstanding,\\\" answered Bill.  \\\"We, are running across the Channel, and shall be in an English port in a day, or two, when you will be landed, and I will ask the captain to let me, take care of you.  I should like to prove how grateful I am for all your, kindness to me and Jack Peek, and I will tell Mr Saltwell, the, lieutenant who commands this ship, how you and your family treated me., But I don't think you ought to talk; I came to see if I could do, anything for you.\\\"\\n\\nBill drew his head in from the window, and beckoned to Jack, who, followed him up; and as there was no time to be lost, he at once dropped, down on to the top of the wall.  Jack came next, fortunately without, dislodging any stones, which might have rattled down and betrayed their, proceedings.  Bill leading, they made their way on hands and knees along, the top of the wall, which, being fringed in most places with bushes\\n\\nAll the canvas they could carry was set.  In a short time one of the, strangers was seen to haul up to the northward, and the _Lily_ was, ordered to go in pursuit of her.  She was apparently the smallest of the, three, but was still likely to prove no mean antagonist.  As the _Lily_, appeared to be gaining on her, the commander gave the order to prepare, for action.  The frigate meantime was standing after the other two, vessels.  Before long her topsails, and finally her royals, disappeared, beneath the horizon.\\n\\nHe climbed up to it, and gazed out.  Great was his satisfaction to, perceive the top of a massive wall a few feet below him.  The tower had, been a portion of an old castle, and the end of this wall was a mass of, ruins, but quite thick enough to enable them to scramble along the top, of it, and Bill had no doubt that they thence could easily descend to\\n\\n\\\"I've no very clear notion about the matter,\\\" he answered; \\\"I must have, been in the water, for I found myself lying at the bottom of a boat wet, to the skin, and more dead than alive.  There were a dozen or more of, our fellows in her, and Mr Saltwell, our first lieutenant, who had been, picked up, I supposed, as I had been.  They thought I was done for, and\\n\\nThere were two small chests placed on the top of the others.  They were, strongly secured; but by means of a sharp stone, which served as a, chisel, and another as a hammer, they managed to break one of them open., What was their surprise to find the case full of gold pieces!  They had, little doubt that the other also contained money.  They, neither of, them, had ever seen so much gold before.\\n\\nThe country, from the glimpse they had had of it, appeared more inviting, to the west, but Rayner reflected that by going in that direction they, would get farther and farther from the Spanish territory, but were they, once to reach it, they might claim assistance from the inhabitants.  How, many miles they were from the border neither Rayner nor Oliver was, certain; it might be a dozen or it might be twenty or thirty.  Le Duc, could give them no information.  It was difficult to find the way in the, darkness; they could indeed only guide themselves by listening to the, roar of the breakers, with an occasional glimpse of the dark ocean to, the right.  The two officers agreed that it would be of great advantage, to get into Spanish territory before daylight, as they would thus avoid, being taken prisoners.  Though their object in coming on the coast was a, peaceable one, it would be difficult to induce the authorities to, believe that this was the case.  Le Duc promised that he would bear, testimony to the truth of the account they intended to give of, themselves; but, he observed, \\\"My word may not be believed, and I myself, may be accused of being a deserter.  The people hereabouts do not set, much value on human life, and they may shoot us all to save themselves, the trouble of making further inquiries.\\\"\\n\\nNews of the battered state of the _Thisbe_ having been received at the, Admiralty, a frigate was ordered round to escort her into port, as she, was not in a position to put to sea safely by herself.  The Frenchmen, having been received on board the two frigates, and a light northerly, breeze springing up, they sailed together for Plymouth.  The pumps were, kept going on board the _Thisbe_ during the whole passage, when the, Frenchmen, at the instigation of Captain Turgot, volunteered to work, them.\\n\\n\\\"My lads!\\\" he said, \\\"some of you have fought under me before now, and, though the odds were against us, we licked the enemy.  We have got, somewhat greater odds, perhaps, at present, but I want to take two or, three of those ships; they are not quite as powerful as they look, and, if you will work your guns as I know you can work them, we'll do it, before many hours have passed.  We have a fine breeze to help us, and, will tackle one after the other.  You'll support me, I know.\\\"\\n\\nThe Frenchmen, however, fought bravely, and evidently did not intend to, let him get off if they could help it.  Each had just fired another, broadside into the _Thisbe_, when they were seen to haul their wind, the, two ships coming up astern doing the same.  The reason of this was, evident: the line-of-battle ship to the westward, now approaching under, a pressure of sail, had hoisted British colours, and any longer delay, would have enabled her quickly to capture one or both of them.  The, brave crew of the _Thisbe_ expressed their satisfaction by giving a loud, cheer, which was joined in even by many of the wounded.\\n\\nThe rope held, however, though, as he felt it, it appeared stretched to, the utmost.  He could with difficulty draw a breath, while he waited, till, by finding the rope slacken, he should know that Bill had safely, reached the bottom.  At last he ascertained that Bill was no longer, hanging to the rope, while, from not hearing a sound, he was sure that, his companion had performed the feat in safety.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" she answered.  \\\"I was delayed, or I should have set off, earlier, but a party of soldiers came to the village pretending that, they wanted to buy fish.  I, however, suspected that they came to look, for you, and I waited till they had gone away again.  We sold them all, the fish they asked for, and put on an unconcerned look, as if, suspecting nothing, I saw them, however, prying about, and I recognised, one of them as the sergeant who came in command of the party which, carried you off.  I am not at all certain, either, that they will not, return, and I should not have ventured out, had I not known that you, must be greatly in want of food, and that, perhaps, should the storm, which is now beginning increase, many days might pass before I could, supply you.\\\"\\n\\nIt of course occurred to Rayner that if Oliver could manage to float a, cask, or even a piece of plank secured to the end of a rope, a, communication might be established between the wreck and the shore; but, as far as he could see, the running rigging and all the ropes had gone, overboard with the masts, and the only coil saved was that which had, been brought in the boat.\\n\\nIn another second or two the other forts followed suit.  The whole, atmosphere was filled with a dense black cloud and masses of lurid flame, beneath, while thundering reports in rapid succession rent the air.  A, few seconds afterwards down came showers of stone and earth and pieces, of burning timber, just astern of the boats.  Had there been any delay, they must have been overwhelmed.  Fortunately they all escaped injury\\n\\nWe might give not a few instances of more recent date, but the families, and friends of those \\\"who have risen\\\" do not always feel the same honest, pride as the great men themselves in the story of their life.  While it, is true that no sailor boy may now hope to become \\\"Admiral of the, Fleet,\\\" yet there is room for advancement, in peace as in war, to what, is better than mere rank or title or wealth,--a position of honour and, usefulness.  Good character and good conduct, pluck and patience\\n\\n\\\"We should have to get food first, even if we did run off with a boat,\\\", observed Bill.  \\\"It would never do to put to sea without something to, eat.  I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll try and make my way back to, Captain Turgot's.  It cannot be far from this.  I'll ask them to give us, some food.  They are sure to do that, though they might not like hiding, us; and perhaps they might tell us of some boat in which we could get, off without the owner being the worse for the loss.  If you'll stay, here, I'll go this very evening as soon as the tide is out.  I calculate, that I should have time to get there and back before the flood is up;, and I'm not afraid of being refused, at all events.\\\"  Jack wanted to go, too; but Bill urged that one was less likely to be discovered than two\\n\\nchests, and other things thrown on shore than to assist their perishing, fellow-creatures.  It was vain to shout and direct the people on the, wreck to attach a line to a cask and let it float in towards the beach., The most stentorian voices could not make themselves heard when sent in, the teeth of the gale now blowing.  On descending the cliffs, Captain, Martin and his party found a narrow strip of beach, on which they could, stand out of the power of the seas, which, in quick succession, came, foaming and roaring in towards them.  He immediately ordered a couple of, rockets to be let off, to show the strangers that there were those on, shore who were ready to help them.  No signal was fired in return, not, even a lantern shown, but the crashing, rending sounds which came from, the wreck made it too evident that she could not much longer withstand, the furious assaults of the raging ocean.  Captain Martin inquired, whether any of his crew were sufficiently good swimmers to reach the, wreck.\\n\\nwith straining eyes, they gazed at the land.  On either side a dark mass, of smoke ascended before them, and blew away to leeward, while the lurid, flames rose beneath it, striving furiously for victory over the masts, and spars, sails and rigging.  It seemed like a miracle that the masts, should stand in the midst of the hot furnace which glowed far down the, depths of the ship.  All were aware that at any moment one of several, fearful events might occur.  The wind might shift and prevent the ship, reaching the land ahead, or a gale might spring up and cast the ship, helplessly upon the rocks, or a calm might come on and delay her, progress, or the masts, burnt through, might fall and crush those on, deck, or, still more dreadful, a spark might reach the magazine, and her, immediate destruction must follow.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, what language is that?\\\" exclaimed the sergeant, holding up his, lantern and examining the sailor's countenance.  \\\"You are not a, Frenchman, I'll vow.\\\"  He turned from one to the other, looking in the, faces of each.  \\\"Why, I believe these are the very men we were ordered, to search for.  Seize them all.  Take care that none escape.  There are, five of them, the very number we were told of, and one, the traitor, we, have already got.  Can any of you speak French? though I doubt it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They'll have a tough job, sir, let me tell them,\\\" observed Bill.  \\\"I, haven't seen much of English sojers except the Guards in London, and our, Marines on board ship, but I know that one of our Guardsmen would lick a, whole tentful of the little chaps I see about here; and I would advise, the general to stay quietly at home, and not attempt to take our tight, little island.\\\"\\n\\nThe midshipmen had finished theirs, and Rayner, who had just relieved, one of his messmates on deck, was on the look-out when he espied, away, on the larboard bow, a sail through the fog, which had somewhat, dispersed in that quarter.  A second glance convinced him that she was a, large ship.  He instantly shouted out the welcome intelligence.  Every, one hoped that she was the vessel they were in search of.  The drum beat, to quarters, and scarcely were the guns run out than the fog clearing, still more discovered a large frigate standing under all sail to the, eastward, about half a mile away.  If she were the one they had before, seen, she had evidently acted as Captain Martin had supposed might be, the case, and having crossed the _Thisbe's_ course, had then kept away\\n\\n\\\"We ought to be thankful that we are in so snug a place,\\\" observed Bill;, \\\"but I tell you, we must take care not to eat up all our food in a, hurry, or we may find it a hard matter to get more.  The wind appears to, have driven the sea over on this shore, and I doubt whether we shall be, able to make our way along the beach even at low water.\\\"\\n\\nRayner, observing that the surf did not roll up the beach to any, considerable height, looked out for a passage through which the vessel, might be steered.  The continuous line of breakers ran as far as the eye, could reach along the shore.  There was only one spot where they seemed, to break with less fury.  Towards it Rayner determined to steer the, schooner.  He and Oliver soon came to the conclusion that it would be, useless to attempt anchoring.  The water, probably, was far too deep, outside the reef for their range of cable, and even if it were not, the, anchor was not likely to hold.\\n\\n\\\"Well! if it is a ghost it won't hurt us,\\\" answered Bill; \\\"but the only, ghosts hereabouts are those curious figures, which can't move from their, places.  For my part, I don't believe there are such things as ghosts at, all going about to frighten people.  The only one I ever heard tell of, was `The Cock Lane Ghost', and that was found out to be a sham long, ago.\\\"\\n\\nJack and Bill made themselves very useful in hauling the nets, and, cleaning the fish when caught.  Jack was well up to the work, and showed, Bill how to do it.  Captain Turgot was highly pleased, and called them, \\\"bons garcons,\\\" and said he hoped that they would remain with him till, the war was over, and as much longer as they liked.  When the cutter, returned into the harbour to land her fish, Jack and Bill were sent, below, so that the authorities might not see them and carry them off., Captain Turgot was much afraid of losing them.  They were getting on, famously with their French, and Bill could chatter away already at a, great rate, though not in very good French, to be sure, for he made a, number of blunders, which afforded constant amusement to his companions\\n\\nIt was Oliver's duty to go on board and take possession of the prize., Unwillingly he left his friend's side.  Of the _Lily's_ crew five had, been killed, and many more beside her commander, wounded.  But Oliver, saw, as he stepped on board the prize, how much more severely she had, suffered.  Everywhere lay dead and dying men.  How dread and terrible a, fact is war!  A lieutenant, coming forward, presented his sword.\\n\\nBill felt a strong inclination to follow the advice given him.  One of, the men, bundling up his wet clothes, carried them to dry at the little, galley fire forward.  The rest went on deck, and Bill in another minute, fell fast asleep.  Where the cutter was going Bill could not tell.  He, had known her to be a fishing-vessel by seeing the nets on deck, and he, had guessed that she was French by the way in which the people on board, had spoken.  They had given evidence also that they intended to treat, him kindly.\\n\\nHe went up on deck, hoping that the man who had spoken a few words of, English might be able to tell him how Jack had been picked up.  On, reaching the deck he found that the vessel was close in with the land., She was towing a shattered gig, which Bill recognised as one of those, belonging to the _Foxhound_.  He at once conjectured that Jack had, managed somehow or other to get into her.\\n\\nThis done, they jumped into their respective beds, and when once there, they agreed that, if they were not so hungry, they would infinitely, prefer going to sleep to having to get up again and make themselves, agreeable to the ladies.  As soon as Francois got possession of their, clothes he hurried away, but shortly returned, bringing with him a, supply of linen and silk stockings, and two antiquated court suits., They were, he said, the only costumes which he considered worthy of the, English officers, and he begged that they would put them on without, ceremony.\\n\\nThe sun was by this time sinking towards the west; and should darkness, come on, their chances of escape would be increased.  The wind had, shifted slightly to the south-west, and should it freshen sufficiently, to make it worth while hoisting the sail, they might stand away to the, north-east.  It still, however, wanted two or three hours before it, would be perfectly dark, while the boat would be up to them before that, time.  After rowing for the greater part of an hour, Jack again took a, look-out, and reported that he could distinctly see the boat.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I was right,\\\" said Jack, coming down.  \\\"I made out a boat, as sure, as we are here, and a large one, too, or I should not have seen her so, clearly.  She's a good way off still, so that it will be some time, before she can get up with us.  The French fellows in her must take, yonder ship to be a countryman, or they would not pull on so boldly.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, having closed the door, they got up seven of the steps, beginning, at the uppermost one, till they formed a gap which it would be, impossible for a man to spring over.  The boards they carried down as, they descended, when they found themselves in another storey, the whole, of which was occupied by one large room without doors, the reason, of, course, why it had not been made their prison.\\n\\nThe two ships, with the flags of the commanders on each side, were now, engaged at close quarters, yard-arm and yard-arm, and completely, enveloped in smoke.  This proved favourable to the purpose of the brave, youth, who mounted the shrouds through the smoke unobserved, gained the, French Admiral's main-yard, ascended with agility to the main-topgallant, mast-head, and carried off the French flag.  It was soon seen that the, enemy's colours had disappeared, and the British sailors, thinking they, had been hauled down, raised a shout of \\\"Victory, victory!\\\"  The French, were thrown into confusion by this, and first slackened fire, and then, ran from their guns.  At this juncture the ship was boarded by the, English and taken.  Hopson had by this time descended the shrouds with, the French flag wrapped round his arm, which he triumphantly displayed.\\n\\nCaptain Martin, on seeing this, sent Rayner below with orders to double, shot the after-maindeck guns, and to fire them as the enemy came close, up.  The next he shouted the cry which British seamen are always ready, to obey, \\\"Boarders, repel boarders;\\\" and every man not engaged at the, guns hurried aft, cutlass in hand, ready to drive back the foe as soon, as the ships should touch; but ere that moment arrived, an iron shower, issued from the guns beneath their feet, crashing through the, Frenchman's bows and tearing along her decks.  Instead of coming on, she, suddenly threw all her sails aback, and hauled off out of gunshot.  On, seeing this, the British crew uttered three hearty cheers, and Rayner\\n\\nJack regained his courage as they approached the fire, and both being, pretty well tired, they were glad to sit down and talk about the, wonderful store of goods they had discovered.  Jack was afraid that the, owners might come back to look for their property and discover them, but, Bill was of opinion that they had been placed there by a party of, smugglers, who had gone away and been lost without telling any one where, they had stowed their goods.\\n\\nThe moment for action was approaching.  The ship was seen at the spot, where Bill thought she would be found, lying silent and dark, her tall, masts and the tracery of her rigging just to be distinguished against, the sky.  No one was observed moving on her deck.  Eagerly the boats, dashed forward to the posts allotted to them.  The bows of the barge had, just hooked on when the sentry on the gangway, who had evidently not, been attending to his duty, shouted out, and fired his musket.\\n\\n\\\"I have been thinking too much about going away to feel hungry,\\\" said, Bill.  \\\"But now you talk of it, I should like some food, and I hope, they'll bring enough to last us for a day or two.  Now, I say, it's, getting dark, and we must fix upon the best spot to lower ourselves down, to.  You listen at the door lest any one should come up suddenly, and, I'll examine the windows and settle the best plan.\\\"\\n\\nAs Oliver, who went first, had just got to the top, his attention was, attracted by loud shouts coming from the rear of the fort.  Above them, quickly rose a hearty British cheer.  Showers of bullets came flying, through the air.  The shouts and cries increased.  Amid the clash of, steel, and the sharp crack of pistols, the voices of the officers, reached him calling the men to abandon the guns and defend the fort., But it was too late.  Already a strong party of blue-jackets and marines, were inside.\\n\\n\\\"Well, lads,\\\" said Green, who was a bit of a wag in his way, as he, looked at the powder-boys still seated on their tubs, \\\"as you have still, got your heads on your shoulders, you may put some food into your, mouths.  Maybe you won't have another opportunity after we get up with, the big 'un we are chasing.  I told you, mates,\\\" he added, turning to, the crew of his gun, \\\"the captain knew what he was about, and would make, the Frenchmen haul down their flags before we hauled down ours.  I, should not be surprised if we got the whole lot of them.\\\"\\n\\nHe was now able, in spite of the wind, to get along where he had before, found it difficult to pass.  In one or two places only did the waves, rolling up wash round his feet, but the water was not of sufficient, depth to carry him off, and he gained the mouth of the cavern in safety., Jack was eagerly looking out for him, and both of them being very sharp, set, they lost no time in discussing some of the contents of the basket.\\n\\n\\\"I have been making inquiries as to what can be done for your friend, Pierre Turgot,\\\" he said.  \\\"As you told me he was not willingly on board, the privateer, I was able to state that in his favour, and I have, obtained leave for him to be removed to a private house, where he can, remain until he has recovered, and he will then, I hope, be allowed to, return to France without waiting for an exchange of prisoners.  Were he, to be sent back with others, he would probably at once be compelled to, serve afloat, and his great desire is, I understand, to return to his, own family, to follow his former occupation of a fisherman.\\\"\\n\\nTom, and the whole of the men who had been on the ladders, sneaked away, on either side, ashamed, at all events, of being found out, and still, looking with longing eyes at the boats astern.  Every now and then a, seaman was brought aft and placed under the doctor's care, but of the, number four were found to be past recovery, and it seemed doubtful, whether several others would revive.\\n\\nJack and Bill could scarcely refrain from laughing as the old woman ran, on, but they restrained themselves, and when she showed them the, contents of the basket, they merely said, \\\"Bon! bon! merci! merci!\\\", several times, and looked very well pleased, as indeed they were, for, there was food enough to last them two or three days, full allowance--, cheese and sausages, bread, figs, raisins, and butter, besides the, bottle of wine.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what, messieurs, without food we shall make slow progress., I'll go into the village and try to procure some.  I shall easily learn, from some person, before I venture to enter, whether the gendarmes are, there, and if they are not, we shall be safe for the present.  They, will, I hope, fancying that you made your way back to the house of, Madame La Roche, have gone off there.  We must hope for the best, and I, will try and invent some reason for wishing to purchase food.  The kind, lady supplied me with money, so that I shall have no difficulty on that, score.\\\"\\n\\nAs Rayner, who had charge of the foremost guns, was watching her, he, caught sight of a young man in the uniform of a midshipman, who sprang, suddenly up through the companion-hatch, and, making his way aft, seemed, to be addressing the captain with energetic action.  Rayner got but a, glimpse of him, for the next moment there came a fearful roaring sound., The deck of the enemy's ship rose in the air, rent into a thousand, fragments.  Her masts and yards and sails shot upwards, and her dark, hull seemed suddenly to melt away.\\n\\n\\\"At first I had hopes that you would discover us and put back to take us, off; but when I perceived that you were on fire, I began to fear that we, should not be observed, though I did not say so to my companions in, misfortune, but endeavoured to keep up their spirits.  I told them that, if the ship with which they had been engaged should come back, my, countrymen would not look upon them as enemies, but would treat them, kindly, as people who had suffered a great misfortune.  When, however\\n\\nThe _Bombay Castle_ was rolling her away across the Bay of Biscay with a, northerly breeze.  She was a very different craft from the _Thisbe_, and, though more than twice her size, not nearly so comfortable.  Captain, Martin had received orders to avoid an engagement, except attacked, and, then to do his best to escape, as the stores she carried were of great, value, and were much required by the fleet.  Though several sail were, sighted supposed to be an enemy's squadron, she managed to escape from, them, and arrived safe at Gibraltar.  Here she was joined by the _Ione_, frigate, and the two ships sailed together, expecting to fall in with, the fleet off Toulon.\\n\\nAmong those who observed him was Bill Rayner.  Bill's wits were always, sharp, and they had been still more sharpened since he came to sea by, the new life he was leading.  He had his eyes always about him to take, in what he saw, and his ears open whenever there was anything worth, hearing.  It had struck him as a strange thing that so many prisoners, should submit quietly to be kept in subjection by a mere handful of, Englishmen.  On seeing the American skipper talking to his men, he crept, in unobserved among them.  His ears being wide open, he overheard, several words which dropped from their lips.\\n\\nnarrow windows close under the roof, they were left in almost perfect, obscurity, so that they could not venture to move from the spot where, they stood.  As, however, their eyes got accustomed to the gloom, they, found that they were in a room about twelve or fourteen feet square, the, floor and sides being of roughly hewn stone.  Round it ran a stone, bench, just above which they could see several massive iron rings fixed, in the walls.\\n\\nHe could not help thinking, as he hurried back towards the cave, that, she suspected he was one of the persons the soldiers were in search of., Although she wished to befriend him, her father might be in a different, mood.  There was the danger, too, that if poor Le Duc was caught, he, might be tortured to make him confess where his companions were.  Rayner, considered, therefore, that it would be imprudent to remain longer in, the cave, and that it would be safer even to carry Jack, should he be, unable to walk, than to delay their journey.\\n\\nRayner very gladly accepted the invitation.  Neither Oliver nor Mrs, Crofton had thought about the result, but before many weeks were over, Commander William Rayner was engaged to marry Mary Crofton, who had, given him as loving and gentle a heart as ever beat in woman's bosom., He told her how often he had talked about her when away at sea, and how, often he had thought of her, although he had scarcely dared to hope that, she would marry one who had been a London street boy and powder monkey.\\n\\nNo time was lost in procuring what was necessary, when Oliver returned, to the _Mouche_, for such was the name of the prize.  The corvette, making sail, she and the schooner ran on in company until they came off, the French part of the coast.  The commander then ordered Rayner to, stand in, directing him, should any people be seen on shore, to hoist a, white flag, and land the four Frenchmen.\\n\\n\\\"No, no, mate, you was not aboard the _Arethusa_!\\\" cried Jack Peek, who, had followed his captain at a short distance, and looking Tom in the, face.  \\\"You was not aboard the _Arethusa_.  I'll tell you what kept you, down.  It was conceit, idleness, drink, and cowardice; and I'll tell you, what gave our brave captain his first lift in the service.  It was his, truthfulness, his good sense, his obedience to the orders of his, superiors.  It was his soberness, his bravery; and if you, with your, learning and advantages, had been like him, you too might have been in, command of a dashing frigate, and not stumping about on one wooden leg\\n\\nreceived him with great honour, and wrote a letter on his behalf to our, King James the Second, who on his return to England gave him a ship., This was his introduction to the British Navy, in which he served with, distinction in the reigns of William the Third and Queen Anne.  But his, obscure origin is the point here under notice, and the following, traditional anecdote is preserved in Shropshire:--When a boy he was left, in charge of the house by his mother, who went out marketing.  The, desire to go to sea, long cherished, was irresistible.  He stole forth\\n\\n\\\"I have brought you some food and a bottle of wine, mes garcons,\\\" she, said, in a kind tone.  \\\"The general gave me permission, and I was very, glad to bring it, as I knew that you must be hungry.  Poor boys!  I, heard of your attempt to get away.  You would have been drowned to a, certainty if you hadn't been caught, and that would have been sad, for, one of you, they say, wanted to get back to see his mother.  I have got, a son at sea, so I can feel for her.  I wish he was safe back again.  I, don't know what they will do with you, but I hear that you are to be, tried to-morrow, and the Irish officer here says you are spies, and if, so, you will run a great chance of being hung, or, at all events, shut, up in a prison till you confess what you have been about.  Ah! but I, forgot.  They say you don't speak French, and you may not have, understood a word I have said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought over the means by which I could best preserve my life.  I, knew that it would not do to show the slightest fear, so arousing, myself, I said, `My friends, you are hungry, so am I, but we can endure, another day without eating.  Now I want you to understand that we are, more likely to be saved by an English vessel than by one of any other, nation, as there are three times as many English cruisers in these seas, as there are French, and ten times as many merchantmen.  If we are, picked up by an English vessel, you are sure to be well treated for my, sake, but if any accident were to happen to me--if I were to fall, overboard, for instance--there would be no one to say a word in your, favour.  Remember that I was the means of saving the lives of two of, you, although, when I plunged into the water and swam to you at the risk, of being caught by a shark, or sinking myself from fatigue, I did not, expect any return.  I suppose that you do not wish to be ungrateful.'\\n\\nIn this he was disappointed.  The day went by; the ship still lay, motionless on the waste of waters.  Another night came on.  It was not, until the sun again rose that the sails were heard to give several loud, flaps against the masts; a few cat's-paws were seen playing over the, surface of the water, and at length the canvas swelled out to an, easterly breeze.  The tacks were hauled aboard, and the _Lily_ stood in, the direction it was supposed the _Ione_ would be found, over the course, she had just come.\\n\\nJack made much slower progress.  He could not, he said, twist his tongue, about sufficiently to get out the words, even when he remembered them., Some, he found, were wonderfully like English, and those he recollected, the best, though, to be sure, they had different meanings.  One day the, cutter had stood out farther from the shore than usual, her nets being, down, when, at daybreak, a strange sail was seen in the offing.  The, captain, after taking one look at her, was convinced that she was an, enemy.\\n\\nAn alarm was given that the mizenmast was on fire in the captain's, cabin, and as Rayner looked over the side, he could see the flames burst, out of the lee ports.  The guns had not been loaded, but there was no, necessity to fire signals of distress.  The condition of the ship could, be seen from far along the shore, and it was hoped that boats would, as, she drew near, put off to her assistance.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid, Captain Martin, that we cannot hope to save the ship,\\\" he, said; \\\"the fire may be kept under for an hour or perhaps two hours, but, if it once makes its way through the hatchways and gets to the lower, decks, there is nothing to stop it.  I would strongly advise that the, boats should at once be got ready, so that as many lives as possible may, be preserved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There may not be much fun in it, but it's very necessary,\\\" answered, Bill.  \\\"If the men were not to practise at the guns, how could they fire, away properly when we get alongside an enemy?  See! some of the fresh, hands don't seem to know much what they are about, or the lieutenant, would not be growling at them in the way he is doing.  I am keeping my, eye on the old hands to learn how they manage, and before long, I think\\n\\nThe Frenchmen and blacks, eager to save themselves, paid no attention to, what he said.  On flew the boat on the summit of a sea, and carried, forward, the next instant her keel struck the sand.  Regardless of his, advice, they all at the same moment sprang forward, each man trying to, be the first to get out of the boat.  He and Tom Fletcher held on to the, thwarts.\\n\\nhis sister, at great risk, brought us food.  He will now be amongst, strangers, who do not understand his lingo, and the poor fellow will be, very sad and solitary; so I think he would like it, if I could get leave, to go and stay with him while the frigate remains in harbour.  I'll take, it as a great favour, sir, since you ask me what reward I should like\\n\\n\\\"This address seemed to have some effect on the men I had saved.  Each, of them uttered an exclamation of approval, while the two others, who, still retained some little strength, turned aside their heads, not, daring to look at me.  I did not move until night came on, when I, crawled from the place I had occupied, and lay down between the two men, who seemed most disposed to befriend me.  In the middle of the night I, awoke, and finding that there was a light breeze.  I endeavoured to, kneel up and ascertain if providentially any vessel were approaching.\\n\\nwas standing forward on the look-out, and, as may be supposed, he did, not allow an eye to wink.  Several times he thought that he could see, two dark objects rising above the horizon, but his imagination might, have deceived him, for they, at all events, grew no larger.  When his, watch was over, he came aft into the midshipmen's berth, where several, of his messmates were collected.  He might have turned in, for the night, was drawing on, but there were still two hours to daylight.  He, as well, as others, dropped asleep with their heads on the table.\\n\\nand that some blacks, who knew the Englishmen, had accompanied the, soldiers to assist in finding them.  As soon as I heard this I hastily, put some of the things into my bag, not waiting for the remainder, and, hurried out of the hut.  As I did so, what was my dismay to see three of, the soldiers, accompanied by one of the black fellows who had escaped, from the wreck!  Were I to have run away they would have suspected me\\n\\n\\\"You mind, sir, how we got out of the prison in France, and I don't see, why we shouldn't get out of this place,\\\" observed Jack, going to one of, the two narrow windows which the room contained, and looking forth., They were strongly-barred.  The night was dark, and he could only see, the glimmer of a light here and there in the distance.  It was, impossible also to ascertain the height of the window from the ground.\\n\\n\\\"Then I'm sure he will like you; he could not help doing so.  He is only, three years older than I am; just about your age I suppose.  He went to, sea when he was a very little fellow with poor dear papa, who was killed, in action.  Oliver was by his side at the time, and wrote us home an, account of the sad, sad event, saying how brokenhearted he was.  The, people were very kind to him.  Papa was lieutenant of the ship, and was, loved by all the men, as I am sure he would have been, remembering how, good and kind and gentle he was with us.\\\"\\n\\nThe wind was fair, the sea calm, and the traders bound for Jamaica, safely reached Port Royal harbour, the remainder being convoyed to the, other islands by the _Latona_ and _Lily_, which were afterwards to be, sent to cruise in search of the enemy's privateers.  Our hero had not, forgotten Tom Fletcher, but watched in the hopes of doing him a service, Jack's report of him had not been favourable.  He had talked of going, home to his father, and had plenty of money in his pocket to do so, but, instead of that he had gone to dancing-houses and similar places, resorted to by seamen, where his money rapidly disappeared.  He might, have fallen into the docks, or died in the streets, had not Jack found, him and brought him on board the _Lily_.  For some neglect of duty his, leave had been stopped, and, fortunately for himself, he was not allowed, to go on shore at Port Royal when the ship put in there.  Tom, however\\n\\nThe frigate and her fresh prize were meantime making the best of their, way across the Channel.  As the latter, a fast sailor, was not, materially injured, all sail was made on her, and she kept good way with, the _Thisbe_.  At the same time there was still the risk of either one, or both being taken by a French ship of superior force, though neither, was likely to yield without making every effort to escape.  A constant, look-out was kept from the mast-head, but as the ships got farther and, farther from the French coast, the hope of escaping without having again, to fight increased.\\n\\nit was one of mourning to many who had lost relatives and friends.  The, dead were carried on shore to be buried, the wounded conveyed to, hospitals, the Frenchmen were landed and marched off under an escort of, marines to the prisons prepared for them, and press-gangs were soon busy, at work to obtain fresh hands to supply the places of those who had, fallen, although many prime seamen volunteered to serve on board a, frigate which had already won a name for herself.\\n\\nThe game, however, was not to be all on one side.  The Frenchmen's guns, were heard going off as fast as they could get their matches ready., They could easily be distinguished by the far louder noise they made., Those from the two other forts at the same time could be heard firing, away.  Cries and shrieks rose from wounded men, and a loud explosion, as, if a gun had burst, rent the air.\\n\\n\\\"I only did my duty without thinking of being rewarded,\\\" answered Bill;, \\\"but I have been wishing since we took the prize that something could be, done for a young Frenchman who was badly hurt on board her by a shot, from the battery which fired at us.  He and his father saved Jack Peek, and me from drowning when we were blown up in the _Foxhound_, and his, family were afterwards very kind to us, and did their utmost to save us, from being carried off to prison, and when we were hid away in a cave\\n\\nhoping to get in shore of her and back to Cherbourg.  At once the, _Thisbe_ was put about, and then stood so as to cross the stranger's, bows.  The latter, on seeing this, hoisting French colours, rapidly, shortened sail and hauled up to the northward, the two ships crossing, each other on contrary tacks.  The _Thisbe_ fired her starboard, broadside, receiving one in return, and then going about, endeavoured to, get to windward of her antagonist.  This, however, she was unable to do\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, sir,\\\" said Jack; \\\"but, you see, to get it I must read and, write, and that's what I never could tackle.  I have tried pothooks and, hangers, but my fingers get all cramped up, and the pen splits open, and, I have to let it drop, and make a great big splash of ink on the paper;, and as for reading, I've tried that too.  I know all the letters when I, see them, but I can't manage to put them together in the right fashion\\n\\na neat cottage standing by itself in a small garden.  A pretty little, girl about thirteen years of age opened the door, and on seeing the, strangers summoned her mother, who at once appeared, and led the way to, the room she had prepared for Pierre's reception.  It was on the, ground-floor, and contained a dimity-covered bed, and a few other simple, articles of furniture, quite sufficient for all the young French, sailor's wants.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll help you.  You can show me what we had best do,\\\" said Jack., \\\"I am not going to draw back on account of the risk.  All must depend on, the weather.  If the wind comes off shore, and the sea goes down, I, should say that our best chance would be to build a raft.  We can do, that, if we can only find an axe and a saw, and we might get launched, before the Frenchmen find out the wreck.  The first thing we have to do, is to get on board, and when we are there, we must keep a bright, look-out to see that none of the natives are coming along the shore to, trap us.\\\"\\n\\nBill had a more imaginative mind, which was seldom altogether at rest., He fancied sometimes that he was escaping from the top of the tower, and, tumbling head over heels to the bottom; at others that he was running, along, with the Frenchmen shouting after him to stop.  Then he fancied, that one with a long pair of legs had overtaken him, and was grasping, him tightly by the arm.\\n\\nThe ticking of one of the mattresses was quickly cut up and formed into, a line, which was lowered.  Rayner, who held it, felt a gentle tug, and, as he hauled it up, what was the delight of the party to find two strong, files!  There could be no doubt that Le Duc had formed some plan to, assist them in escaping, or he would not have come thus furnished., Probably they had to thank Madame La Roche for suggesting it.  They did, not stop, however, to discuss the matter, but set to work immediately to, file away the bars, making as little noise as possible.  While two of, them were thus employed, the rest walked about the room, and talked and, laughed and sang, so as to drown the sound of the files.  Presently they, heard from the other side of the building the loud tones of a fiddle\\n\\nMany looked at the stranger with anxious eyes; the flag of France was, flying from her peak.  Eighteen guns grinned out from her ports on, either side--twice the number of those carried by the _Lily_, and of a, far heavier calibre.  As she got within range she opened fire, her shot, flying through the _Lily's_ sails, cutting her rigging and injuring, several of her spars, but her guns were so elevated that not a man was, hit on deck.\\n\\nThe sailors received the prize with astonishment and cheers of approval., The Admiral being told of the exploit, sent for Hopson and thus, addressed him, \\\"My lad, I believe you to be a brave youth.  From this, day I order you to walk the quarter-deck, and if your future conduct is, equally meritorious, you shall have my patronage and protection.\\\", Hopson made every effort to maintain the good opinion of his patron, and, by his conduct and attention to duty gained the respect of the officers, of the ship.  He afterwards went rapidly through the different ranks of, the service, till at length he attained that of Admiral.\\n\\n\\\"Get up, old fellow, and defend yourself,\\\" cried Brown.  \\\"I'm not the, chap to strike a man when he's down;\\\" and as he spoke he picked up the, officer's sword, and, helping him to his feet, presented it to him.  All, this was done so rapidly that Rayner and his companions arrived only, just in time to prevent Brown, who had stepped back a few paces, from, making a lunge with his bayonet at the astonished Frenchman, who, now, seeing an officer, though he did not recognise Rayner, again cried out, that he surrendered, and skipping out of Brown's way offered his sword.\\n\\nwith which he stood ready to heave when he should be near enough.  But, he felt his own strength failing.  It seemed almost beyond his power to, reach the wreck.  Still, it was not in his nature to give in, and making, a desperate effort, striking out through the surging waters, he clutched, the rope which Oliver hove-to him, and the next instant was clambering, on board.  Throwing himself down on the deck, he endeavoured to regain, his strength, Oliver grasping him tightly with one hand, while he held, to the stanchion with the other.\\n\\nIn a short time, making their way through the jungle, and crossing a, small stream which would afford them water, they saw before them a huge, tree, upturned from the roots, forming beneath it a cavern of, considerable size, which Le Duc and Tom were engaged in clearing out., There was a risk of being bitten by snakes, which might have made it, their abode, but that could not be avoided.  Le Duc was running his, stick into every hole he could see to drive out any which might be, concealed.  In other respects, no better place could be found.\\n\\nSuddenly he recognised Captain Rayner, who, from being dressed in plain, clothes, he had not at first observed.  He started, and then began, with, an impudent leer, \\\"Now, mates, I'll spin you another yarn about an, English captain who now holds his head mighty high, and would not, condescend to speak to poor Jack if he was to meet him.  We was, powder-monkeys together, that captain and I.  But luck is everything., He went up, and I went down.  That's the way at sea.  If all men had, their deserts I should be where he is, in command of a fine frigate, in, a fair way of becoming an admiral.  But it's no use complaining, and so, I'll sing on--\\n\\n\\\"I was raising myself on my elbow when I saw one of the men who had, threatened me by their words creeping towards me.  I instantly awoke my, two friends, for so I will call them, by exclaiming, `There is a breeze., Perhaps a vessel is approaching us.  We should not be sleeping;' while, the man whom I suspected of a design against my life drew back and lay, perfectly still.  I determined not again to fall asleep, if I could, avoid it, until daylight.  I believe, however, that I frequently dropped, off, but I was preserved.  When morning dawned, I discovered that the, man who had, as I believed, intended to kill me was utterly unable to, move.  The other fellow, however, seemed to be the strongest of the, party.  He got up, and stretching out his arms, exclaimed, addressing, his countrymen--\\n\\n\\\"Well, my boy, I will keep an eye on you,\\\" said the captain.  \\\"Mr, Saltwell, you will see what is best to be done with William Rayner,\\\" he, added, turning to the first lieutenant.  \\\"If you wish to learn to read, and write, you can come and get instruction every day from my clerk, Mr, Finch.  I will give him directions to teach you; but remember you are, not forced to do it.\\\"\\n\\nThe mess-tins were stowed away, and the watch hastened on deck.  The, wind by this time had somewhat freshened, and the frigate and her prize, were making better progress than before.  The strangers, however, which, had appeared in sight in the morning were considerably nearer.  A fourth, was now seen beyond the three which had been made out to the eastward., The ship to the westward which was considerably farther off than the, others, was evidently a large vessel, and the captain declared his, belief that she was a line-of-battle ship, but whether English or, French, it was impossible to decide.  He hoped, as did everybody on, board, that she was English, for should she prove to be French, as, undoubtedly were the vessels to the eastward, the _Thisbe_ would lose, her hard-won prize, even though she might manage to escape herself., Still, Captain Martin was not a man to give up hope while there was a, chance of escape.\\n\\nJack, with the rest of those who had been wounded, had been sent to the, hospital.  Rayner the next day obtained leave to visit him.  He was, sorry for Tom, who was thus left very much to his own resources, and he, tried to find an opportunity of speaking a kind word to his former, companion; but Tom, as before, sulkily kept aloof, so that he was, compelled to leave him to himself.  He was very sorry, soon after, to, see him being led along the deck by the master-at-arms.  Tom looked, dreadfully downcast and frightened.\\n\\nBill was not quite consistent in taking the cloth when he would not, touch the money, but it did not occur to him for a moment that he was, wrong in appropriating it, or he would have refused to do so.  Had he, argued the point, he would have found it very difficult to settle.  One, thing was certain, that the owners were never likely to make any, complaint on the subject.\\n\\nStill, hour after hour went by, and no enemy appearing, they began to, fear that the Frenchmen would get into port before they could be, overtaken.  At length, just before the sun reached the horizon, his rays, fell on the royals and topgallantsails of two ships right ahead.  As the, sun sank lower they were again lost to view, but their appearance, revived the hopes of all on board.  It was not likely that they would, alter their course during the night, and it was hoped, therefore, that, before morning they would be overtaken.  It was not likely that the, _Thisbe_ and _Venus_, being in the shadow, would have been perceived.\\n\\n\\\"There may be some difficulty in doing as you propose,\\\" replied the, captain.  \\\"Mr Saltwell will, however, I have no doubt, try to make a, satisfactory arrangement, for a person behaving as the young Frenchman, has done deserves to be rewarded; but that is not what I meant; I want, you to choose some reward for yourself, and wish you to let me know how, I can best serve you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It may be a hard job to do that,\\\" said Jack; \\\"and I should say it would, be easier to run off with a boat or some small craft which we two could, handle, and make our way in her across Channel.  I know where to find, the polar star.  I have often been out at night when father steered by, it, and we should be sure, some time or other, to make the English, coast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lads!\\\" cried the commander, who had observed some of them wavering as, they gazed with looks of alarm at their powerful enemy, \\\"most of you, have sailed in the _Lily_ with me since she was first commissioned.  You, know that I have never exposed your lives unnecessarily, and that we, have always succeeded in whatever we have undertaken.  You have gained a, name for yourselves and our ship, and I hope you will not sully that, name by showing the white feather.  Although yonder ship is twice as big, as we are, still we must try to beat her off, and it will not be my, fault if we don't.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the soldiers stepped aside and two black seamen were led, forward.  Rayner recognised them as the most ruffianly of the schooner's, crew.  First one, and then the other, swore that the vessel had been, sent to the coast for the purpose of landing some French spies, that the, schooner was to wait for them, and then when they had gained information, as to the strength of the forts and vessels in the harbours they were to, return to the frigate.\\n\\nI suppose, before long, get another step; and here am I sticking where I, was.  It's no fault of mine, that I can see.  I'll cut and run if I have, the chance, for I cannot bear to see others placed over my head, as you, and Bill Rayner have been, and to see him walking the quarter-deck in a, brand new uniform, and talking to the officers as friendly and easy as, if he had been born among them, while I, a gentleman's son, remain a, foremast man, with every chance of being one to the end of my days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we do we must manage to get out somehow or other, as we did before,\\\", answered Bill; \\\"but even if they do come up with us, that's no reason, why we should be taken.  We must try and beat them off, and the captain, and Mr Saltwell are the men to do it.  They are only four to our two, ships, for the lieutenant in charge of the prize will fight his guns as, well as we do ours.\\\"\\n\\nIt took upwards of an hour before the prisoners with their bags and, other personal property were removed to the _Foxhound_.  Captain Waring, and Lieutenant Saltwell turned their eyes pretty often towards the, harbour.  No ships were seen coming out of it.  The English frigate and, her two prizes consequently steered in the direction the other vessels, had gone, the captain hoping to pick up one or more of them during the, following morning.  Her diminished crew had enough to do in attending to, their proper duties, and in looking after the prisoners.\\n\\nwonders can be worked.  How I did bamboozle those stupid fellows!  It, was fortunate, however, that none of the black crew of the schooner or, my late shipmates appeared, or I should have been discovered.  Now, put, on these dresses, they are such as are worn by the planters of this, country, and you can pretend you are going to a fair at Goave to buy, mules, that is what Francois advises, and he has got a good head on his, shoulders.  I wish that he could have come with us, but as soon as he, had deposited these clothes he had to ride back as fast as he could to, attend to his mistress, and I undertook the rest.\\\"\\n\\naccording to the surveyor's report, it would take some months to put her, in thorough repair, and that in the meantime he had been appointed to, the command of the store-ship _Bombay Castle_, of sixty-four guns, bound, for the Mediterranean, and he should take his officers and crew with, him.  \\\"We all of us might wish for more active service, my lads, but we, shall not be long absent, and I hope by the time we come back that we, shall find our tight little frigate as ready for any duty she may be, sent on, as you all, I am sure, will be.\\\"\\n\\nAs it was growing dusk, Bill had no fear of being seen as he made his, way from the cavern.  He felt rather weak, but he had a brave heart, and, pushed on.  He had some rough rocks to climb over, and others he managed, to get round, walking through the water where it was not too deep., Sooner than he expected he reached the bay near which the Turgots', cottage was situated.  To avoid the other cottages and huts he had to, make a wide circuit.\\n\\nThe sea dashing over the reef, though spent of its fury, still broke, with great force against the hull of the schooner.  Her timbers shook, and quivered as wave after wave, striking them, rolled on towards the, beach, and then came hissing back, covering the surface of the lagoon, with a mass of creaming foam.  The coast, as far as could be seen, through the masses of spray, looked barren and uninviting.\\n\\nAs soon as this had been accomplished sufficiently to make sail, the, _Thisbe_, brought to the wind, stood after the flying enemy, firing her, bow chasers as she did so; but it was soon seen that she had little, chance of coming up with them.  Still her captain persevered; but, with, both masts and spars wounded, it was impossible to carry as much sail as, would otherwise have been done.  Consequently, before long the, line-of-battle ship, which made the signal _Terrible_, seventy-four\\n\\nThe raft was quickly cast loose, and, getting out the oars, they began, to paddle silently down the harbour.  They could not avoid making some, slight noise, but they hoped that there was no one on the watch to hear, it.  Very frequently they turned their glances astern to ascertain if, they were followed, but they could see nothing moving.  There were, several vessels lower down the harbour, so they steered a course which, would carry them past at some little distance from them.\\n\\nThe captain directed Rayner to keep astern of the other boats.  His eye, rested on his ship as if he desired to see her as long as she existed., The moment of her destruction came at last.  The rest of the crew having, landed, the yawl was nearing the shore, when a loud roar was heard as if, a whole broadside had been fired.  The flames rose high in the air; the, masts shot upwards surrounded by burning fragments of planks and, timbers; the stout sides, rent asunder, rushed outwards, and in another, minute a few blackened fragments of the gallant ship, which had that, morning floated trim and proudly on the ocean, were alone visible.\\n\\nOur hero spent a few happy days with the kind widow and Mary, who both, evidently took a warm interest in his welfare.  It was the first time he, had been living on shore, except during his sojourn in France, since he, first went to sea.  He was introduced to some of the few friends they, possessed, and he made several pleasant excursions with them to visit, some of the beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood of Plymouth.  His, observation, unknown to himself, enabled him rapidly to adapt himself to, the manners of people of education, and no one would have recognised in, the gentlemanly young midshipman the powder monkey of a short time back., It was with more regret than he supposed he could possibly have felt, that he received a summons to join the _Lily_, now fitting out with all, despatch for the West Indies.  Though he no longer belonged to the, _Thisbe_, it was with much sorrow that he heard she was pronounced unfit, for sea, and that her crew had been dispersed.  He made inquiries for, Jack and Tom.  The former, he discovered, had gone to pay his mother a, visit; but, though he searched for Tom, he could nowhere hear of him.\\n\\nMadame La Roche, coming in, took the head of the table, and the young, ladies, sailing like swans into the room, placed themselves by the side, of their guests, on the strangeness of whose costumes they made not the, slightest remark.  Rayner and Oliver had become somewhat faint from long, fasting, but their spirits quickly revived after they had eaten some of, the viands placed before them.  At first they supposed that the repast, was served up solely on their account, but from the way the girls and, their mother kept them in countenance, they were satisfied that they had, simply come in for the family supper.\\n\\n\\\"I am ready to believe the account you give me, and that you certainly, are not spies,\\\" he said.  \\\"The body of your countryman found on the, beach proves that you were shipwrecked.  Still, as you are in the, country, we must consider you as prisoners of war, and treat you as, such.  For this night you must remain here, and to-morrow I will, consider whether I will send you to Leogane or Le Trou, where you will, wait with others of your countrymen to be exchanged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The lads do not understand French, that is evident,\\\" said the officer, to a subordinate standing near him; \\\"I shall get nothing out of them, without an interpreter.  They do not look stupid either, and they must, be bold fellows, or they would not have attempted to made a voyage on, that raft.  I must have a nearer look at it;\\\" and he ordered the boatmen, to bring it in close to the shore, so that he might examine it.\\n\\nBill therefore had to wait till he could make his way on deck without, being remarked.  Pretending to drop asleep, he lay perfectly quiet for, some time; then sitting up and rubbing his eyes, he staggered away, forward, as if still drowsy, to make it be supposed that he was about to, turn into his hammock.  Finding that he was unobserved, he crept up by, the fore-hatchway, where he found Dick, who was in the watch off deck.\\n\\nAn order was passed along the decks that not a gun should be fired till, the captain gave the word.  The boys had not forgotten their fight a few, weeks before, and had an idea that this was to turn out something like, that.  Then the shot of the enemy had passed between the masts and the, rigging; but scarcely one had struck the hull, nor had a man been hurt\\n\\n\\\"No doubt about that, youngster,\\\" answered Ben Twinch, the boatswain's, mate, who overheard Tom's remark.  \\\"What do you think we come to sea, for?  If we can take a man-of-war of our own size she's worth half a, dozen merchant craft, though, to be sure, some of us may lose the number, of our mess; but we all know that, and make no count of it.  Maybe, you'll have your head taken off one of these days, and if you do, you'll, only share the fate of many another fine fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quick, lads, quick, and I'll try to get hold of one or both of them, if, I can,\\\" cried Ben, fastening the rope round his body.  His example was, followed by another man, who, in the same way, secured a rope round, himself, when both plunged in and seized the well-nigh drowning, strangers, just as, utterly exhausted, they had let go their hold.  They, were able, however, to speak, and Rayner discovered that they were, French.\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you what it is, Mr Rayner,\\\" exclaimed Ben; \\\"no man who, hasn't been down to the bottom of Stromboli or down Etna will be able to, live two minutes in the cockpit, and I cannot help you, sir, to throw, your life away.  The ship's on fire somewhere forward, and what we've, got to do is to pump the water over it, and try and put it out.  If we, can't do that, we must shut down the hatches, and see if we can't, smother it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am very sorry for it,\\\" remarked Oliver; \\\"for from the experience I, have had of them, I think it more than possible, if they can get the, assistance of the black crew, they will try and play us some scurvy, trick.  I have not hitherto pointed out the fellow who tried to take my, life, and who was so nearly dying himself; but I suspect his disposition, has not altered for the better.  You'll fancy me somewhat suspicious\\n\\nand recollected that the success of the undertaking might considerably, depend upon him.  The night was very dark, but as the boats got up to, the mouth of the harbour the lights on shore could be distinguished, as, well as several on board vessels at anchor.  The boats kept clear of the, latter, lest any of their people might discover them and give the alarm., The barge led, the launch and cutter following in succession.  The, success of the undertaking would depend on their being able to take the, enemy by surprise.\\n\\ndischarging her broadside, she raked the _Thisbe_ fore and aft.  In vain, the latter tried to escape from her critical position; before she could, do so she was a second time raked, the gaff being shot away, the, mizenmast injured, and the remaining rigging cut through and through., Fortunately, the _Thisbe_ still answered her helm, and the crew were, endeavouring to make sail, when the enemy ranged up on the starboard, quarter, her forecastle being covered with men, evidently intending to, board.\\n\\n\\\"That's just it, sir.  If two small boys could get out of a French, prison, I am thinking that five well-nigh grown men can manage the job., We'll do it, sir, never fear.  If this stone was granite it might puzzle, us, but it's softer than that by a long way, and I have already cut out, some of it with my knife, though, to be sure, it does blunt it, considerably.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You acted rightly, Captain Dupont,\\\" said the general.  \\\"Let them be, brought to my quarters, and I'll send for Colonel O'Toole to, cross-question them.\\\"  Bill and Jack understood every word that was, said.  \\\"We are in for it,\\\" said Bill; \\\"but we must put a bold face on, the matter, and speak the truth.  We can say that we were living in the, cavern for some time, and that when the brig was wrecked, we resolved at, once to build a raft, and get back to our own country.\\\"\\n\\nOur hero had now got the first step up the ratlines as an officer.  As, the _Lily's_ repairs were likely to occupy some time, Captain Saltwell, had, by the admiral's permission, fitted out one of the prizes, a fine, and fast little schooner, to which the name of the _Active_ had been, given.  He intended to man her from his own and the _Ariel's_ crews, and, to send her cruising in search of the piratical craft which, under the, guise of privateers, in vast numbers infested those seas.\\n\\nThe captain had not forgotten Bill, who, by the timely information he, had given, had materially contributed to preserve the ship from capture., Bill himself did not think that he had done anything wonderful; his, chief anxiety was lest the fact of his having given the information, should become known.  The sentinel might guess at it, but otherwise the, captain alone could know anything about it.  Bill, as soon as he had, told his story to the captain, and found that it was credited, stole, away forward among the rest of the crew on deck, where he took very good, care not to say a word of what had happened; so that not till the, trustworthy men received orders to be prepared for an outbreak were they, aware of what was likely to occur.\\n\\n\\\"I'll try it, sir,\\\" cried Ben Twinch, the boatswain's mate, one of the, most powerful men in the ship.  \\\"I'd like, howsomdever, to have a line, round my waist.  Do you stand by, mates, and haul me back if I don't, make way; there are some ugly bits of timber floating about, and one of, them may give me a lick on the head, and I shan't know what's, happening.\\\"\\n\\nAs they got higher up, the sound of voices came off the shore, as if the, people were laughing and making merry.  This gave Mr Saltwell hopes, that many of the crew were landed, and that those on board would be, totally unprepared for an attack.  He intended to board on the starboard, quarter, and he had given directions to the other officers, one to board, on the larboard quarter and the other at the main chains, his object, being to overpower the resistance the officer's would make aft, then to, sweep the decks until the forecastle was gained.  One of the boats was, immediately to shove ahead and cut the cable, while certain of the men, had been directed to hoist the headsails, so that the prize might\\n\\nHis only regret now was that he could no longer talk with Jack and Tom, as he had been accustomed to do, though he hoped that he should still be, able, without doing anything derogatory to his new position, to speak to, them in a friendly way.  Thinking highly of Jack as he did, he regretted, more than ever that his former messmate could neither read nor write., He felt sure that he would, should he have an opportunity, do something, to merit promotion.\\n\\nAs soon as Rayner got up, by Francois' directions he shut down the, trapdoor.  There was just light sufficient, through a pane of glass in, the roof, to see that the loft extended over a considerable portion of, the building.  Part only was covered with boards, on which, according to, the instructions given them, they laid down.  Francois had charged them, on no account to move about, lest they should be heard by the people, below.  The planks, however, were not placed very close together, and, after they had been there a minute or so, Rayner discovered a glimmer of, light coming through a broadish chink.\\n\\nJudging by the still louder scraping of Le Duc's fiddle, he must have, suspected what they were about.  Oliver could hear the notes coming, round from the other side of the building.  All, however, below him was, silence and darkness.  He could not judge, as he looked down, whether he, was to alight on hard or soft ground, whether into a ditch or stream, or, whether they should have a fence to climb.  His chief fear was that some, of the dogs allowed to go loose in every country house might discover, him and his companions before they could effect their escape.\\n\\nHe went on, keeping his gaze ahead, in the hopes of meeting Jack.  He, was sorry that he had not made more determined attempts to persuade, Captain Turgot and Pierre to accompany him; for if anything should have, happened to his companion, they would have assisted him.  But what could, have happened? that was the question.  Sometimes he thought that Jack, might, after all, not have come to the cavern; but, then, who could have, carried away the basket?\\n\\n\\\"I considered how I could best preserve my life, as I thought it very, possible that you would send the privateer to the bottom should she not, yield or try to escape.  I determined, should I find her sinking, to, leap out through one of the stern windows of the captain's cabin.  I, accordingly made my way there, and was looking out for some instrument, with which to force open the window when I saw smoke curling up through, an opening in the deck below me.  I at once knew that it must arise from, a spot at no great distance from the magazine.  In the hopes of inducing, the commander to send some men down to try and extinguish the fire, before it was too late, I sprang on deck.  Scarcely had I reached it\\n\\n\\\"Well, we will soon see all about that,\\\" said the colonel, beginning to, search Bill; but, greatly to his surprise, he found nothing whatever, about him, except his knife, the whole of Bill's worldly wealth, \\\"I told, you so, sir,\\\" said Bill, when he had finished.  \\\"I spoke only the truth, about myself and my companion.\\\"  Bill said this, hoping that Jack would, escape the search; but the colonel was far too knowing, and presently he, seized upon Jack, who, in spite of his efforts to appear unconcerned\\n\\n\\\"At daylight I awoke.  The sea was calm.  I gazed anxiously around.  Not, a speck was visible in the horizon.  The sun rose, and its rays beat, down upon us with even greater fury than on the previous day, or, at all, events, I suffered more, as did my companions.  They now cried out for, water and food, and I saw them eye me with savage looks.  I pretended, not to observe this, and said that I hoped and thought that we might, catch some fish or birds.\\n\\n\\\"They have heard me talking French to the officers, and will be careful, what they say when they see me near them,\\\" answered Bill; \\\"but there's, my messmate, Jack Peek, who was in France with me, and knows their, `lingo' as well as I do; and as they have not heard him talking, they'll, not suspect him; and if you will allow me, sir, I will tell him to go, among them, and he'll soon find out if they have any thoughts of, mischief.\\\"\\n\\nThe _Thisbe_ was in too crippled a condition to follow.  Several shot, had passed between wind and water on both sides.  One gun on the, quarter-deck and two on the maindeck were dismounted, and almost all the, tackles and breachings were cut away.  The maindeck before the mainmast, was torn up from the waterway to the hatchways, and the bits were shot, away, as was the chief part of the gangways.  Not an officer had been, killed, but two midshipmen, the master, and gunner, were wounded., Twenty men were wounded and eleven lost the number of their mess.\\n\\nThe British crew, working with redoubled energy, hauled their guns in, and out, and fired with wonderful rapidity, truly tossing them about as, if they had been playthings.  The French also fired, but far more, slowly, sending hardly one shot to the _Lily's_ two.  The officers went, about the deck encouraging the men and laying hold of the tackles to, assist them in their labours.  At any moment a well-directed broadside, from the frigate might leave the corvette a mere wreck on the ocean, or, send her to the bottom.  Every man on board knew this; but while their, officers kept their flag flying at the peak, they were ready to work, their guns and struggle to the last.\\n\\nalthough the flames had not yet burst out, it became of the greatest, importance to get the powder out of the magazine.  For this purpose the, second lieutenant descended with a party of men, and succeeded in, bringing up a considerable quantity, which was stowed in the stern, gallery.  All the other hands, not otherwise employed, were engaged, under the different officers in heaving water down the hatchways; but, the smoke increased to such a degree that they were compelled to desist\\n\\nand at length it was found that the powder could be drawn, up and hove, overboard out of the gallery windows.  Several of the officers, volunteered for this dangerous duty.  Rayner, notwithstanding that he, had just before escaped suffocation, again twice descended, and was each, time drawn up more dead than alive.  Several hours had now gone by, and, the wind providentially holding fair, the ship was nearing the land., Meantime, the fire was fast gaining on them, and might at any moment, triumph over all the heroic efforts of the crew to subdue it.  The heat, below was intense.  The first lieutenant, going forward, found that the, hatches had been blown off, as also the tarpaulins placed over the, gratings.  As it was of the greatest importance to keep them on, he, directed the carpenter, with as many men as could be obtained, to, replace them, while he returned once more aft, to superintend the, operation of getting up the powder.\\n\\nExpressions of gratitude rose from the lips of the Frenchmen when Rayner, had translated what Captain Martin had said.  The magistrate then, offered to receive as many as his own house could accommodate, as did, two gentlemen who had accompanied him, their example being followed by, other persons, and before morning the whole of the shipwrecked seamen, were housed, including three or four officers, the only ones saved.  The, poor fellows endeavoured by every way in their power to show how, grateful they were for the kindness they were receiving.\\n\\n\\\"You'll not do that,\\\" answered Rayner, knowing very well that Tom did, not dream of putting his threat into execution; \\\"but I'll tell the first, lieutenant what you say about your wish to see your family, though I, fear it will not influence him in recommending the captain to remit your, punishment.  I would advise you, whatever happens, to submit, and to, try, by doing your duty, to gain a good name for yourself,\\\" said Rayner\\n\\n\\\"I know that, well enough; but it was my brother who answered the, letter; and, as my father is a clever man, I daresay by this time he has, become rich again, and, for very shame at having a son of his a common, ship's boy, would do as I wish.  Can't you tell the captain that, and, perhaps he'll excuse me the flogging?  It's very hard to be prevented, seeing my family, and to be flogged into the bargain.  It's more than I, can bear, and I've a great mind to jump overboard and drown myself when, I get my wrists out of these irons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I will never allow that,\\\" was the answer.  \\\"We'll get you along a, little farther, until we can find some place to rest in.  There's a wood, I see ahead, and we must conceal ourselves in it until you are able to, go on again.  If Mr Crofton likes to lead on the rest and try to get, across the frontier, he may do so, but I'll stick by you, Jack.  Don't, be afraid.\\\"\\n\\nBill was anxious to get back to poor Jack, who he remembered was, well-nigh starving.  Jeannette would have accompanied him part of the, way, but she had to remain at home to receive Captain Turgot and Pierre., She had, in the meantime, packed a basket with provisions for Jack and, himself, that they might be independent for a couple of days.  He, therefore jumped up, and, begging her to remember him very kindly to the, others, he bade her farewell, and, with the basket on his arm, slipped, out of the house as cautiously as he had entered.\\n\\nHe had a short time before come off with a party of men returning on the, expiration of their leave.  Telling them that he wished to go to sea, he, had been allowed to enter the boat.  From the questions some of them had, put to him, and the answers he gave, they suspected that he was a, runaway, and such in fact was the case.  Tom was the son of a solicitor, in a country town, who had several other boys, he being the fourth, in, the family.\\n\\nNo steamboats ploughed the ocean, nor were railroads thought of, when, our young friends Jack, Tom, and Bill lived.  They first met each other, on board the _Foxhound_ frigate, on the deck of which ship a score of, other lads and some fifty or sixty men were mustered, who had just come, up the side from the _Viper_ tender; she having been on a cruise to, collect such stray hands as could be found; and a curious lot they were, to look at.\\n\\nThough sorry to leave his kind friends, Bill was very glad to be at sea, again, and engaged in the active duties of his profession.  His, messmates treated him with much kindness, and remarked among themselves, the improvement in his manners, while two or three fresh members of the, mess, when they heard how he had gained his promotion, looked upon him, with evident respect.  He did not, however, forget his old friends, and, Jack was always pleased when he came forward to talk to him, and did not, appear at all jealous, which could not be said of Tom, who, though he, did not venture to show his feelings, was inclined to keep out of his, way, and sometimes answered in rather a surly tone when spoken to\\n\\nAfter marching about a couple of miles, they reached a small town, or, village rather, the houses being scattered along the shores of another, bay much larger than the one they had left.  A river of some size ran, into the bay, and on a point of land near the mouth, on a height, stood, an old tower, which had been built, apparently, for the purpose of, guarding the entrance.\\n\\nof the cavern; still he thought, \\\"I must have the gold.  It would be so, foolish to go away without it.  It belongs to us as much as to anybody, else, seeing that the owners are dead.  Their ghosts won't come to look, for it, I hope.  I wish I hadn't thought of that.  I must be going, right.  It would have been much pleasanter if Bill had been with me., Why didn't I try to persuade him to stop?\\\"\\n\\nAll this passed through his mind as he was letting himself down the, rope, to which he clung with arms and feet as a sailor only can cling, with security.  He soon reached the bottom.  The ground appeared to be, firm, and was, as far as he could judge, perfectly level.  The tower, threw a dark shadow, in which he stood listening for any sounds which, might indicate danger.  It had been agreed, even should one or two of, the gendarmes come round, to spring upon them, seize their arms, and gag, them.  As soon as his feet touched the ground, he pulled out his, handkerchief, ready for the latter object.  Presently another came down., It was Brown, the best man to tackle an enemy, as his muscular strength, was equal to any two of the rest.  No enemy appeared, however, and at, length Rayner, who came last, reached the bottom in safety.\\n\\nHe got back safely, and the food he brought soon restored the spirits of, the party.  Even Jack declared that he was strong enough to walk a dozen, miles if necessary.  They were in great hopes, therefore, of getting, across the border before daybreak.  They regretted greatly the loss of, Le Duc, who had served them so faithfully, especially as they feared, that he himself was in danger of suffering in consequence of the, assistance he had given them.\\n\\n\\\"William Rayner,\\\" said the captain, \\\"you have, I understand, behaved, remarkably well on several occasions, twice especially, by saving Mr, Saltwell's life through your coolness and presence of mind.  You are, also, I find, a fair French scholar, and the first lieutenant reports, favourably of your conduct in your former ship.  I wish to reward you., Let me know how I can best do so in a way satisfactory to yourself.\\\"\\n\\nThe manoeuvre was repeated several times, causing the frigate to lose, ground; but a fortunate shot would have enabled her quickly to regain, it.  Though several of the _Thisbe's_ shot took effect, the chase, continued her course, firing in return from a gun run out astern; but, none of the shot struck her pursuer.  At last, however, the chase ran, past the battery, which shortly afterwards opened fire.  Captain Martin, returned it with such effect that two of the guns were silenced, when, the frigate's head was put off shore, and she stood away to avoid the, risk of being becalmed should the wind fall, as was very likely, towards, evening.\\n\\neven at spring-tide, with the wind off shore, the water might not reach, to where they sat; yet should a gale blow from the northward, it might, drive the waves far up the cavern, and expose them to great danger.  \\\"We, cannot tell what may happen,\\\" he said, \\\"and it's as well to be prepared, for the worst.  Besides, if the soldiers come to look for us, they may, find the mouth of the cavern, and make their way some distance in, but, if they do not discover us they'll fancy we are not here, and go away, again as wise as they came.\\\"\\n\\nJack Peek had probably never made so long a speech in his life.  It was, perhaps too long, for it enabled the old sailor to recover his presence, of mind, and looking at Jack with a brazen countenance, he declared that, he had never seen him before, when off he went as fast as he could walk, on his wooden stumps, and turning down a by-lane was lost to view.\\n\\nSome more bread and water was brought them in the morning, and a similar, unpalatable meal was provided in the afternoon.  This was evidently to, be their only food during their imprisonment.  They had no one to, complain to, no means of obtaining redress; so, like wise men, they made, up their minds to bear it, though Tom grumbled and growled all day long, at the way in which he was treated.\\n\\nSupper was quickly got through, and each man stowed away the remainder, of the provisions in his pockets.  While they went to work with their, knives at the bars, Rayner and Oliver examined the beds.  They were, thankful to find that the canvas at the bottom was lashed by pieces of, tolerably stout rope.  These, with the aid of the ticking cut into, strips, would form a line of sufficient length and strength to enable, them to descend, should they succeed in getting out the bars.  This\\n\\nThe next morning the gruff voice of the boatswain's mate summoned all, hands to turn out, and on going on deck they saw \\\"Blue Peter\\\" flying at, the fore, while shortly afterwards the Jews and all other visitors were, made to go down the side into the boats waiting for them.  The captain, came on board, the sails were loosed, and while the fife was setting up, a merry tune, the seamen tramped round at the capstan bars, and the, anchor was hove up.\\n\\nlifted the vessel, and driving over the ledge on which she had first, struck, carried her between some dark rocks, till she stuck fast on the, sandy shore.  Had the people been able to cling to her till now, some, might possibly have been saved, but they had apparently all been on deck, when the vessel struck, and been swept away by the first sea which, rolled over her.  The seas still continued to sweep along her deck, but, their force was partly broken by the rocks, and being evidently a stout, vessel, she hung together.\\n\\nTalking the matter over, it was objected that such a story might offend, peaceable folk, because it must deal too much with blood and gunpowder., Mr Kingston, although famed as a narrator of sea-fights, was a lover of, peace, and he said that his story would not encourage the war spirit., Those who cared chiefly to read about battles might turn to the pages of, \\\"British Naval History.\\\"  He chose the period of the great war for his, story, because it was a time of stirring events and adventures.  The, main part of the narrative belongs to the early years of life, in which, boys would feel most interest and sympathy.  And throughout the tale\\n\\nThe inventions of modern science and art are producing a great change in, all that pertains to life at sea.  The revolution is more apparent in, war than in peace.  There is, and always will be, a large proportion of, merchant ships under sail, even in nations like our own where steam is, in most general use.  In war, a wooden ship without steam and without, armour would be a mere floating coffin.  The fighting _Temeraire_, and, the saucy _Arethusa_, and Nelson's _Victory_ itself, would be nothing, but targets for deadly fire from active and irresistible foes.  The odds, would be about the same as the odds of javelins and crossbows against, modern fire-arms.  Steam alone had made a revolution in naval warfare;, but when we add to this the armour-plating of vessels, and the terrible, artillery of modern times, \\\"the wooden walls of old England\\\" are only, fit to be used as store-ships or hospitals for a few years, and then, sent to the ship-yards to be broken up for firewood.  But though, material conditions have changed, the moral forces are the same as ever\\n\\nJack, however, soon again took the file, and in a short time announced, that both the centre bars were cut through at the bottom.  They had next, to file the upper bars sufficiently to enable Brown to bend them back., Losing patience, however, he at last seized one of them, when, placing, his feet against the window, he bent back with all his strength.  He was, more successful than he expected, for the iron giving way, down he fell, on the floor with a tremendous crash, which would certainly have been, heard by the guards below, had not their attention been drawn off by the, fiddle of Le Duc, who was scraping away with more vehemence than ever., Rayner and Oliver had in the meantime been manufacturing the rope by, which they hoped to descend to the ground.  They could measure the, necessary length by the small line with which the files had been drawn, up, and they had the satisfaction of finding that it was amply long, enough for their purpose.  They now secured it to one of the remaining, bars.  Rayner and Oliver agreed that it would be wise to descend while, the fiddle was going.\\n\\nIt is too true a saying that \\\"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the, lip.\\\"  The _Ione_ was about midway between the Spanish coast and, Majorca, when, as morning broke, a number of ships were seen standing, out from the direction of Minorca.  At first it was supposed that they, were part of the English fleet, but after two of the lieutenants had, taken a careful survey of them from aloft, it was decided that they were, French.\\n\\nSoon after the _Lily_ left Jamaica she fell in with the _Ariel_.  As a, calm came on while they were in company, the officers of the two ships, paid visits to each other.  Rayner, recollecting that Mary Crofton's, brother Oliver was serving in her, got leave to go on board, for the, purpose of making his acquaintance.  He was much disappointed, on, inquiring for him, to learn that he had been sent away a few days, before, in charge of a prize, a brig called the _Clerie_, with orders to, take her to Jamaica.\\n\\nTom Fletcher, as soon as the ship got into harbour, managed to procure a, pen and some ink and paper, and indited a letter to his father.  It was, not over-well written, but he contrived to make it pretty clearly, express that he was serving on board H.M.S.  _Thisbe_, and that having, already seen a great deal of service, he felt sure that if his father, would apply to the Admiralty and make him an allowance of thirty or, forty pounds a year, he should be placed on the quarter-deck, and in due, course of time become an admiral.\\n\\nas the boat was overloaded, they were about to heave me overboard, when, I opened my eyes, and sang out, `Don't;' so they let me remain, and, after some time pulled alongside a cutter, on board which we were taken, and looked after below.  Shortly afterwards we went in chase of a French, craft of the same rig as ours, but she got away, and we then steered for, Plymouth.  We were at first taken on board the guardship, where we, remained some time, and then I was transferred with others to this, frigate, the _Thisbe_, of which, to my great satisfaction, I found that, Mr Saltwell had been appointed first lieutenant.  Thinking that, as we, had shared a common misfortune, he would stand my friend, I went up to, him, and telling him that I was a gentleman's son, begged he would have, me put on the quarter-deck.  He told me that if I did my duty I should, have as good a chance as others; but here I am set to scrape potatoes, and clean pots and pans.  It's a shame, a great shame, and I can't stand, it.\\\"\\n\\nThey found their way easily enough; but Jack, as before, did not feel, quite comfortable as he saw the strange figures, which seemed to be, flitting about the sides of the cavern; sometimes, too, he fancied that, he detected faces grinning down upon him from the roof, and more than, once he declared positively that he had caught sight of a figure robed, in white stealing along in front of them.\\n\\n\\\"I knew you would not desert us, Rayner,\\\" he said.  \\\"But now you have, come, how are we to get this poor fellow to the shore?  I could not, leave him, or I would not have allowed you to risk your life by, returning on board.  We must try and knock a raft together sufficient to, carry Peek, and you and I will swim alongside it, if we cannot make it, large enough to hold us all three.  There's no time to be lost, though.\\\"\\n\\nBill did not scold him, vexed as he felt at the delay which had, occurred.  They might still be in time to get on board the wreck and to, launch their raft, but it would be broad daylight before they could get, to any distance from the shore, and they would then be sure to be seen., Bill only hoped that no one would think it worth while to follow them.\\n\\n\\\"Although I saw several coveys of flying-fish leaping out of the water, in the distance, none came near us.  Once I caught sight of the black, fin of a shark gliding by; presently the creature turned, and as it, passed it eyed us, I thought, with an evil look; but while the water was, calm, there was no risk of its getting at us.  Had the brute been, smaller, we might have tried to catch it.  I remembered having heard of, several people who saved their lives, when nearly starved, by getting, hold of a shark.  One of the men stuck out his leg, and when the, creature tried to grab it, a running bowline was slipped round its head\\n\\nThe dawn now broke, and they eagerly looked out on every side for a, sail.  As the light increased they were greatly disappointed, on gazing, astern, to discover the French coast still in sight, though blue and, indistinct, like a cloud rising out of the water.  No sail, however, was, to be seen in that direction.  That was a comfort; they were not pursued, by any large craft, and could certainly not be seen from the shore.\\n\\nBill's voice greatly re-assured Jack, who, fancying that he saw one of, the ghosts he was afraid of, had fallen down in a sort of swoon.  How, long it would have lasted if Bill had not come to him it is impossible, to say; perhaps long enough to have allowed his candle to be, extinguished.  Had this happened, he would never have been able to find, his way out of the cavern.  He, however, with Bill by his side, soon, felt like himself again.\\n\\nthey were up to the rear of it before the garrison were aware of the, capture of the larger fort.  By a sudden dash it was taken as the former, had been, the _British_ not losing a single man, though several of its, defenders, attempting to stand their ground, were cut down.  A rocket, let off the moment they were in was the signal to the _Ariel_ to cease, firing.\\n\\nBill said he would consider the subject, and in the meantime they made a, further survey of their prison.  It could not be called luxuriantly, furnished, considering that there was only a bench of no great width, running along the side of one of the walls, and the remains of a table., One of the legs had gone, and part of the top, and it was propped up by, a couple of empty casks.\\n\\n\\\"If I go to Mr Saltwell, perhaps he will think I was dreaming, and tell, me to `turn into my hammock and finish my dreams,'\\\" he thought to, himself.  \\\"No!  I'll go to the captain at once; perhaps the sentry will, let me pass, or if not, I'll get him to ask the captain to see me.  He, cannot eat me, that's one comfort; if he thinks that I am bringing him a, cock-and-bull story, he won't punish me; and I shall at all events have, done my duty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you think it's made of?\\\" asked Bill.  \\\"Why, sheets and blankets, and ticking,\\\" replied Jack.  \\\"Yes,\\\" said Bill, \\\"you are right; and with, those selfsame sheets and blankets, and maybe a fathom or two of rope, besides, underneath, I intend that we shall try to lower ourselves down, to the ground; and when we are once outside, it will be our own fault if, we do not get back to the harbour, and when there, that we do not get on, board our raft again.  The French captain said it was to be left just as, it was for the general to see it to-morrow morning.  Before that time, comes, I hope that we shall be out of sight of land, if we get a fair, breeze, or, at all events, out of sight of the people on shore.\\\"\\n\\nwith the other tied up to deceive the people.  It's hard things I'm, saying, I know, but I cannot stand by and hear a fellow who ought to, know better running monstrous falsehoods off his reel as you have been, doing.  You might have borne up for Greenwich, and been looked after by, a grateful country; or you might have saved money enough to have kept, yourself in comfort to the end of your days; but it all went in drink, and debauchery, and now you abuse the government for not looking after, you.  Howsumdever, Tom Fletcher, I'm very sorry for you, and if you'll, knock off this sort of vagabond life, which brings disgrace on the name, of a British sailor, I'll answer for it our good captain will exert his, influence and get you a berth in Greenwich or elsewhere, for he has, often spoken about you, and wondered where you were a-serving.\\\"\\n\\nor a privateer.  If such were the case, and the _Thisbe_ could get up to, her, she would be captured to a certainty, though she would probably, fight, and try to knock away some of the _Thisbe's_ spars, so as to, effect her escape.  The wind, which had hitherto been blowing from the, southward and south, suddenly shifted to the east.  As soon as the, stranger felt it, she was seen to haul her tacks on board, brace up her, yards, and stand away towards the land.\\n\\nsturdy fellow, whose cutlass had already brought two of the English, seamen to the deck, suddenly attacked him, hoping to regain the ship., The sailors had enough to do to defend themselves, and the big boatswain, was making a desperate blow at the lieutenant's head, when Bill, who, thought it a time to use his pistol with effect, fired, and the, boatswain fell, his cutlass dropping from his hand.  His followers on, this sprang back, and, throwing down their weapons, cried for mercy.\\n\\nIt was making a dreadful uproar in the cavern, and he wanted to, ascertain what chance there was of the waves washing in.  There was not, much risk, to be sure, of their reaching as far as they then were, but, it was as well to be on the safe side, and if there was a likelihood of, it they would move farther up and carry their provisions and store of, fuel with them, the only property they possessed.\\n\\nAs their torches were by this time nearly burnt out, they could not, venture to stop and examine the goods, but had to hurry back as fast as, they could.  They had managed to get through the narrow passage, and had, made some progress in their return, when both of them were obliged to, let their torches drop, as they could no longer hold them without, burning their hands.  They might have lighted their candles, had they, been in any difficulty, but their fire enabled them to find their way, along, though they stumbled frequently over the inequalities of the, ground, and once or twice Jack clutched Bill's arm, exclaiming, \\\"Sure!, there's some one!  I saw him move!  Can any of the soldiers have come to, look for us?\\\"\\n\\nThis was just what her now thoroughly excited crew desired most, as they, could discharge their two broadsides at the same time; and right, gallantly did she fight her way through her numerous foes till she got, up with the American ship, which had been endeavouring to escape before, the wind, and now, to avoid the broadside which the English ship was, about to pour into her, she hauled down her colours.\\n\\nThe lieutenant, singing out for a rope, fastened it round him, though, feeling that he himself would be overpowered before the gallant seaman, could be drawn up.  He succeeded, however, and once more returned to the, deck above.  Still, he knew that a large quantity of powder remained, dry, and that should the fire reach the magazine, the destruction of all, on board would be inevitable.  Although gasping for breath, he was about, again to descend, when a light, active figure, with a rope round his, waist, darted passed him, and he recognised Rayner.  He was about to, follow, when he heard the voice of the midshipman shouting, \\\"Haul me up\\n\\nA bright look-out was kept from the mast-head from sunrise to sunset for, a strange sail, and it was not probable that they would have to go long, without falling in with one, for England had at that time pretty nearly, all the world in arms against her.  She had managed to quarrel with the, Dutch, and was at war with the French and Spaniards, while she had, lately been engaged in a vain attempt to overcome the American colonies\\n\\n\\\"That somebody will never come to claim it,\\\" answered Jack.  \\\"Depend on, it, he's gone to the bottom, or ended his days somehow long ago, or he, would have come back before this.  These goods have been here for, months, or years maybe, by the look of the packages; and depend on it, the owners would not have let them stay where they are, if they could, have come back to fetch them away.\\\"\\n\\npressed most of them, just come in from a long voyage, many months or, perhaps years having passed since they left their native land; that they, did not look especially amiable was not to be wondered at, since they, had been prevented from going, as they had intended, to visit their, friends, or maybe, in the case of the careless ones, from enjoying a, long-expected spree on shore.  They were all now waiting to be inspected, by the first lieutenant, before their names were entered on the ship's, books.\\n\\nAs the men-of-war approached, the merchant vessels, to the number of, nearly fifty, got under way and stood down Channel.  It was pretty hard, work to keep them together, and the corvette was employed in continually, firing signals to urge on the laggers, or to prevent the faster craft, from running out of sight.  What with shortening and making sail and, signalling, together with getting a newly commissioned ship into trim\\n\\nThe progress Jack and his companions made was very small, and it was, evident that unless they could work faster they would be unable to, remove the bar before daylight.  Rayner and Oliver searched round the, room for any pieces of iron which might serve the purpose of a chisel., They examined the bedsteads--they were formed entirely of wood.  There, was, of course, no fireplace, or a poker might have assisted them.  They, had just returned to the window when their ears caught the sounds of a, few low notes from a violin, played almost directly beneath them.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps the captain intends to make you his clerk, or maybe some day, you will become his coxswain,\\\" observed Jack, whose ambition soared no, higher.  \\\"I should like to be that, but I suppose that it is not, necessary to be able to read, or write, or sum.  I never could make any, hand at those things, but you seem up to them, and so it's all right, that you should learn.\\\"\\n\\nAgain left in darkness, they prepared to pass another disagreeable, night.  Rayner felt that their position was critical in the extreme.  He, and his companions, accused as they were of being spies, might be led, out at any moment and shot.  He therefore considered it his duty to, prepare his companions as best he could for the worst.  Oliver he knew, was as ready to die as he was himself.  He spoke earnestly and, faithfully to the others, pointing out the unspeakable importance of, being prepared to stand in the presence of the Judge of all men.  He was, thankful to hear Jack's reply, which expressed the simple hope of the, Christian--faith in Christ as a Saviour; but the other two were silent.\\n\\nThe letter, after being folded several times and creased all over, was, at length closed, sealed, and addressed, by which time it had assumed a, somewhat grimy appearance.  Tom got the cook's mate, who was going on, shore, to post his letter, having told him that he expected to receive a, good sum of money by return, and promising him a part of the proceeds., Bill and Jack looked forward to the reply with almost as much interest, as Tom himself, neither of them feeling that they should be at all, jealous, should it produce the satisfactory result he anticipated.\\n\\nRayner had made up his mind to go out and try to ascertain what had, become of him, or at all events to obtain some food, for he felt that, neither he nor the rest of the party could get through the night when, travelling without it.  Later on it would be still more difficult to, obtain, as the inhabitants would be in bed.  He thought he should be, able to find his way back to their place of concealment; so, desiring, the party to keep perfectly silent, he set out.  He had not gone far in, the wood, when he heard footsteps.  He crouched down behind a tree\\n\\nThe news quickly spread fore and aft that the _Lily_ was to be sent, home.  Loud cheers rose from many a stout throat, the invalids, of which, there were not a few, joining in the chorus from below.  One-third of, those who had come out had either fallen fighting in the many actions in, which she had been engaged, or, struck down by yellow fever, lay in the, graveyard of Port Royal.  No time was lost in getting fresh water and, provisions on board.\\n\\n\\\"The privateer continued her cruise in search of our merchantmen, or any, prizes our ships might have taken.  A more ruffianly set of fellows I, never set eyes on.  My poor men were robbed of everything they had about, them, and I should have had my jacket taken off my back but for the, interference of the officers, who allowed me to mess with them, and to, go on deck whenever I wished.  Considering the style of their, conversation at table, however, I should have thankfully preferred, living by myself.\\n\\nLike his illustrious French contemporary Jean Bart, John Benbow was of, humble origin.  He entered the merchant service when a boy.  He was, unknown till he had reached the age of thirty, when he had risen to the, command of a merchant vessel.  Attacked by a powerful Salee rover, he, gallantly repulsed these Moorish pirates, and took his ship safe into, Cadiz.  The heads of thirteen of the pirates he preserved, and delivered, them to the magistrates of the town, in presence of the custom-house, officers.  The tidings of this strange incident reached Madrid, and the, King of Spain, Charles the Second, sent for the English captain\\n\\nWhen Captain Martin came to muster the shipwrecked men saved by his, exertions, he found that upwards of three hundred of the crew of his, late antagonist had perished, seventy alone having landed in safety., Leaving a party on the beach to watch lest any more should be washed on, shore, he and the magistrate led the way up the cliff.  The Frenchmen, followed with downcast hearts, fully believing that they were to be, treated as prisoners of war.  Some of them, aided by the British seamen\\n\\nBill Rayner had certainly not been born with a silver spoon in his, mouth.  His father he had never known.  His mother lived in a garret and, died in a garret, although not before, happily for him, he was able to, do something for himself, and, still more happily, not before she had, impressed right principles on his mind.  As the poor woman lay on her, deathbed, taking her boy's hands and looking earnestly into his eyes\\n\\nAn hour and a half had passed since the French frigate had opened her, fire, and still the little sloop held out.  Commander Saltwell's great, object was to avoid being run down or boarded.  This he managed to do by, skilful manoeuvring.  At length Rayner, through his glass, observed the, crew of the frigate running about her deck as if in considerable, confusion.  Once more the _Lily_ fired, but what was the astonishment of, the British seamen to see her haul her main-tack aboard and begin to, make all sail, putting her head to the northward.  To follow was, impossible, as the _Lily_ had every brace and bowline, all her after, backstays, several of her lower shrouds, and other parts of her rigging\\n\\nbeen among them, were missing; and though the survivors mourned their, loss, that was not the time either to think or talk about them.  Not a, word, indeed, was spoken fore and aft; not even the usual jokes passed, between the men.  The Frenchman showed no inclination to avoid the, combat.  He could not have got away even had he wished, for his, foretopmast was gone, and he had not fully repaired the other damages he, had received aloft.\\n\\nThey, however, made the fullest examination in their power to ascertain, the best spot for their descent; they looked out of every window in, succession, but at last arrived at the conclusion that the attempt to, scramble down a perpendicular wall was too hazardous to be made.  They, now began to fear that their enterprise must be abandoned, and that they, should be compelled to make their way first to a lower storey, which\\n\\nBill, however, often thought over the matter, and tried to devise some, plan by which he and Jack might manage to get across.  His plans came to, nothing; and, indeed, the Channel where they were was much too wide to, be crossed except in a small vessel or in a large boat.  Jack was, beginning to speak French pretty well, and Bill was able to gabble away, with considerable fluency, greatly to the delight of Jeannette, who was, his usual instructress.  He tried to teach her a little English in, return, but she laughed at her own attempts, and declared that she, should never be able to pronounce so break-jaw a language.\\n\\n\\\"These I brought by the desire of Madame La Roche,\\\" he said.  \\\"She and, her daughters, and their black girls, and old Francois, worked away very, hard to get them finished.  They began the very moment you and the, gendarmes left the house.  It was Mademoiselle Sophie's idea, she's a, clever young lady.  Directly the dresses were completed, Francois and I, started off on horseback, as we knew the road you had taken, I dressed, as you see me, and carrying my fiddle in a bag hung round my neck.  I, was a strolling player once, and belonged to a circus before I became a, sailor, so I was at home on horseback, and I was at home also when, playing my tricks off on the gendarmes.  I have keen wits and strong, nerves, messieurs.  One without the other is of small value.  United\\n\\nThe question was, on which side should they attempt to make their, descent?  On looking through the narrow windows, they observed a gleam, of light coming out below them on one side; probably that was from the, guard-room, and they accordingly fixed on the opposite side, where all, was dark.  They ran no little chance of breaking their necks, but about, that they did not trouble themselves.  If a cat could get up, they, believed that they could get down, by clinging with toes and fingers\\n\\nAs they had found a fire very useful and pleasant, they went down as, close as they could venture to the water, and employed themselves in, collecting all the driftwood and chips they could find.  They agreed, that they would do the same every day, so as to have a good stock of, fuel.  They wanted also to secure some pieces which might serve as, torches, so that they could examine the smugglers' store as they called, it, which they had discovered.\\n\\nTom, as he had made his bed, had to lie on it, as is the case with many, other persons.  Even now, had he written home, he might have had his, position changed, but he thought himself very clever, and had no, intention of letting his father know where he had gone.  The last of the, trio was far more accustomed to salt water than was either of his, companions.  Jack Peek was the son of a West country fisherman.  He had, come to sea because he saw that there was little chance of getting bread, to put into his mouth if he remained on shore.\\n\\nBill, however, first went to the bed, examined the blankets and sheets, and mattress, and found, to his satisfaction, that below all were two, thick pieces of canvas, drawn together by a rope.  The rope, though, rather thin, would, he was satisfied, bear their light weights.  It, might take them half an hour or so to twist the various materials up, into a rope, and altogether would give them one of ample length for, their purpose.\\n\\nA bright look-out was kept for enemies; all hands, from the captain, downwards, being eager to secure another prize, even though they might, have to fight a tough battle to win her.  The captain's orders were to, capture, sink, burn, destroy, or drive on shore any of the enemy's, vessels he could come up with.  With this object in view the _Thisbe_, continued to cruise, now down the Channel, now up again, keeping as much, as possible in sight of the French coast.  She had been some time at, sea, however, without having made any prizes; for although she had, chased several vessels, they, having espied her in time, had managed to, escape by running close in shore, under strong batteries, or getting up, harbours where they could not be followed.  At last one morning, as the, frigate had just made the land, from which she had been standing off, during the night, a sail was seen inside of her--that is, between her, and the French coast, steering to the eastward, apparently bound down, Channel.\\n\\nOn reaching it, there was no appearance of fire or smoke.  It was thus, evident that the seat of the fire was farther forward.  He and his, companions next proceeded to the hold, but the dense smoke compelled, them to beat a retreat, as their throats became affected as if from the, fumes of hot tar.  A second attempt to reach the hold was equally, unsuccessful.  The entire absence of heat, however, convinced them that, the fire could not be in that part of the ship, but that the smoke found, its way through the bulkheads.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been nearly ten days ago when the _Ariel_, to which I, belonged, captured a French brig.  Captain Matson sent me on board to, take her to Port Royal.  We were just in sight of the eastern end of, Jamaica, when a large privateer bore down on us.  We did our best to, escape, but as she sailed two feet to our one, and carried twenty-two, guns, we were compelled to yield, and I and my men were taken on board\\n\\nThe frigate then again stood in, taking care to show no lights, when in, perfect silence the boats shoved off, carrying among them about fifty, officers and men.  Lieutenant Saltwell called Bill aft to take a seat by, his side.  Before leaving the frigate, the captain had directed the, first lieutenant to return should he find the ship so moored as to, render it impossible to bring her out.  Bill, however, told him that he, had observed a vessel at anchor some way below the landing-place, and, that he supposed no large craft could get up higher on account of the, shallowness of the water.  The wind, which had hitherto been east and, north-east, again shifting to the southward, blew directly down the, harbour, which would enable the ship, should she be captured, to be, brought down without difficulty.\\n\\nAfter a considerable time of intense anxiety it was found that the line, was taut.  Ben had, it was supposed, reached the forechains of the, frigate.  Then the question rose, whether he would be able to make, himself understood by the Frenchmen.  One of the men, however, who had, been washed on shore said that he believed one or two people on board, understood English; but it was doubtful whether they were among those, who had already perished.\\n\\nhad no intention of yielding his ship as long as he had a stick standing, to escape with.  Full of men as he now was, he hoped to beat off both, his foes, though he could not expect to capture them in sight of an, enemy's squadron.  As they got nearer, a couple of guns were trained aft, to serve as stern chasers, and every preparation was made to fight for, life and liberty.\\n\\ncould no longer support myself, and once more sank on the raft.  In a, short time, however, we could all distinguish her.  The Frenchmen began, to weep.  Now they expressed their fears that she would pass us; now, they tried to shout for joy at the thoughts of being saved.  I at times, also dreaded lest we should not be observed, but all my doubts vanished, when I made you out to be an English sloop-of-war, and saw you haul up, towards us.\\\"\\n\\nThe day passed, and no enemy appeared.  Next morning, however, a sail, was seen to the northward.  Captain Martin immediately bore up to, ascertain her character.  As the daylight increased, all felt confident, that she was a frigate, and probably French.  The stranger was seen to, be carrying a press of canvas, and apparently steering for Cherbourg., To re-enter that port she must encounter the _Thisbe_, on board which, preparations were made for the expected engagement.  The stranger, too\\n\\n\\\"Come, Jack, stow this away in your inside as fast as you can, that you, may have strength to go on as soon as it is time to start.  We don't, intend to spend our lives here, like mice in a hole.\\\"  Jack did as he, was bid, without asking questions.  Just as he had finished, Tom groaned, out, \\\"I shall die soon if I don't get something to eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was pretty well tired by this time, and had to rest two or three, minutes before I could again venture into the water.  While I was trying, to recover my strength, the man clinging to the log, fancying that no, one was coming, again shrieked out for help.  Once more slipping into, the water, at last by shoving the piece of plank before me, I contrived, to reach him; then getting him to take hold of it, I made my way back to, the raft, when we were both dragged nearly exhausted out of the water.\\n\\nBill now went to the window, and found that the grass came close up to, the walls of the tower underneath.  Even should they fall from a, considerable height, they might have the chance of not breaking their, bones, and that was some satisfaction.  An iron bar extended from the, top of the window to the bottom in the centre.  He felt it, and it was, strong as need be.  It would do well for securing their rope.  As far as, he could judge, there was no window under them.  This was of, consequence, as had there been, they might have been seen by any person, within during their descent, rapidly as they might make it.  Bill, considered whether it would be possible to withdraw the rope after they, had descended, but he doubted whether they had sufficient materials to, enable them to do that.\\n\\nWith the exception of Le Duc they were all soon collected in the room, below.  He had managed by some means to escape detection.  They were, allowed but a short time to take leave of Madame La Roche and her, daughters.  The sergeant having received no orders respecting the, ladies, and satisfied at having secured his prisoners, seemed disposed, to allow the former to remain unmolested.  They looked very melancholy\\n\\n\\\"Don't think about it,\\\" said Bill; \\\"you are safe from further harm, and, will be well taken care of; and when you have recovered, and the war is, over, you will be able to go back.  I must leave you now, but I will, come and see you as often as I can.  I have placed the jug of lemonade, close to your head, where it cannot slip.  When that is gone I will get, some more; it is the best thing you can take at present.\\\"\\n\\nhowever, was covered with several dishes, which, from the fragrant odour, ascending from them, promised to satisfy the hunger of a couple of, midshipmen.  It was difficult to make out the materials of which the, dishes were composed, but on examination it was found that they, consisted chiefly of salt beef and fish dressed in a variety of, fashions, fricasseed, stewed, and grilled, and mixed with an abundance, of vegetables, with some delicious fruit, such as the West Indies can, alone produce.\\n\\nThey forgot all about the smugglers' stores, and their intention of, making clothes for themselves; indeed, they only thought of getting on, board the vessel.  They watched eagerly for the tide to go down.  The, day passed by and the night came on, but the clouds clearing away, a, bright moon shed her light over the scene.  The wind had also sensibly, decreased, and the waves rolled in with far less fury than before.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see that we have not still a chance of coming up with her,\\\", answered Bill.  \\\"The captain thinks so, or he would not be keeping after, her.  Perhaps she may be becalmed closer in with the land, or we may, draw near enough to knock away her masts.  We have gained a mile on her, during the last hour.  I would always try to succeed while a single, chance remains, and I would never knock under to an enemy while I had a, stick standing, or a plank beneath my feet.\\\"\\n\\nhowever, terror-stricken, and thinking only of their own safety, rushed, up the beach, as if fancying that the sea might still overtake them., Tom and his messmate alone remained, and held on to the rope.  Rayner, swam off towards the Frenchman, who was nearest to the shore.  Grasping, him by the shirt, he ordered Tom and Brown to haul him in, and in a few, seconds they succeeded in getting the Frenchman on shore.\\n\\nBill was glad to find that he had not to go back to his own ship, as he, wanted to look after Pierre, and as soon as his duty would allow him he, went below to learn how his young French friend was getting on.  When he, asked for the man whom he had brought down, the doctor pointed to one of, the officer's cabins in the gun-room, observing, \\\"He is somewhat badly, hurt, but there are others still more cruelly knocked about who require, my care, and I have not been able to attend to him for some time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir, I'm sorry to say I have,\\\" answered Jack.  \\\"He has been, knocking about Plymouth, hiding away from the press-gangs in all sorts, of places, instead of going home to his father, as he said he would.  I, only found him last night, and tried to persuade him to join the _Lily_, with me, but he'd still a shiner or two in his locker, and he couldn't, make up his mind to come till the last had gone.  I know where to find, him, and I'll try again after I have entered on board the _Lily_.\\\"\\n\\nAt last they begged leave to go down to see their men.  They were guided, to their rooms by sounds of music and uproarious laughter.  They found, Le Duc seated on a three-legged stool on the top of a table fiddling, away, while old Francois, three black women, Tom and Brown, were dancing, in the strangest possible fashion, whirling round and round, kicking up, their heels, and joining hands, while Jack lay on a bed at the farther, end of the room, looking as if he longed to get up and take a part in, the dance.\\n\\nRayner for some time walked the deck of the little vessel alone.  Jack, was at the helm, and one of the men forward.  The watch was very nearly, out, and he determined not to call up Oliver until daylight.  On looking, to the southward he saw that the mist which had before remained only a, few feet above the horizon was rapidly covering the sky, while beneath, it he distinguished a long line of white foam.\\n\\nIf Tom had any fear, it was not the time to show it.  He heard all, around him speak of fighting as if it were fun, and of death with, seeming levity.  It is the way of the young and the thoughtless.  Old, sailors and old soldiers seldom talk thus, and think more of duty than, of glory.  For young or for old the loss of life is not a matter for, light talk, as if death were only the end of it.  Those that cause war, will have much to reckon for hereafter.  But there is no time for such, thoughts in sight of the enemy.  So we must go on with our story.\\n\\nAt length the entrance to Plymouth Sound was descried, and the _Thisbe_, and her prize stood up it triumphantly with colours flying, creating, considerable astonishment at her quick return with another capture., Both were soon moored in Hamoaze, when the _Atlante_, a fine little, ship, carrying twenty guns on one deck, was handed over to the prize, agents with the full expectation that she would be bought into the, service.  The prisoners were carried on shore, the wounded men were, taken to the hospital, and the prize crew returned on board their own, ship.\\n\\nThe breeze freshened, and the prize in a short time reached the mouth of, the harbour.  No sooner had she done so than the guns from the fort, as, had been expected, opened fire, and their shot, thick as hail, came, crashing on board.  Several men were struck, and the sails shot through, and through.  None of the yards, however, were carried away, and the, canvas stood filled out with the breeze.\\n\\n\\\"Try to keep ahead of her,\\\" answered Bill, glancing round for a moment., \\\"The Frenchmen may not think it worth while to chase us far, even if, they are in chase of us, and that's not certain.  Don't let us cry out, before we are hurt.  Get out the oars, they'll help us on a little, and, we'll do our best to escape.  I don't fancy being shut up again, or, perhaps being carried off to a prison, and forced into a dungeon, or, maybe shot, for they'll declare that we are escaped prisoners.\\\"\\n\\nBill at once put his resolution into practice.  He did not mind wetting, his feet; but he had here and there a hard job to save himself from, being carried off by the sea, which rolled up the beach to the very foot, of the cliff.  Twice he had to cling to a rock, and frequently to wade, for some distance, till he began to regret that he had ventured so soon;, but having made up his mind to do a thing, he was not to be defeated by, the fear of danger; so waiting till the wave had receded, he rushed on, to another rock.  The sky had become overcast.  The leaden seas\\n\\njust as a dog does when a person attempts to take a bone from him.  He, had managed to gulp down the larger portion before the others could, snatch the prize from him.  The next moment he sank back, and never, spoke again.  I saw no violence used, except the force they exerted to, take the fragments of the fish from his hands.  It appeared to me as if, one of them had stabbed him, so suddenly did he fall.\\n\\n\\\"Why, if they leave us here long enough, the next thing that will happen, will be that we'll make our way out again,\\\" replied Bill.  \\\"Look at, those windows!  Though they are not very big, they are large enough for, us to squeeze through, or it may be more convenient to make our way out, by the roof.  I can see daylight through one or two places, which shows, that the tiles are not very securely fastened on.\\\"\\n\\nAs they went along, Le Duc said, \\\"When I got near the village I met an, old black, who told me there were no strangers in the place, and that I, might easily procure what I wanted.  I accordingly went on boldly, until, I reached a cottage just in the outskirts.  I entered and found the, people ready enough to sell me some bread and sausages, charging me, three times as much as they were worth.  I also procured this straw bag, to put them in.  While I was there packing them up several persons who, had come in were talking, and I heard them say that a party of soldiers, had just arrived, on their way from Leogane to Port Saint Louis in the, bay, and that they were ordered to look out for several English spies\\n\\n\\\"I don't quite like the look of the weather,\\\" observed Bill one day to, Jack, just before the time Jeannette was due at the little cave, and all, their provisions were expended.  \\\"If it comes on very bad she may be, stopped, and we shall be pressed.  I'll slip down the moment the water, is shallow enough, and try to get along the shore; and if she has not, reached the cave, I'll go on and meet her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have an idea,\\\" cried Bill.  \\\"It's an ill wind that brings no one good, luck.  If we can manage to get on board that craft which has come on, shore, we might build a boat out of her planking, or at all events a, raft; and should the wind come from the southward, we might manage to, get across the Channel, or be picked up by some vessel or other.  We are, pretty sure to find provisions on board.  Perhaps one of her boats may, have escaped being knocked to pieces, and we could repair her.  At all, events, it will be our own fault if that wreck doesn't give us the, opportunity of escaping.\\\"\\n\\nregardless of that of their late shipmates, hurried into eternity.  In, vain I tried to arouse them.  Now and then one would look at me with an, ominous glance, and I confess I began to fear, as night drew on, that I, should not be allowed to see another day dawn.  I stood up, though it, was with difficulty that I could steady myself, for my strength was, already failing.  Anxiously I looked round the horizon.  The sky had, hitherto been clear; but, as I cast my eye to the eastward, I observed a, cloud rising rapidly.  Another and another followed.  They came on, directly towards us, discharging heavy drops of rain.  My fear was that, they would empty themselves before they reached us.  The looks of my, companions brightened.\\n\\nlocking the cottage door after him, and hung the key on a hook in a tree, in the garden.  Many years passed before he returned to the old place., Though now out of his reach, for the tree had grown faster than he, the, key still hung on the hook.  He left it there; and there it remained, when he came back as Rear-Admiral of the _White_.  He then pointed it, out to his friends, and told the story.  Once more his country required, his services, but his fame and the echo of his victories alone came over, the wave.  The good town of Shrewsbury is proud to claim him as a son\\n\\nThey now proceeded towards the house, led by Le Duc.  The two officers, going first, they mounted the steps, and getting inside the house, they, saw an old mulatto carrying a couple of wax candles.  He beckoned them, with his head to follow, and led the way to an inner room, when an old, lady advanced to meet them.  Behind her came two young ladies, whom the, midshipmen thought very handsome, with dark flashing eyes and black, tresses, their costumes being light and elegant, and suited to that warm, clime.  The old lady introduced them as her daughters, Sophie and, Virginie.  The midshipmen advanced bowing, and Rayner, who was, spokesman, apologised for appearing in their wet and somewhat torn, clothes.\\n\\n\\\"Don't talk of that, my lad; if it hadn't been for your courage and, coolness I should not have been here.  I am now going on shore, and wish, you to accompany me.  I have seen the widow of an old shipmate of mine, who is willing to receive Pierre into her house, and to attend to him., We will have him removed at once, so that when we sail you will know he, is placed under good care.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I cannot agree with you as to the chance of getting off,\\\" he observed., \\\"As soon as the wreck is seen, the Frenchmen are sure to be down on the, shore, and we shall be caught and carried back to prison instead of, getting away.  The boats are pretty certain to have been knocked into, shreds before this, and as to building a boat, that is what neither you, nor I can do, even if we had the tools, and where are they to come, from?\\\"\\n\\nThis book was written for \\\"Boy's Own Paper\\\" shortly after that magazine, started.  The plan was to write a book illustrating how it might be, possible for any very ordinary little boy joining the Navy in the lowest, rating--powder monkey--and ascend to the very highest rank--admiral.  It, had been done before, in the separate cases of Benbow and Hopson, and, there was no reason why it shouldn't happen again.  A powder monkey was, so called because his job in manning the guns was to run from time to, time to fetch more powder whenever it was needed.  Since the boys were, small they afforded little target for the enemy's shot, so they tended, to survive an engagement.  Just as well, for their job was, indispensable.\\n\\nJack was still asleep.  He was breathing easily, and appeared to be, better; but still it was not probable that he would be able to continue, the journey.  It would be necessary, therefore, at all events, to remain, in the cavern all the day, but should he be well enough they might, continue their journey at nightfall.  Their chief difficulty would be to, procure food from the neighbouring village without exciting suspicion.\\n\\nMeantime, every possible exertion was made to get the ship ready for, sea.  Mr Saltwell was very busy superintending all the operations., Bill, however, found that he was not forgotten, from a kind word or two, which on several occasions the first lieutenant bestowed upon him.  As, Tom was not aware of this, he amused himself by telling Bill that Mr, Saltwell would not trouble himself more about him--that he must be, content to remain a powder monkey until he got big enough to be rated as, an ordinary seaman.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ay, sir,\\\" answered Rayner, very well pleased to have a separate, command, although it might only last a few hours.  He was still more, pleased, however, when the boat came back, bringing Oliver Crofton, the, four Frenchmen, and Jack and Tom, to form part of his crew.  The blacks, and the mulatto were kept on board to assist in working the schooner., The mulatto said he was the steward, and one of the blacks, with a low, bow, introduced himself as the cook.\\n\\nThe cargo had, however, to be got on board, consisting of the three, chests, which, of course, would bring it down somewhat.  They lowered, one after the other, and lashed them in the positions they had intended., The foremost chest was secured over all by ropes, as that had not to be, opened, and was to serve only as a step for their mast; the other two, chests were secured by their handles both fore and aft and athwartships\\n\\nRayner, having now committed himself to the care of Heaven, prepared to, swim off to the wreck.  He knew that Oliver would see him coming, and, would be ready to help him get on board.  Waiting until a sea had broken, on the beach, he followed it out, and darting through the next which, rolled forward, he was soon a long way from the shore.  He found he, could swim much better than before, now that he had no rope to carry., Boldly he struck forward.  Happily he did not recollect that those seas, swarmed with sharks.  On and on he went.  Now and again, as a sea rushed, over the reef, he was thrown back, but exerting all his strength, he, struggled forward.  He was nearing the wreck, and could see that Oliver\\n\\n\\\"There's no use talking about that.  We must run the risk,\\\" observed, Bill; \\\"so here goes.\\\"  And he forthwith turned back the coverlid, and, began measuring the sheets.  They were of strong and tough material, and, by dividing each into four lengths, he calculated that a rope formed of, them would be of sufficient strength for their purpose, and they were, quickly cut through with their knives, and each length was then twisted, tightly up.\\n\\nThe _Foxhound_ had for some days been cruising in the Bay of Biscay, and, was one morning about the latitude of Ferrol.  The watch was employed in, washing down decks, the men and boys paddling about with their trousers, tucked up to their knees, some with buckets of water, which they were, heaving about in every direction, now and then giving a shipmate, when, the first lieutenant's eye was off them, the benefit of a shower-bath:, others were wielding huge swabs, slashing them down right and left, with, loud thuds, and ill would it have fared with any incautious landsman who, might have got within their reach.  The men were laughing and joking, with each other, and the occupation seemed to afford amusement to all, employed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Breakfast was laid, for him in the coffee-room, and his brow darkened.  He walked into the, hall, and after trying various doors entered a small sitting-room, where, his host and daughter sat at breakfast, and with an easy assurance drew a, chair to the table.  The innkeeper helped him without a word, but the, girl's hand shook under his gaze as she passed him some coffee.\\n\\nThe arrogance of Gunn knew no bounds.  The maids learned to tremble at, his polite grin, or his worse freedom, and the men shrank appalled from, his profane wrath.  George, after ten years' service, was brutally, dismissed, and refusing to accept dismissal from his hands, appealed to, his master.  The innkeeper confirmed it, and with lack-lustre eyes fenced, feebly when his daughter, regardless of Gunn's presence, indignantly, appealed to him.\\n\\nAfter the first rally the innkeeper began to fail slowly.  It was seldom, that he understood what was said to him, and pitiful to the beholder to, see in his intervals of consciousness his timid anxiety to earn the good-, will of the all-powerful Gunn.  His strength declined until assistance, was needed to turn him in the bed, and his great sinewy hands were, forever trembling and fidgeting on the coverlet.\\n\\nThe surgeon was a man of few words and fewer attainments, but under his, ministrations the innkeeper, after a long interval, rallied.  The half-, closed eyes opened, and he looked in a dazed fashion at his surroundings., Gunn drove the servants away and questioned the man of medicine.  The, answers were vague and interspersed with Latin.  Freedom from noise and, troubles of all kinds was insisted upon and Joan was installed as nurse\\n\\nAffairs at the \\\"Golden Key\\\" grew steadily worse and worse.  Gunn, dominated the place, and his vile personality hung over it like a shadow., Appeals to the innkeeper were in vain; his health was breaking fast, and, he moodily declined to interfere.  Gunn appointed servants of his own, choosing-brazen maids and foul-mouthed men.  The old patrons ceased to, frequent the \\\"Golden Key,\\\" and its bedrooms stood empty.  The maids, scarcely deigned to take an order from Joan, and the men spoke to her, familiarly.  In the midst of all this the innkeeper, who had complained, once or twice of vertigo, was seized with a fit.\\n\\nHe averted his face, and for a time gazed sternly and watchfully at the, door.  Then he rose slowly to his feet, and taking the dead man in his, arms, bore him slowly and carefully to his room, and laid him a huddled, heap on the floor.  Swiftly and noiselessly he put the dead man's shoes, on and turned his pockets inside out, kicked a rug out of place, and put, a guinea on the floor.  Then he stole cautiously down stairs and set a, small door at the back open.  A dog barked frantically, and he hurried, back to his room.  The nurse still slumbered by the fire.\\n\\nThe door closed silently, and was opened a little later by the dubious, George coming in to set a bountiful repast.  Gunn, after cursing him for, his slowness and awkwardness, drew his chair to the table and made the, meal of one seldom able to satisfy his hunger.  He finished at last, and, after sitting for some time smoking, with his legs sprawled on the, fender, rang for a candle and demanded to be shown to his room.\\n\\n, A man came slowly over the old stone bridge, and averting his gaze from, the dark river with its silent craft, looked with some satisfaction, toward the feeble lights of the small town on the other side.  He walked, with the painful, forced step of one who has already trudged far.  His, worsted hose, where they were not darned, were in holes, and his coat and, knee-breeches were rusty with much wear, but he straightened himself as, he reached the end of the bridge and stepped out bravely to the taverns, which stood in a row facing the quay.\",\n          \"After running a long way, and as the last of the light was, disappearing, she passed under a tree with drooping branches. It, dropped its branches to the ground all about her, and caught her as in, a trap. She struggled to get out, but the branches pressed her closer, and closer to the trunk. She was in great terror and distress, when the, air-fish, swimming into the thicket of branches, began tearing them, with its beak. They loosened their hold at once, and the creature went, on attacking them, till at length they let the child go. Then the, air-fish came from behind her, and swam on in front, glittering and, sparkling all lovely colours; and she followed.\\n\\n\\\"Am I?\\\" she returned. \\\"Oh, I have waited for you so long! But you, you, are like the Old Man of the Sea. No. You are like the Old Man of the, Earth. No, no. You are like the oldest man of all. You are like them, all. And yet you are my own old Mossy! How did you come here? What did, you do after I lost you? Did you find the key-hole? Have you got the, key still?\\\"\\n\\nand looking everywhere for the thimble. Tricksey-Wee immediately laid, hold of it in both her arms, and lifted it about an inch nearer to the, nose of the peering giantess. This movement made the old lady see where, it was, and, her finger popping into it, it vanished from the eyes of, Tricksey-Wee, buried in the folds of a white stocking like a cloud in, the sky, which Mrs. Giant was busy darning. For it was Saturday night\\n\\nHe disguised himself, and, going to the palace, requested to see the, lord chamberlain. His appearance at once gained his request; and the, lord chamberlain, being a man of some insight, perceived that there was, more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear. He felt likewise, that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties, might arise. So he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoe-black to, the princess. It was rather cunning in the prince to request such an, easy post, for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as, other princesses. He soon learned all that could be learned about the, princess. He went nearly distracted; but after roaming about the lake, for days, and diving in every depth that remained, all that he could do, was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never, called for.\\n\\nNo one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before.--When, the prince saw her ascend, he thought he must have been bewitched, and, have mistaken a great swan for a lady. But the princess caught hold of, the topmost cone upon a lofty fir. This came off; but she caught at, another, and, in fact, stopped herself by gathering cones, dropping, them as the stocks gave way. The prince, meantime, stood in the water\\n\\n\\\"I know what you mean,\\\" returned the lady. \\\"You do not like to eat the, messenger that brought you home. But it is the kindest return you can, make. The creature was afraid to go until it saw me put the pot on, and, heard me promise it should be boiled the moment it returned with you., Then it darted out of the door at once. You saw it go into the pot of, itself the moment it entered, did you not?\\\"\\n\\nThe prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very, like other people. And besides this, she was not so forward in her, questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore. Neither did she, laugh so much; and when she did laugh, it was more gently. She seemed, altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it. But, when the prince, who had really fallen in love when he fell in the, lake, began to talk to her about love, she always turned her head, towards him and laughed. After a while she began to look puzzled, as if, she were trying to understand what he meant, but could not--revealing a, notion that he meant something. But as soon as ever she left the lake\\n\\nconsisting in part of a troop of light horse, for fear of the liberties, which the wind might take with her. And the king grew more apprehensive, with increasing years, till at last he would not allow her to walk, abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many, parts of her dress, and held by twenty noblemen. Of course horseback, was out of the question. But she bade good-bye to all this ceremony, when she got into the water.\\n\\nsinking as it sank, withering as it dried. When at length he discovered, the change that was taking place in the level of the water, he was in, great alarm and perplexity. He could not tell whether the lake was, dying because the lady had forsaken it; or whether the lady would not, come because the lake had begun to sink. But he resolved to know so, much at least.\\n\\nHere they sat down to consider what could be done. The spiders did not, heed them, but ate away at the flies.--Now, at the foot of the, mountain, and all round it, was a ring of water, not very broad, but, very deep. As they sat watching them, one of the spiders, whose web was, woven across this water, somehow or other lost his hold, and fell in on, his back. Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob ran to his assistance, and laying, hold each of one of his legs, succeeded, with the help of the other, legs, which struggled spiderfully, in getting him out upon dry land. As, soon as he had shaken himself, and dried himself a little, the spider, turned to the children, saying,--\\n\\nThe next moment she descried, in a corner of the cave, a little naked, child sitting on the moss. He was playing with balls of various colours, and sizes, which he disposed in strange figures upon the floor beside, him. And now Tangle felt that there was something in her knowledge, which was not in her understanding. For she knew there must be an, infinite meaning in the change and sequence and individual forms of the, figures into which the child arranged the balls, as well as in the, varied harmonies of their colours, but what it all meant she could not, tell.* He went on busily, tirelessly, playing his solitary game\\n\\nAfter a while, however, the cave began to glimmer again. The light came, from the moon, but it did not look like moonlight, for it gleamed, through those seven pillars in the middle, and filled the place with, all colours. And now Mossy saw that there was a pillar beside the red, one, which he had not observed before. And it was of the same new, colour that he had seen in the rainbow when he saw it first in the, fairy forest. And on it he saw a sparkle of blue. It was the sapphires, round the key-hole.\\n\\nOne day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest. These forests, are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers, like a, sieve that keeps back the bran. Then the princes get away to follow, their fortunes. In this they have the advantage of the princesses, who, are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun. I wish our, princesses got lost in a forest sometimes.\\n\\nThe giant caught up the broom, and seeing nothing under it, set it down, again with a force that threw them both on the floor. He then made two, strides to the boys, caught the dough-faced one by the neck, took the, lid off a great pot that was boiling on the fire, popped him in as if, he had been a trussed chicken, put the lid on again, and saying\\n\\nHe tried the key. It fitted. It turned. A great clang and clash, as of, iron bolts on huge brazen caldrons, echoed thunderously within. He drew, out the key. The rock in front of him began to fall. He retreated from, it as far as the breadth of the platform would allow. A great slab fell, at his feet. In front was still the solid rock, with this one slab, fallen forward out of it. But the moment he stepped upon it, a second, fell, just short of the edge of the first, making the next step of a, stair, which thus kept dropping itself before him as he ascended into, the heart of the precipice. It led him into a hall fit for such an, approach--irregular and rude in formation, but floor, sides, pillars\\n\\nNo sooner was she undressed and lying in the bath, than she began to, feel as if the water were sinking into her, and she were receiving all, the good of sleep without undergoing its forgetfulness. She felt the, good coming all the time. And she grew happier and more hopeful than, she had been since she lost Mossy. But she could not help thinking how, very sad it was for a poor old man to live there all alone, and have to, take care of a whole seaful of stupid and riotous fishes.\\n\\nhave an exceeding dislike to untidiness. Indeed, they are quite, spiteful to slovenly people. Being used to all the lovely ways of the, trees and flowers, and to the neatness of the birds and all woodland, creatures, it makes them feel miserable, even in their deep woods and, on their grassy carpets, to think that within the same moonlight lies a, dirty, uncomfortable, slovenly house. And this makes them angry with, the people that live in it, and they would gladly drive them out of the, world if they could. They want the whole earth nice and clean. So they, pinch the maids black and blue, and play them all manner of, uncomfortable tricks.\\n\\nThe king ordered out his guards, and gave directions to the officers to, find the hole in the lake at once. So the bed of the lake was marked, out in divisions and thoroughly examined, and in an hour or so the hole, was discovered. It was in the middle of a stone, near the centre of the, lake, in the very pool where the golden plate had been found. It was a, three-cornered hole of no great size. There was water all round the, stone, but very little was flowing through the hole.\\n\\nBut the princess did not heed the lake. She lay on the floor and wept., And this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of, doors. For when it abated a little, and she proceeded to rise, she, found, to her astonishment, that she could not. At length, after many, efforts, she succeeded in getting upon her feet. But she tumbled down, again directly. Hearing her fall, her old nurse uttered a yell of, delight, and ran to her, screaming,--\\n\\nsent some straggling trees into it. The forest lay to the east, and the, sun, which was setting behind the cottage, looked straight into the, dark wood with his level red eye. The trees were all old, and had few, branches below, so that the sun could see a great way into the forest;, and the boy, being keen-sighted, could see almost as far as the sun., The trunks stood like rows of red columns in the shine of the red sun\\n\\nSo he went the next morning to the house of the princess, and, making a, very humble apology, begged her to undo the spell. But the princess, declared, with a grave face, that she knew nothing at all about it. Her, eyes, however, shone pink, which was a sign that she was happy. She, advised the king and queen to have patience, and to mend their ways., The king returned disconsolate. The queen tried to comfort him.\\n\\nsoothingly. \\\"The great she-eagle has got it for a nest egg. She sits on, it night and day, and thinks she will bring the greatest eagle out of, it that ever sharpened his beak on the rocks of Mount Skycrack. I can, warrant no one else will touch it while she has got it. But she is, rather capricious, and I confess I am not easy about it; for the least, scratch of one of her claws would do for me at once. And she, _has_ claws.\\\"\\n\\nShe let it go, left it hanging, and sat down on a great stone, with her, black cat, which had followed her all round the cave, by her side. Then, she began to knit and mutter awful words. The snake hung like a huge, leech, sucking at the stone; the cat stood with his back arched, and, his tail like a piece of cable, looking up at the snake; and the old, woman sat and knitted and muttered. Seven days and seven nights they, remained thus; when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if, exhausted, and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried, seaweed. The witch started to her feet, picked it up, put it in her, pocket, and looked up at the roof. One drop of water was trembling on, the spot where the snake had been sucking. As soon as she saw that, she, turned and fled, followed by her cat. Shutting the door in a terrible, hurry, she locked it, and having muttered some frightful words, sped to, the next, which also she locked and muttered over; and so with all the, hundred doors, till she arrived in her own cellar. There she sat down, on the floor ready to faint, but listening with malicious delight to, the rushing of the water, which she could hear distinctly through all, the hundred doors.\\n\\nThe consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting, for, the thousandth time, each his favourite theories. For the condition of, the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every, question arising from the division of thought--in fact, of all the, Metaphysics of the Chinese Empire. But it is only justice to say that, they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical, question, _what was to be done_.\\n\\nI may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run, if her mode, of progression could properly be called running. For first she would, make a bound; then, having alighted, she would run a few steps, and, make another bound. Sometimes she would fancy she had reached the, ground before she actually had, and her feet would go backwards and, forwards, running upon nothing at all, like those of a chicken on its, back. Then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun; only in her, laugh there was something missing. What it was, I find myself unable to, describe. I think it was a certain tone, depending upon the possibility, of sorrow--_morbidezza_, perhaps. She never smiled.\\n\\n, One fine summer day, a month after these her first adventures, during, which time she had been very carefully watched, the princess was lying, on the bed in the queen's own chamber, fast asleep. One of the windows, was open, for it was noon, and the day so sultry that the little girl, was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself. The queen, came into the room, and not observing that the baby was on the bed\\n\\nThe children rose at once, and climbing as well as they could, reached, the spider's nest in the centre of the web. Nor did they find it very, difficult; for whenever too great a gap came, the spider spinning a, strong cord stretched it just where they would have chosen to put their, feet next. He left them in his nest, after bringing them two enormous, honey-bags, taken from bees that he had caught; but presently about six, of the wisest of the spiders came back with him. It was rather horrible, to look up and see them all round the mouth of the nest, looking down, on them in contemplation, as if wondering whether they would be nice, eating. At length one of them said,--\\\"Tell us truly what you want with, the eagle, and we will try to help you.\\\"\\n\\nThey all thought she had lost her wits, and was repeating some foolish, nursery rhyme; but a shudder went through the whole of them, notwithstanding. The baby, on the contrary, began to laugh and crow;, while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry, for she thought she, was struck with paralysis: she could not feel the baby in her arms. But, she clasped it tight and said nothing.\\n\\nWhen she came to herself, she found herself gliding down fast and deep., Her head was under water, but that did not signify, for, when she, thought about it, she could not remember that she had breathed once, since her bath in the cave of the Old Man of the Sea. When she lifted, up her head a sudden and fierce heat struck her, and she sank it again, instantly, and went sweeping on.\\n\\nher custom was to catch up a stone in each hand, so that she might come, down again after a bound. Whatever she wore as part of her attire had, no effect in this way: even gold, when it thus became as it were a part, of herself, lost all its weight for the time. But whatever she only, held in her hands retained its downward tendency. On this occasion she, could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad, that was walking across, the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in. Not knowing what, disgust meant, for this was one of her peculiarities, she snatched up, the toad and bounded away. She had almost reached her father, and he, was holding out his arms to receive her, and take from her lips the, kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud, when a puff, of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page, who had just been, receiving a message from his Majesty. Now it was no great peculiarity, in the princess that, once she was set agoing, it always cost her time, and trouble to check herself. On this occasion there was no time. She, _must_ kiss--and she kissed the page. She did not mind it much; for she, had no shyness in her composition; and she knew, besides, that she, could not help it. So she only laughed, like a musical box. The poor, page fared the worst. For the princess, trying to correct the, unfortunate tendency of the kiss, put out her hands to keep her off the, page; so that, along with the kiss, he received, on the other cheek, a, slap with the huge black toad, which she poked right into his eye. He, tried to laugh, too, but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion, of countenance, as showed that there was no danger of his pluming, himself on the kiss. As for the king, his dignity was greatly hurt, and, he did not speak to the page for a whole month.\\n\\nBut at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual. Perhaps that, was because a great pleasure spoils laughing. At all events, after, this, the passion of her life was to get into the water, and she was, always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of, it. Summer and winter it was quite the same; only she could not stay so, long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in. Any, day, from morning till evening in summer, she might be descried--a, streak of white in the blue water--lying as still as the shadow of a, cloud, or shooting along like a dolphin; disappearing, and coming up, again far off, just where one did not expect her. She would have been, in the lake of a night, too, if she could have had her way; for the, balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it; and through a shallow, reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water, and no, one would have been any the wiser. Indeed, when she happened to wake in, the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation. But there was the, sad difficulty of getting into it. She had as great a dread of the air, as some children have of the water. For the slightest gust of wind, would blow her away; and a gust might arise in the stillest moment. And, if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of, reaching it, her situation would be dreadfully awkward, irrespective of, the wind; for at best there she would have to remain, suspended in her, night-gown, till she was seen and angled for by someone from the, window.\\n\\nShe then untwined the snake from her body, and held it by the tail high, above her. The hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof, of the cavern, which it was just able to reach. It then began to move, its head backwards and forwards, with a slow oscillating motion, as if, looking for something. At the same moment the witch began to walk round, and round the cavern, coming nearer to the centre every circuit; while, the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she, did over the floor, for she kept holding it up. And still it kept, slowly oscillating. Round and round the cavern they went, ever, lessening the circuit, till at last the snake made a sudden dart, and, clung to the roof with its mouth.\\n\\nSuddenly, far among the trees, as far as the sun could shine, he saw a, glorious thing. It was the end of a rainbow, large and brilliant. He, could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade, beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous, and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before. Only, the spring of the rainbow-arch was visible. He could see nothing of it, above the trees.\\n\\nIt led her gently along till all at once it swam in at a cottage-door., The child followed still. There was a bright fire in the middle of the, floor, upon which stood a pot without a lid, full of water that boiled, and bubbled furiously. The air-fish swam straight to the pot and into, the boiling water, where it lay quiet. A beautiful woman rose from the, opposite side of the fire and came to meet the girl. She took her up in, her arms, and said,--\\n\\n\\\"Oh! then--\\\" began Tricksey-Wee, feeling rather frightened; but before, she could finish her sentence she heard the sound of footsteps very far, apart and very heavy. The next moment, who should come running towards, her, full speed, and as pale as death, but Buffy-Bob. She held out her, arms, and he ran into them. But when she tried to kiss him, she only, kissed the back of his head; for his white face and round eyes were, turned to the door.\\n\\nuneven space lay around them, out of which spread boughs in every, direction, the smallest of them as big as the biggest tree in the, country of common people. Overhead were leaves enough to supply all the, trees they had ever seen. Not much moonlight could come through, but, the leaves would glimmer white in the wind at times. The tree was full, of giant birds. Every now and then, one would sweep through, with a, great noise. But, except an occasional chirp, sounding like a shrill, pipe in a great organ, they made no noise. All at once an owl began to, hoot. He thought he was singing. As soon as he began, other birds, replied, making rare game of him. To their astonishment, the children, found they could understand every word they sang. And what they sang, was something like this:--\\n\\n\\\"I reassert my former assertion,\\\" began Kopy-Keck, with a plunge., \\\"There is not a fault in the princess, body or soul; only they are, wrong put together. Listen to me now, Hum-Drum, and I will tell you in, brief what I think. Don't speak. Don't answer me. I _won't_ hear you, till I have done.-- At that decisive moment, when souls seek their, appointed habitations, two eager souls met, struck, rebounded, lost, their way, and arrived each at the wrong place. The soul of the, princess was one of those, and she went far astray. She does not belong, by rights to this world at all, but to some other planet, probably, Mercury. Her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural, influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal, frame. She cares for nothing here. There is no relation between her and, this world.\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said the prince; and, catching her up in his arms, he, sprang with her from the rock. The princess had just time to give one, delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them. When, they came to the surface, she found that, for a moment or two, she, could not even laugh, for she had gone down with such a rush, that it, was with difficulty she recovered her breath. The instant they reached, the surface--\\n\\nThe owl spread out his silent, soft, sly wings, and lighting between, Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob, nearly smothered them, closing up one under, each wing. It was like being buried in a down bed. But the owl did not, like anything between his sides and his wings, so he opened his wings, again, and the children made haste to get out. Tricksey-Wee immediately, went in front of the bird, and looking up into his huge face, which was, as round as the eyes of the giantess's spectacles, and much bigger\\n\\nhowever, she could not see much, because of the ivy and other creeping, plants which had straggled across her window. All at once she saw an, ape making faces at her out of the mirror, and the heads carved upon a, great old wardrobe grinning fearfully. Then two old spider-legged, chairs came forward into the middle of the room, and began to dance a, queer, old-fashioned dance. This set her laughing, and she forgot the, ape and the grinning heads. So the fairies saw they had made a mistake\\n\\nThe prince took off his scarf, then his sword-belt, then his tunic, and, tied them all together, and let them down. But the line was far too, short. He unwound his turban, and added it to the rest, when it was all, but long enough; and his purse completed it. The princess just managed, to lay hold of the knot of money, and was beside him in a moment. This, rock was much higher than the other, and the splash and the dive were, tremendous. The princess was in ecstasies of delight, and their swim, was delicious.\\n\\nShe hurried out, and fell, tired and happy, upon the yellow sand of the, shore. There she lay, half asleep with weariness and rest, listening to, the low plash and retreat of the tiny waves, which seemed ever enticing, the land to leave off being land, and become sea. And as she lay, her, eyes were fixed upon the foot of a great rainbow standing far away, against the sky on the other side of the sea. At length she fell fast, asleep.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! but you might do better than that,\\\" said the spider.--\\\"Now we have, resolved to help you. Here is a little bag of spider-juice. The giants, cannot bear spiders, and this juice is dreadful poison to them. We are, all ready to go up with you, and drive the eagle away. Then you must, put the heart into this other bag, and bring it down with you; for then, the giant will be in your power.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish I hadn't one either,\\\" rejoined the princess; \\\"it is so stupid!, I have a great mind,\\\" she continued, \\\"to play them all a trick. Why, couldn't they leave me alone? They won't trust me in the lake for a, single night!--You see where that green light is burning? That is the, window of my room. Now if you would just swim there with me very, quietly, and when we are all but under the balcony, give me such a, push--_up_ you call it--as you did a little while ago, I should be able, to catch hold of the balcony, and get in at the window; and then they, may look for me till to-morrow morning!\\\"\\n\\n, After a long avoidance of the painful subject, the king and queen, resolved to hold a council of three upon it; and so they sent for the, princess. In she came, sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece, of furniture to another, and put herself at last in an armchair, in a, sitting posture. Whether she could be said to _sit_, seeing she, received no support from the seat of the chair, I do not pretend to, determine.\\n\\nIn his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess;, but as everybody said she was bewitched, he never dreamed that she, could bewitch him. For what indeed could a prince do with a princess, that had lost her gravity? Who could tell what she might not lose next?, She might lose her visibility, or her tangibility; or, in short, the, power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium; so that he, should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive. Of course, he made no further inquiries about her.\\n\\nleaving them clear for such as might follow. Now a wonderful form, half, bird-like half human, would float across on outspread sailing pinions., Anon an exquisite shadow group of gambolling children would be followed, by the loveliest female form, and that again by the grand stride of a, Titanic shape, each disappearing in the surrounding press of shadowy, foliage. Sometimes a profile of unspeakable beauty or grandeur would, appear for a moment and vanish. Sometimes they seemed lovers that, passed linked arm in arm, sometimes father and son, sometimes brothers, in loving contest, sometimes sisters entwined in gracefullest community, of complex form. Sometimes wild horses would tear across, free, or, bestrode by noble shadows of ruling men. But some of the things which, pleased them most they never knew how to describe.\\n\\nas he always kept his word, he was afraid he might have to do the same, to them all; and he did not like boiled boys. He like to eat them, crisp, as radishes, whether forked or not, ought to be eaten. He then, sat down, and asked his wife if his supper was ready. She looked into, the pot, and throwing the boy out with the ladle, as if he had been a, black beetle that had tumbled in and had had the worst of it, answered, that she thought it was. Whereupon he rose to help her; and taking the, pot from the fire, poured the whole contents, bubbling and splashing\\n\\nand sent the chairs back to their places. But they knew that she had, been reading the story of Silverhair all day. So the next moment she, heard the voices of the three bears upon the stair, big voice, middle, voice, and little voice, and she heard their soft, heavy tread, as if, they had had stockings over their boots, coming nearer and nearer to, the door of her room, till she could bear it no longer. She did just as, Silverhair did, and as the fairies wanted her to do: she darted to the, window, pulled it open, got upon the ivy, and so scrambled to the, ground. She then fled to the forest as fast as she could run.\\n\\nEvery one ran to the queen's room. But the queen could give no orders., They soon found out, however, that the princess was missing, and in a, moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden; and in one minute, more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping, of hands. They had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush, to, which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her, finishing its, mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little, white sleeper. Startled by the noise the servants made, she woke, and\\n\\nTangle followed the serpent. But she could not go far without looking, back at the marvellous child. He stood alone in the midst of the, glowing desert, beside a fountain of red flame that had burst forth at, his feet, his naked whiteness glimmering a pale rosy red in the torrid, fire. There he stood, looking after her, till, from the lengthening, distance, she could see him no more. The serpent went straight on\\n\\n, The princess burst into a passion of tears, and _fell_ on the floor., There she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased. All the pent-up, crying of her life was spent now. And a rain came on, such as had never, been seen in that country. The sun shone all the time, and the great, drops, which fell straight to the earth, shone likewise. The palace was, in the heart of a rainbow. It was a rain of rubies, and sapphires, and, emeralds, and topazes. The torrents poured from the mountains like, molten gold; and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet, the, lake would have overflowed and inundated the country. It was full from, shore to shore.\\n\\nNow, although she did not know it, this was the very best way she could, have gone; for nothing is ever so mischievous in its own place as it is, out of it; and, besides, these mischievous creatures were only the, children of Fairyland, as it were, and there are many other beings, there as well; and if a wanderer gets in among them, the good ones will, always help him more than the evil ones will be able to hurt him.\\n\\nNow at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese, philosophers--by name, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck. For them the king sent;, and straightway they came. In a long speech he communicated to them, what they knew very well already--as who did not?--namely, the peculiar, condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt;, and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause, and probable cure of her _infirmity_. The king laid stress upon the, word, but failed to discover his own pun. The queen laughed; but, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck heard with humility and retired in silence.\\n\\nHe did not speak again. The princess gave him some wine for the last, time: he was past eating. Then she sat down again, and looked at him., The water rose and rose. It touched his chin. It touched his lower lip., It touched between his lips. He shut them hard to keep it out. The, princess began to feel strange. It touched his upper lip. He breathed, through his nostrils. The princess looked wild. It covered his, nostrils. Her eyes looked scared, and shone strange in the moonlight., His head fell back; the water closed over it, and the bubbles of his, last breath bubbled up through the water. The princess gave a shriek\\n\\nwith her face bowed upon her knees. Seven years had she sat there, waiting. She lifted her head as Mossy drew near. It was Tangle. Her, hair had grown to her feet, and was rippled like the windless sea on, broad sands. Her face was beautiful, like her grandmother's, and as, still and peaceful as that of the Old Man of the Fire. Her form was, tall and noble. Yet Mossy knew her at once.\\n\\n\\\"She will die if I don't do it, and life would be nothing to me without, her; so I shall lose nothing by doing it. And life will be as pleasant, to her as ever, for she will soon forget me. And there will be so much, more beauty and happiness in the world!--To be sure, I shall not see, it.\\\" (Here the poor prince gave a sigh.) \\\"How lovely the lake will be, in the moonlight, with that glorious creature sporting in it like a, wild goddess!--It is rather hard to be drowned by inches, though. Let, me see--that will be seventy inches of me to drown.\\\" (Here he tried to, laugh, but could not.) \\\"The longer the better, however,\\\" he resumed\\n\\nBut how was this to be brought about? Therein lay all the, difficulty--to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough. To, make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh. They sent, for a professional beggar; commanded him to prepare his most touching, oracle of woe; helped him, out of the court charade-box, to whatever he, wanted for dressing up, and promised great rewards in the event of his, success. But it was all in vain. She listened to the mendicant artist's, story, and gazed at his marvellous make-up, till she could contain, herself no longer, and went into the most undignified contortions for, relief, shrieking, positively screeching with laughter.\\n\\nOne lovely evening, after wandering about for many days, he found that, he was approaching the outskirts of this forest; for the trees had got, so thin that he could see the sunset through them; and he soon came, upon a kind of heath. Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood;, but by this time it was getting late, and there was nobody in the, fields to direct him.\\n\\nDay after day he held on, and he thought he had no guide. He did not, see how a shining fish under the water directed his steps. He crossed, the sea, and came to a great precipice of rock, up which he could, discover but one path. Nor did this lead him farther than half-way up, the rock, where it ended on a platform. Here he stood and pondered.--It, could not be that the way stopped here, else what was the path for? It, was a rough path, not very plain, yet certainly a path.--He examined, the face of the rock. It was smooth as glass. But as his eyes kept, roving hopelessly over it, something glittered, and he caught sight of, a row of small sapphires. They bordered a little hole in the rock.\\n\\nand took something like an egg from under it. He next drew a long, curved line in the sand with his finger, and laid the egg in it. He, then spoke something Tangle could not understand. The egg broke, a, small snake came out, and, lying in the line in the sand, grew and grew, till he filled it. The moment he was thus full-grown, he began to glide, away, undulating like a sea-wave.\\n\\nAnd if he tried to catch her, she glided from him in an instant, not in, the least afraid of him, but thinking it part of the game not to be, caught. With one push of her foot, she would be floating in the air, above his head; or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and, sideways, like a great butterfly. It happened several times, when her, father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private\\n\\n, Meantime, notwithstanding awkward occurrences, and griefs that she, brought upon her parents, the little princess laughed and grew--not, fat, but plump and tall. She reached the age of seventeen, without, having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney; by rescuing her, from which, a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face., Nor, thoughtless as she was, had she committed anything worse than, laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way. When she was, told, for the sake of experiment, that General Clanrunfort was cut to, pieces with all his troops, she laughed; when she heard that the enemy, was on his way to besiege her papa's capital, she laughed hugely; but, when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the, mercy of the enemy's soldiery--why, then she laughed immoderately. She, never could be brought to see the serious side of anything. When her, mother cried, she said,--\\n\\nSo he lay down on the ground, and about him on every side, and over his, head, was the constant play of the wonderful shadows. He could look, through them, and see the one behind the other, till they mixed in a, mass of darkness. Tangle, too, lay admiring, and wondering, and longing, after the country whence the shadows came. When they were rested they, rose and pursued their journey.\\n\\nSo she put on her best gown, went to the palace, was kindly received by, the happy monarch, who forgot that he had forgotten her, and took her, place in the procession to the royal chapel. When they were all, gathered about the font, she contrived to get next to it, and throw, something into the water; after which she maintained a very respectful, demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face. But at that, moment she turned round in her place three times, and muttered the, following words, loud enough for those beside her to hear:--\\n\\nWhen he woke in the morning the sun was looking straight into his eyes., He turned away from it, and the same moment saw a brilliant little, thing lying on the moss within a foot of his face. It was the golden, key. The pipe of it was of plain gold, as bright as gold could be. The, handle was curiously wrought and set with sapphires. In a terror of, delight he put out his hand and took it, and had it.\\n\\nThe king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to, cool, and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man, who was willing to be useful in the present emergency, seeing that in, the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his, majesty's own hand. \\\"Oh!\\\" said he at last, putting up his sword with, difficulty, it was so long; \\\"I am obliged to you, you young fool! Take, a glass of wine?\\\"\\n\\ntill he could not bear it any longer, and gave her a box on the ear., Tricksey-Wee cried; and Buffy-Bob was so sorry and so ashamed of, himself that he cried too, and ran off into the wood. He was so long, gone that Tricksey-Wee began to be frightened, for she was very fond of, her brother; and she was so distressed that she had first teased him, and then cried, that at last she ran into the wood to look for him\\n\\n\\\"I will leave it a month longer where it is, and then I will give it to, the Queen of the Kangaroos, and she will carry it in her pouch for me., It is best to change its place, you know, lest my enemies should scent, it out. But, dear Doodlem, it's a fretting care to have a heart of, one's own to look after. The responsibility is too much for me. If it, were not for a bite of a radish now and then, I never could bear it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She must therefore be taught, by the sternest compulsion, to take an, interest in the earth as the earth. She must study every department of, its history--its animal history; its vegetable history; its mineral, history; its social history; its moral history; its political history;, its scientific history; its literary history; its musical history; its, artistical history; above all, its metaphysical history. She must begin, with the Chinese dynasty and end with Japan. But first of all she must, study geology, and especially the history of the extinct races of, animals--their natures, their habits, their loves, their hates, their, revenges. She must--\\\"\\n\\nWhen he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave, he saw the, princess already floating about in the lake, attended by the king or, queen--whom he knew by their crowns--and a great company in lovely, little boats, with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow, and, flags and streamers of a great many more. It was a very bright day, and, soon the prince, burned up with the heat, began to long for the cold, water and the cool princess. But he had to endure till twilight; for, the boats had provisions on board, and it was not till the sun went, down that the gay party began to vanish. Boat after boat drew away to, the shore, following that of the king and queen, till only one\\n\\nBut so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair, trial, that he put himself in a rage one day, and, rushing up to her, room, gave her an awful whipping. Yet not a tear would flow. She looked, grave, and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming--that was, all. The good old tyrant, though he put on his best gold spectacles to, look, could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her, eyes.\\n\\nShe took Tangle on her knee, and began to sing to her--such songs as, made her wish she could listen to them for ever. But at length in, rushed the shining fish, and snuggled down in the pot. It was followed, by a youth who had outgrown his worn garments. His face was ruddy with, health, and in his hand he carried a little jewel, which sparkled in, the firelight.\\n\\nAs evening grew on, the shadows fell deeper and rose higher. At length, they reached a place where they rose above their heads, and made all, dark around them. Then they took hold of each other's hand, and walked, on in silence and in some dismay. They felt the gathering darkness, and, something strangely solemn besides, and the beauty of the shadows, ceased to delight them. All at once Tangle found that she had not a, hold of Mossy's hand, though when she lost it she could not tell.\\n\\nstaring, and forgetting to get out. But the princess disappearing, he, scrambled on shore, and went in the direction of the tree. There he, found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem. But in, the darkness of the wood, the prince continued in some bewilderment as, to what the phenomenon could be; until, reaching the ground, and seeing, him standing there, she caught hold of him, and said,--\\n\\nNow it does not generally matter if somebody _is_ forgotten, only you, must mind who. Unfortunately, the king forgot without intending to, forget; and so the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit, which was, awkward. For the princess was the king's own sister; and he ought not, to have forgotten her. But she had made herself so disagreeable to the, old king, their father, that he had forgotten her in making his will;, and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his, invitations. But poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind, of them. Why don't they? The king could not see into the garret she, lived in, could he?\\n\\nHe stood gazing at it till he forgot himself with delight--even forgot, the key which he had come to seek. And as he stood it grew more, wonderful still. For in each of the colours, which was as large as the, column of a church, he could faintly see beautiful forms slowly, ascending as if by the steps of a winding stair. The forms appeared, irregularly--now one, now many, now several, now none--men and women, and children--all different, all beautiful.\\n\\nThe fish was out of the door in a moment. Then the lady told Tangle it, was time to go to bed; and, opening another door in the side of the, cottage, showed her a little arbour, cool and green, with a bed of, purple heath growing in it, upon which she threw a large wrapper made, of the feathered skins of the wise fishes, shining gorgeous in the, firelight.\\n\\nTangle now remarked that the lid was on the pot. But the lady took no, further notice of it till they had eaten the fish, which Tangle found, nicer than any fish she had ever tasted before. It was as white as, snow, and as delicate as cream. And the moment she had swallowed a, mouthful of it, a change she could not describe began to take place in, her. She heard a murmuring all about her, which became more and more, articulate, and at length, as she went on eating, grew intelligible. By, the time she had finished her share, the sounds of all the animals in, the forest came crowding through the door to her ears; for the door, still stood wide open, though it was pitch dark outside; and they were, no longer sounds only; they were speech, and speech that she could, understand. She could tell what the insects in the cottage were saying, to each other too. She had even a suspicion that the trees and flowers, all about the cottage were holding midnight communications with each, other; but what they said she could not hear.\\n\\non to the she-eagle, and buried themselves in her feathers. In a moment, she became very restless, and went pecking about with her beak. All at, once she spread out her wings, with a sound like a whirlwind, and flew, off to bathe in the sea; and then the spiders began to drop from her in, all directions on their gossamer wings. The children had to hold fast, to keep the wind of the eagle's flight from blowing them off. As soon, as it was over, they looked into the nest, and there lay the giant's, heart--an awful and ugly thing.\\n\\nAnd the king said to himself, \\\"All the queens of my acquaintance have, children, some three, some seven, and some as many as twelve; and my, queen has not one. I feel ill-used.\\\" So he made up his mind to be cross, with his wife about it. But she bore it all like a good patient queen, as she was. Then the king grew very cross indeed. But the queen, pretended to take it all as a joke, and a very good one too.\\n\\n, The princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion, and she, could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour. Imagine then her, consternation, when, diving with the prince one night, a sudden, suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be., The prince could not imagine what had happened. She shot to the, surface, and, without a word, swam at full speed towards the higher, side of the lake. He followed, begging to know if she was ill, or what, was the matter. She never turned her head, or took the smallest notice, of his question. Arrived at the shore, she coasted the rocks with, minute inspection. But she was not able to come to a conclusion, for, the moon was very small, and so she could not see well. She turned, therefore and swam home, without saying a word to explain her conduct, to the prince, of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious. He, withdrew to his cave, in great perplexity and distress.\\n\\nWhen the strange fact came to be known, there was a terrible commotion, in the palace. The occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally, a repetition of the nurse's experience. Astonished that he felt no, weight when the child was laid in his arms, he began to wave her up, and--not down, for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before, and, there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction, as was, testified by her peals of tiny laughter. The king stood staring up in, speechless amazement, and trembled so that his beard shook like grass, in the wind. At last, turning to the queen, who was just as, horror-struck as himself, he said, gasping, staring, and stammering,--\\n\\nBut this house was quite a shame, and the fairies in the forest could, not endure it. They tried everything on the maids without effect, and, at last resolved upon making a clean riddance, beginning with the, child. They ought to have known that it was not her fault, but they, have little principle and much mischief in them, and they thought that, if they got rid of her the maids would be sure to be turned away.\\n\\n, Never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the, prince had a single interview with her. He had seen her once or twice, in the lake; but as far as he could discover, she had not been in it, any more at night. He had sat and sung, and looked in vain for his, Nereid; while she, like a true Nereid, was wasting away with her lake\\n\\nThen she went to an old chest in the room, and opening it, took out, what looked like a piece of dried seaweed. This she threw into a tub of, water. Then she threw some powder into the water, and stirred it with, her bare arm, muttering over it words of hideous sound, and yet more, hideous import. Then she set the tub aside, and took from the chest a, huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys, that clattered in her shaking, hands. Then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all. Before she had, finished, out from the tub, the water of which had kept on a slow, motion ever since she had ceased stirring it, came the head and half, the body of a huge gray snake. But the witch did not look round. It, grew out of the tub, waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow, horizontal motion, till it reached the princess, when it laid its head, upon her shoulder, and gave a low hiss in her ear. She started--but, with joy; and seeing the head resting on her shoulder, drew it towards, her and kissed it. Then she drew it all out of the tub, and wound it, round her body. It was one of those dreadful creatures which few have, ever beheld--the White Snakes of Darkness.\\n\\nThe moment she looked in his face, she saw that he was a youth of, marvellous beauty. He sat entranced with the delight of what he beheld, in a mirror of something like silver, which lay on the floor at his, feet, and which from behind she had taken for his white beard. He sat, on, heedless of her presence, pale with the joy of his vision. She, stood and watched him. At length, all trembling, she spoke. But her, voice made no sound. Yet the youth lifted up his head. He showed no, surprise, however, at seeing her--only smiled a welcome.\\n\\nNo sooner was the heart out of the bag, than it expanded to the size of, a bullock; and the giant, with a yell of rage and vengeance, rushed on, the two children, who had stepped sideways from the terrible heart. But, Buffy-Bob was too quick for Thunderthump. He sprang to the heart, and, buried his knife in it, up to the hilt. A fountain of blood spouted, from it; and with a dreadful groan the giant fell dead at the feet of, little Tricksey-Wee, who could not help being sorry for him after all.\\n\\nand with their wet feathers washed her quite clean. Then the lady, who, had been looking on all the time, spoke again; whereupon some thirty or, forty of the fishes rose out of the water underneath Tangle, and so, bore her up to the arms the lady held out to take her. She carried her, back to the fire, and, having dried her well, opened a chest, and, taking out the finest linen garments, smelling of grass and lavender\\n\\nAs soon as the fish was eaten, the lady went to the fire and took the, lid off the pot. A lovely little creature in human shape, with large, white wings, rose out of it, and flew round and round the roof of the, cottage; then dropped, fluttering, and nestled in the lap of the lady., She spoke to it some strange words, carried it to the door, and threw, it out into the darkness. Tangle heard the flapping of its wings die, away in the distance.\\n\\nShe took off the girl's night-gown, rose with her in her arms, and, going to the wall of the cottage, opened a door. Then Tangle saw a deep, tank, the sides of which were filled with green plants, which had, flowers of all colours. There was a roof over it like the roof of the, cottage. It was filled with beautiful clear water, in which swam a, multitude of such fishes as the one that had led her to the cottage. It, was the light their colours gave that showed the place in which they, were.\\n\\nNext day she made many observations, which, alas! strengthened her, fears. She saw that the banks were too dry; and that the grass on the, shore, and the trailing plants on the rocks, were withering away. She, caused marks to be made along the borders, and examined them, day after, day, in all directions of the wind; till at last the horrible idea, became a certain fact--that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking.\\n\\nlost his hold of his daughter; not, however, before imparting to her, the downward tendency of his own person, though in a somewhat different, direction; for, as the king fell into the boat, she fell into the, water. With a burst of delightful laughter she disappeared in the lake., A cry of horror ascended from the boats. They had never seen the, princess go down before. Half the men were under water in a moment; but, they had all, one after another, come up to the surface again for, breath, when--tinkle, tinkle, babble, and gush! came the princess's, laugh over the water from far away. There she was, swimming like a, swan. Nor would she come out for king or queen, chancellor or daughter., She was perfectly obstinate.\\n\\ndrying up within her, first to mud, then to madness and death. She thus, brooded over the change, with all its dreadful accompaniments, till she, was nearly distracted. As for the prince, she had forgotten him., However much she had enjoyed his company in the water, she did not care, for him without it. But she seemed to have forgotten her father and, mother too. The lake went on sinking. Small slimy spots began to, appear, which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the, water. These grew to broad patches of mud, which widened and spread\\n\\nHe drew nearer to the rainbow. It vanished. He started back a step in, dismay. It was there again, as beautiful as ever. So he contented, himself with standing as near it as he might, and watching the forms, that ascended the glorious colours towards the unknown height of the, arch, which did not end abruptly, but faded away in the blue air, so, gradually that he could not say where it ceased.\\n\\nAt last they came to the foot of Mount Skycrack. It stood in a plain, alone, and shot right up, I don't know how many thousand feet, into the, air, a long, narrow, spearlike mountain. The whole face of it, from top, to bottom, was covered with a network of spiders' webs, with threads of, various sizes, from that of silk to that of whipcord. The webs shook, and quivered, and waved in the sun, glittering like silver. All about, ran huge greedy spiders, catching huge silly flies, and devouring them.\\n\\nSo the children went on because they did not know what else to do. They, found the way very rough and difficult, the tree was so full of humps, and hollows. Now and then they plashed into a pool of rain; now and, then they came upon twigs growing out of the trunk where they had no, business, and they were as large as full-grown poplars. Sometimes they, came upon great cushions of soft moss, and on one of them they lay down, and rested. But they had not lain long before they spied a large, nightingale sitting on a branch, with its bright eyes looking up at the, moon. In a moment more he began to sing, and the birds about him began, to reply, but in a different tone from that in which they had replied, to the owl. Oh, the birds did call the nightingale such pretty names!, The nightingale sang, and the birds replied like this:--\\n\\nLooking down, they could not tell whether the valley below was a grassy, plain or a great still lake. They had never seen any space look like, it. The way to it was difficult and dangerous, but down the narrow path, they went, and reached the bottom in safety. They found it composed of, smooth, light-coloured sandstone, undulating in parts, but mostly, level. It was no wonder to them now that they had not been able to tell, what it was, for this surface was everywhere crowded with shadows. The, mass was chiefly made up of the shadows of leaves innumerable, of all, lovely and imaginative forms, waving to and fro, floating and quivering, in the breath of a breeze whose motion was unfelt, whose sound was, unheard. No forests clothed the mountain-sides, no trees were anywhere, to be seen, and yet the shadows of the leaves, branches, and stems of, all various trees covered the valley as far as their eyes could reach., They soon spied the shadows of flowers mingled with those of the, leaves, and now and then the shadow of a bird with open beak, and, throat distended with song. At times would appear the forms of strange\\n\\nWhen the moon came, she brought them fresh pleasure. Everything looked, strange and new in her light, with an old, withered, yet unfading, newness. When the moon was nearly full, one of their great delights, was, to dive deep in the water, and then, turning round, look up, through it at the great blot of light close above them, shimmering and, trembling and wavering, spreading and contracting, seeming to melt, away, and again grow solid. Then they would shoot up through the blot;, and lo! there was the moon, far off, clear and steady and cold, and, very lovely, at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs, as, the princess said.\\n\\nWhen the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her, she was, so transported that she jumped off the bed, feeble as she was, and, danced about the room for joy. She did not care who the man was; that, was nothing to her. The hole wanted stopping; and if only a man would, do, why, take one. In an hour or two more everything was ready. Her, maid dressed her in haste, and they carried her to the side of the, lake. When she saw it she shrieked, and covered her face with her, hands. They bore her across to the stone, where they had already placed, a little boat for her. The water was not deep enough to float it, but, they hoped it would be, before long. They laid her on cushions, placed, in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things, and stretched a, canopy over all.\\n\\n\\\"Hold, h-o-o-old!\\\" roared Hum-Drum. \\\"It is certainly my turn now. My, rooted and insubvertible conviction is, that the causes of the, anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely, physical. But that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist., Hear my opinion.--From some cause or other, of no importance to our, inquiry, the motion of her heart has been reversed. That remarkable, combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way--I, mean in the case of the princess: it draws in where it should force, out, and forces out where it should draw in. The offices of the, auricles and the ventricles are subverted. The blood is sent forth by, the veins, and returns by the arteries. Consequently it is running the, wrong way through all her corporeal organism--lungs and all. Is it then, at all mysterious, seeing that such is the case, that on the other, particular of gravitation as well, she should differ from normal, humanity? My proposal for the cure is this:--\\n\\nBut this was not enough. Now that she had tasted revenge, she lost her, patience. Without further measures, the lake would be too long in, disappearing. So the next night, with the last shred of the dying old, moon rising, she took some of the water in which she had revived the, snake, put it in a bottle, and set out, accompanied by her cat. Before, morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake, muttering fearful, words as she crossed every stream, and casting into it some of the, water out of her bottle. When she had finished the circuit she muttered, yet again, and flung a handful of water towards the moon. Thereupon, every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble, dying away like, the pulse of a dying man. The next day there was no sound of falling, water to be heard along the borders of the lake. The very courses were, dry; and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides., And not alone had the fountains of mother Earth ceased to flow; for all, the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully--only without, tears.\\n\\nGradually the stream grew shallower. At length she could hardly keep, her head under. Then the water could carry her no farther. She rose, from the channel, and went step for step down the burning descent. The, water ceased altogether. The heat was terrible. She felt scorched to, the bone, but it did not touch her strength. It grew hotter and hotter., She said, \\\"I can bear it no longer.\\\" Yet she went on.\\n\\nand crossing it, unlocked another door into a dark, narrow passage. She, locked this also behind her, and descended a few more steps. If anyone, had followed the witch-princess, he would have heard her unlock exactly, one hundred doors, and descend a few steps after unlocking each. When, she had unlocked the last, she entered a vast cave, the roof of which, was supported by huge natural pillars of rock. Now this roof was the, under side of the bottom of the lake.\\n\\nSo Tricksey took her bag, and squeezed a drop out of it upon the heart., She thought she heard the giant give a far-off roar of pain, and she, nearly fell from her seat with terror. The heart instantly began to, shrink. It shrunk and shrivelled till it was nearly gone; and Buffy-Bob, caught it up and put it into his bag. Then the two spiders turned and, went down again as fast as they could. Before they got to the bottom\\n\\nThere was such an awfulness of absolute repose on the face of the child, that Tangle stood dumb before him. He had no smile, but the love in his, large gray eyes was deep as the centre. And with the repose there lay, on his face a shimmer as of moonlight, which seemed as if any moment it, might break into such a ravishing smile as would cause the beholder to, weep himself to death. But the smile never came, and the moonlight lay, there unbroken. For the heart of the child was too deep for any smile, to reach from it to his face.\\n\\nwithout looking up, or seeming to know that there was a stranger in his, deep-withdrawn cell. Diligently as a lace-maker shifts her bobbins, he, shifted and arranged his balls. Flashes of meaning would now pass from, them to Tangle, and now again all would be not merely obscure, but, utterly dark. She stood looking for a long time, for there was, fascination in the sight; and the longer she looked the more an, indescribable vague intelligence went on rousing itself in her mind., For seven years she had stood there watching the naked child with his, coloured balls, and it seemed to her like seven hours, when all at once, the shape the balls took, she knew not why, reminded her of the Valley, of Shadows, and she spoke:--\\n\\nexcept for the great fire that was burning there, diminished to a spark, in the distance. Towards this fire she ran as fast as she could, and, was not far from it when something fell before her with a great, clatter, over which she tumbled, and went rolling on the floor. She was, not much hurt however, and got up in a moment. Then she saw that what, she had fallen over was not unlike a great iron bucket. When she, examined it more closely, she discovered that it was a thimble; and, looking up to see who had dropped it, beheld a huge face, with, spectacles as big as the round windows in a church, bending over her\\n\\nthat the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down, she flew, from her arms towards the ceiling. Happily, the resistance of the air, brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it. There she, remained, horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms, kicking and, laughing amazingly. The nurse in terror flew to the bell, and begged, the footman, who answered it, to bring up the house-steps directly., Trembling in every limb, she climbed upon the steps, and had to stand, upon the very top, and reach up, before she could catch the floating, tail of the baby's long clothes.\\n\\nAnd moving a slide in the wall of his house, he first looked out, and, then tapped upon a thick piece of crystal that filled the round, opening. Tangle came up behind him, and peeping through the window into, the heart of the great deep green ocean, saw the most curious, creatures, some very ugly, all very odd, and with especially queer, mouths, swimming about everywhere, above and below, but all coming, towards the window in answer to the tap of the Old Man of the Sea. Only, a few could get their mouths against the glass; but those who were, floating miles away yet turned their heads towards it. The old man, looked through the whole flock carefully for some minutes, and then, turning to Tangle, said,--\\n\\nShe laid hold first of one leg, and then of the other, and pulled and, tugged, but she could not move either. She stopped to take breath, and, that made her think that he could not get any breath. She was frantic., She got hold of him, and held his head above the water, which was, possible now his hands were no longer on the hole. But it was of no, use, for he was past breathing.\\n\\nI refer anyone who doubts this part of my story to certain chronicles, of Giantland preserved among the Celtic nations. It was quite a common, thing for a giant to put his heart out to nurse, because he did not, like the trouble and responsibility of doing it himself; although I, must confess it was a dangerous sort of plan to take, especially with, such a delicate viscus as the heart.\\n\\nShe spent that day in the wood, listening to the birds and beasts and, creeping things. She understood all that they said, though she could, not repeat a word of it; and every kind had a different language, while, there was a common though more limited understanding between all the, inhabitants of the forest. She saw nothing of the beautiful lady, but, she felt that she was near her all the time; and she took care not to, go out of sight of the cottage. It was round, like a snow-hut or a, wigwam; and she could see neither door nor window in it. The fact was\\n\\nand damp. A little stream spouted from a rent in the rock and fell into, a basin of moss. She plunged her face into it and drank. Then she, lifted her head and looked around. Then she rose and looked again. She, saw no one in the cave. But the moment she stood upright she had a, marvellous sense that she was in the secret of the earth and all its, ways. Everything she had seen, or learned from books; all that her, grandmother had said or sung to her; all the talk of the beasts, birds\\n\\n, Her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity. If you, ask me how this was effected, I answer, \\\"In the easiest way in the, world. She had only to destroy gravitation.\\\" For the princess was a, philosopher, and knew all the _ins_ and _outs_ of the laws of, gravitation as well as the _ins_ and _outs_ of her boot-lace. And being, a witch as well, she could abrogate those laws in a moment; or at least, so clog their wheels and rust their bearings, that they would not work, at all. But we have more to do with what followed than with how it was, done.\\n\\nShe was standing at the foot of a tree in the twilight, listening to a, quarrel between a mole and a squirrel, in which the mole told the, squirrel that the tail was the best of him, and the squirrel called the, mole Spade-fists, when, the darkness having deepened around her, she, became aware of something shining in her face, and looking round, saw, that the door of the cottage was open, and the red light of the fire, flowing from it like a river through the darkness. She left Mole and, Squirrel to settle matters as they might, and darted off to the, cottage. Entering, she found the pot boiling on the fire, and the, grand, lovely lady sitting on the other side of it.\\n\\nAt last there was not one step more, and she found herself in a, glimmering cave. On a stone in the middle of it sat a figure with its, back towards her--the figure of an old man bent double with age. From, behind she could see his white beard spread out on the rocky floor in, front of him. He did not move as she entered, so she passed round that, she might stand before him and speak to him.\\n\\nAfter travelling for another hour, his horse, quite worn out with long, labour and lack of food, fell, and was unable to rise again. So he, continued his journey on foot. At length he entered another wood--not a, wild forest, but a civilized wood, through which a footpath led him to, the side of a lake. Along this path the prince pursued his way through, the gathering darkness. Suddenly he paused, and listened. Strange, sounds came across the water. It was, in fact, the princess laughing., Now there was something odd in her laugh, as I have already hinted, for, the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity;, and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming., Looking over the lake, he saw something white in the water; and, in an, instant, he had torn off his tunic, kicked off his sandals, and plunged, in. He soon reached the white object, and found that it was a woman., There was not light enough to show that she was a princess, but quite, enough to show that she was a lady, for it does not want much light to, see that.\\n\\nOne summer evening, during the carnival of the country, she had been, taken upon the lake by the king and queen, in the royal barge. They, were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats., In the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's, barge, for his daughter, who was a great favourite with her, was in it, with her father. Now though the old king rarely condescended to make, light of his misfortune, yet, happening on this occasion to be in a, particularly good humour, as the barges approached each other, he, caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge. He, lost his balance, however, and, dropping into the bottom of the barge\\n\\nThe nightingale sang so sweetly, that the children would have fallen, asleep but for fear of losing any of the song. When the nightingale, stopped they got up and wandered on. They did not know where they were, going, but they thought it best to keep going on, because then they, might come upon something or other. They were very sorry they had, forgotten to ask the nightingale about the eagle's nest, but his music, had put everything else out of their heads. They resolved, however, not, to forget the next time they had a chance. So they went on and on, till, they were both tired, and Tricksey-Wee said at last, trying to laugh,--\\n\\nThe poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had. It was, awful to her to see the lake, which she loved more than any living, thing, lie dying before her eyes. It sank away, slowly vanishing. The, tops of rocks that had never been seen till now, began to appear far, down in the clear water. Before long they were dry in the sun. It was, fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and, festering, full of lovely creatures dying, and ugly creatures coming to, life, like the unmaking of a world. And how hot the sun would be, without any lake! She could not bear to swim in it any more, and began, to pine away. Her life seemed bound up with it; and ever as the lake, sank, she pined. People said she would not live an hour after the lake, was gone.\\n\\nThe only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty, hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her. But she was sorry for, it the very next day, when she heard that the water had undermined her, house, and that it had fallen in the night, burying her in its ruins;, whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body. There she lies to this, day.\\n\\n\\\"Phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety. Let it, be affected, if necessary, in a warm bath. When she is reduced to a, state of perfect asphyxy, apply a ligature to the left ankle, drawing, it as tight as the bone will bear. Apply, at the same moment, another, of equal tension around the right wrist. By means of plates constructed, for the purpose, place the other foot and hand under the receivers of, two air-pumps. Exhaust the receivers. Exhibit a pint of French brandy\\n\\nTricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob peered through the bristles, and discovered, a row of little boys, about a dozen, with very fat faces and goggle, eyes, sitting before the fire, and looking stupidly into it., Thunderthump intended the most of these for pickling, and was feeding, them well before salting them. Now and then, however, he could not keep, his teeth off them, and would eat one by the bye, without salt.\\n\\n\\\"There is no one here but me,\\\" he answered, smiling. \\\"Some people call, me the Old Man of the Sea. Others have another name for me, and are, terribly frightened when they meet me taking a walk by the shore., Therefore I avoid being seen by them, for they are so afraid, that they, never see what I really am. You see me now.--But I must show you the, way to the Old Man of the Earth.\\\"\\n\\nShe was watched more carefully after this, no doubt; yet it would be, endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity, of the young princess. But there never was a baby in a house, not to, say a palace, that kept the household in such constant good-humour, at, least below-stairs. If it was not easy for her nurses to hold her, at, least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache. And she was so, nice to play at ball with! There was positively no danger of letting, her fall. They might throw her down, or knock her down, or push her, down, but couldn't _let_ her down. It is true, they might let her fly, into the fire or the coal-hole, or through the window; but none of, these accidents had happened as yet. If you heard peals of laughter, resounding from some unknown region, you might be sure enough of the, cause. Going down into the kitchen, or _the room_, you would find Jane, and Thomas, and Robert and Susan, all and sum, playing at ball with the, little princess. She was the ball herself, and did not enjoy it the, less for that. Away she went, flying from one to another, screeching, with laughter. And the servants loved the ball itself better even than, the game. But they had to take some care how they threw her, for if she, received an upward direction, she would never come down again without, being fetched.\\n\\nIn the morning she woke to the rustling of leaves over her head, and, the sound of running water. But, to her surprise, she could find no, door--nothing but the moss-grown wall of the cottage. So she crept, through an opening in the arbour, and stood in the forest. Then she, bathed in a stream that ran merrily through the trees, and felt, happier; for having once been in her grandmother's pond, she must be, clean and tidy ever after; and, having put on her green dress, felt, like a lady.\\n\\n, This was a very disheartening revelation to the king--not that he was, unwilling to sacrifice a subject, but that he was hopeless of finding a, man willing to sacrifice himself. No time was to be lost, however, for, the princess was lying motionless on her bed, and taking no nourishment, but lake-water, which was now none of the best. Therefore the king, caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published, throughout the country.\\n\\nAt length the trees grew smaller, and stood farther apart, and the, ground began to rise, and it got more and more steep, till the trees, were all left behind, and the two were climbing a narrow path with, rocks on each side. Suddenly they came upon a rude doorway, by which, they entered a narrow gallery cut in the rock. It grew darker and, darker, till it was pitch-dark, and they had to feel their way. At, length the light began to return, and at last they came out upon a, narrow path on the face of a lofty precipice. This path went winding, down the rock to a wide plain, circular in shape, and surrounded on all, sides by mountains. Those opposite to them were a great way off, and, towered to an awful height, shooting up sharp, blue, ice-enamelled, pinnacles. An utter silence reigned where they stood. Not even the, sound of water reached them.\\n\\nfar away to the north, they saw a huge peak, like the spire of a, church, going right up into the sky. They thought this must be Mount, Skycrack, and turned their faces towards it. As they went on, they saw, a giant or two, now and then, striding about the fields or through the, woods, but they kept out of their way. Nor were they in much danger;, for it was only one or two of the border giants that were so very fond, of children.\\n\\nIt was a long time before she got reconciled to walking. But the pain, of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things, either of which, would have been sufficient consolation. The first was, that the prince, himself was her teacher; and the second, that she could tumble into the, lake as often as she pleased. Still, she preferred to have the prince, jump in with her; and the splash they made before was nothing to the, splash they made now.\\n\\nHe lay for a while, turning it over and over, and feeding his eyes upon, its beauty. Then he jumped to his feet, remembering that the pretty, thing was of no use to him yet. Where was the lock to which the key, belonged? It must be somewhere, for how could anybody be so silly as, make a key for which there was no lock? Where should he go to look for, it? He gazed about him, up into the air, down to the earth, but saw no, keyhole in the clouds, in the grass, or in the trees.\\n\\nafter some trouble, found them again. Then he made the best of his way, round the lake to the other side. There the wood was wilder, and the, shore steeper--rising more immediately towards the mountains which, surrounded the lake on all sides, and kept sending it messages of, silvery streams from morning to night, and all night long. He soon, found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's, room, and where, even in the broad daylight, he would be in no danger, of being discovered from the opposite shore. It was a sort of cave in, the rock, where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves, and lay, down too tired for hunger to keep him awake. All night long he dreamed, that he was swimming with the princess.\\n\\nNow, all that his great-aunt told the boy about the golden key would, have been nonsense, had it not been that their little house stood on, the borders of Fairyland. For it is perfectly well known that out of, Fairyland nobody ever can find where the rainbow stands. The creature, takes such good care of its golden key, always flitting from place to, place, lest anyone should find it! But in Fairyland it is quite, different. Things that look real in this country look very thin indeed, in Fairyland, while some of the things that here cannot stand still for, a moment, will not move there. So it was not in the least absurd of the, old lady to tell her nephew such things about the golden key.\\n\\nand to be a hollow place so great that she could not tell what it was, hollowed out of. Staring at it, she found that it was a doorway; and, going nearer and staring harder, she saw the door, far in, with a, knocker of iron upon it, a great many yards above her head, and as, large as the anchor of a big ship. Now, nobody had ever been unkind to, Tricksey-Wee, and therefore she was not afraid of anybody. For, Buffy-Bob's box on the ear she did not think worth considering. So, spying a little hole at the bottom of the door which had been nibbled, by some giant mouse, she crept through it, and found herself in an, enormous hall. She could not have seen the other end of it at all\\n\\n\\\"If the lake should disappear, they must find the hole through which, the water ran. But it would be useless to try to stop it by any, ordinary means. There was but one effectual mode.--The body of a living, man could alone stanch the flow. The man must give himself of his own, will; and the lake must take his life as it filled. Otherwise the, offering would be of no avail. If the nation could not provide one, hero, it was time it should perish.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so remarkable were its effects upon her, especially in restoring, her for the time to the ordinary human gravity, that Hum-Drum and, Kopy-Keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three, years; in the hope that, as the water did her so much good, the earth, would do her yet more. But the king had some vulgar prejudices against, the experiment, and would not give his consent. Foiled in this, they, yet agreed in another recommendation; which, seeing that the one, imported his opinions from China and the other from Thibet, was very, remarkable indeed. They argued that, if water of external origin and, application could be so efficacious, water from a deeper source might, work a perfect cure; in short, that if the poor afflicted princess, could by any means be made to cry, she might recover her lost gravity.\\n\\n, Perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in, love. But how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is, a difficulty--perhaps _the_ difficulty. As for her own feelings on the, subject, she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey, and stings to be fallen into. But now I come to mention another curious, fact about her.\\n\\nthis king was justified in forgetting his sister, even at a, christening. She looked very odd, too. Her forehead was as large as all, the rest of her face, and projected over it like a precipice. When she, was angry her little eyes flashed blue. When she hated anybody, they, shone yellow and green. What they looked like when she loved anybody, I, do not know; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself, and I, do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got, used to herself. But what made it highly imprudent in the king to, forget her was--that she was awfully clever. In fact, she was a witch;, and when she bewitched anybody, he very soon had enough of it; for she, beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness, and all the clever ones in, cleverness. She despised all the modes we read of in history, in which, offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges; and therefore\\n\\ngraceful creatures, running up and down the shadow-boles and along the, branches, to disappear in the wind-tossed foliage. As they walked they, waded knee-deep in the lovely lake. For the shadows were not merely, lying on the surface of the ground, but heaped up above it like, substantial forms of darkness, as if they had been cast upon a thousand, different planes of the air. Tangle and Mossy often lifted their heads, and gazed upwards to discry whence the shadows came; but they could see, nothing more than a bright mist spread above them, higher than the tops, of the mountains, which stood clear against it. No forests, no leaves\\n\\nIt began to grow dark. And they wanted more than ever to reach the, country whence the shadows fall. So they looked about them for a way, out of the cave. The door by which Mossy entered had closed again, and, there was half a mile of rock between them and the sea. Neither could, Tangle find the opening in the floor by which the serpent had led her, thither. They searched till it grew so dark that they could see, nothing, and gave it up.\\n\\nIt happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the, brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake. It was a, rocky basin of considerable depth. Looking in, they saw at the bottom, something that shone yellow in the sun. A little boy jumped in and, dived for it. It was a plate of gold covered with writing. They carried, it to the king.\",\n          \"The rain now began to fall, and the wind blew with fitful gusts.  He did, not care for either himself, but he was sorry that Jeannette should be, exposed to the storm.  He felt nearly sure that she would come, in spite, of it.  If not, he made up his mind to wait till dark, and then to go on, to her cottage.  There was no great risk in doing so, as the soldiers, would long before this have given up their search for him and Jack.\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry to say that the authorities have heard of your being in the, neighbourhood, and have sent the gendarmes to search for you!\\\" she, exclaimed, in an anxious tone.  \\\"I did not wish to drive you away, and, am willing to try and conceal you.  At present, no one knows you are in, the house.  You may remain in a loft between the ceiling of this room, and the roof, where you are not likely to be found; but the place is, low, and will, I fear, be hot in the daytime, and far from pleasant., Francois might manage to conduct you to a hut in the woods at no great, distance from this, to which we could send you food; but there is the, risk of the person who goes being seen, and your retreat being, discovered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We got the blanket ready.  The first cloud passed by, nearly saturating, the blanket.  The men wrung it out into one of their hats, two or three, sucking at the corners.  They seemed inclined to fight for the small, quantity they had obtained, but did not even offer to give me any.  I, got no water, though the blanket was somewhat cleansed, not that I felt, inclined to be particular.  In a few minutes another shower fell.  Each, of us got an ample supply of water.  My spirits rose in a way I could, not have expected.  For some time I did not suffer from the pangs of, hunger; but they presently returned with greater force than before, and, I guessed how my companions were feeling.  I encouraged them as well as, I was able.  `God, in His mercy, has sent us water, and He may, I trust\\n\\nThough Commander Saltwell made honourable mention of our hero on each, occasion, he received no further recognition of his services.  \\\"I have, no business to complain,\\\" he observed.  \\\"My position is only that of, many others who have done more than I have, but I should like to be, wearing an epaulette on my right shoulder when we get home, and obtain a, command with you, Oliver, as my first lieutenant.\\\"\\n\\nHe saw no harm in what he was doing; on the contrary, he was serving his, friend Bill as well as himself, or rather his mother, for he wanted the, gold for her.  In the meantime, Bill was hurrying on towards the, Turgots' cottage.  He should astonish them, he knew, by waking them up, in the middle of the night, or rather so early in the morning; but they, would appreciate his desire to wish them good-bye, and would be very, much obliged to him for telling them of the treasure in the cavern.\\n\\nThey soon reached the side of the vessel, and climbed up on deck.  There, was plenty of water alongside to launch the raft, and to get the casks, under it.  The wind, too, if there were any, was off shore, but here it, was a perfect calm.  They had one advantage through having waited so, long; they were beyond the influence of the wave which breaks even on a, weather shore, especially after a gale, although the wind may have, changed.\\n\\nThis was Rayner's first action since he had attained his present rank., He endeavoured to maintain his character, and though it was trying work, to see his shipmates struck down on either side of him, he did not for a, moment think of himself or the risk he ran of meeting the same fate., All the time spars, rigging, and blocks were falling from aloft, shot, away by the hot fire of the enemy.  He endeavoured to keep himself cool, and composed, and to execute the orders he received.\\n\\nJack promised to look after Tom, whom he had not seen since the _Lily_, was paid off.  He returned in a few days, saying that he had long, searched for him in vain, until at length he had found him in a low, house in the lowest of the Plymouth slums, his prize-money, to the, amount of nearly a hundred pounds, all gone, and he himself so drunk, that he could not understand the message Jack brought him.\\n\\nBill, as are many other London boys, was exposed to temptations of all, sorts; often when almost starving, without a roof to sleep under, or a, friend to whom he could appeal for help, his shoes worn out, his, clothing too scanty to keep him warm; but, ever recollecting his, mother's last words, he resisted them all.  One day, having wandered, farther east than he had ever been before, he found himself in the, presence of a press-gang, who were carrying off a party of men and boys, to the river's edge.  One of the man-of-war's men seized upon him, and, Bill, thinking that matters could not be much worse with him than they, were at present, willingly accompanied the party, though he had very, little notion where they were going.  Reaching a boat, they were made to, tumble in, some resisting and endeavouring to get away; but a gentle, prick from the point of a cutlass, or a clout on the head, made them, more reasonable, and most of them sat down resigned to their fate.  One, of them, however, a stout fellow, when the boat had got some distance, from the shore, striking out right and left at the men nearest him\\n\\n\\\"I'm much afraid that he will slip through our fingers unless we can, manage to quell the fever.  He requires constant watching, and that is, more than he can well obtain, with so many men laid up, and so much to, do,\\\" said the doctor as he finished his task.  \\\"However, Rayner, if you, can stay by him, I'll be back in a few minutes to see how he's getting, on.  In the meantime give him this medicine; if he comes to his senses\\n\\nThe cable was accordingly ranged ready to let go at a moment's notice;, but Rayner and Oliver well knew that there was little hope of the anchor, holding, or if it did, of the vessel living through the seas which would, break over her as soon as her course was stopped.  Still, desperate as, was the chance, it must be tried.  There might be time to set the, foresail yet, and she might lay to under it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, go and lie down and take a caulk, if the centipedes and, cockroaches will let you,\\\" laughed Rayner.  \\\"They have been crawling all, over me during the time I have been below, but I knew there was no use, attempting to keep them off, so I let them crawl, without interfering, with their pleasure.  If I see any further change in the appearance of, the sky, I will rouse you up, and we'll make the black fellows turn out, to be ready to shorten sail.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope that things are not so bad as that,\\\" responded Bill.  \\\"I will, try and get you below.  Here!\\\" and he called to one of the prisoners who, had remained on deck, and who, being very glad to get out of the way of, the shot, willingly assisted Bill in dragging the wounded man to the, companion-hatchway, down which the two together lifted him, and placed, him in the gun-room.\\n\\nNot many days after this the senior mate of the _Lily_ was taken very, ill while on shore.  His shipmates declared that it was in consequence, of his chagrin at finding that Rayner had obtained his promotion before, him.  They were heartily sorry at having made so unkind a remark, when, in two days news were received on board that the poor fellow had fallen, a victim to yellow fever.\\n\\nThe crews of the other boats had, in the meantime, gained the deck, but, not before the rest of the Frenchmen came tumbling up from below armed, with cutlasses and pikes, or such weapons as they could lay their hands, on.  Though they made a bold stand, and endeavoured to defend the fore, part of the ship, they had to retreat before the desperate charge of the, boarders, who, with cutlasses flashing and cutting, soon hewed a way for, themselves to the forecastle, leaving the deck on either side covered, with dead or wounded men.  Not a word had been spoken, and scarcely a, shout uttered, but the clashing of steel and flashing of pistols must, have showed the people on shore what was going forward.\\n\\nJack, Tom, and Bill felt very much as a person might be supposed to do, who had dropped from the moon.  Everything around them was so strange, and bewildering, for not one of them had ever before been on board a, ship, and Bill had never even seen one.  Having not been much accustomed, to the appearance of trees, he had some idea that the masts grew out of, the deck, that the yards were branches, and the blocks curious leaves;, not that amid the fearful uproar, and what seemed to him the wildest, confusion, he could think of anything clearly.\\n\\n\\\"I would wish to be with him, but I am anxious to relieve the anxiety of, Madame Turgot and Jeannette, who, if they do not see me, will suppose, that I am lost,\\\" answered the Captain.  \\\"I shall grieve to leave my boy, behind, but I know that he will be well cared for, and I cannot tell, you, my young friend, how grateful I am.  Little did I think, when I, picked you up out of the water, how amply you would return the service I, did you.\\\"\\n\\nwhen, as the light slowly increased, at some little distance off he made, out the dim outline of a large ship.  Whether she was a friend or foe he, could not determine; if the latter, the position of the _Lily_ was, critical in the extreme.  He instantly sent the midshipman of the watch, to arouse the commander, who hurried on deck.  After watching the, stranger for a few seconds, they both came to the conclusion that she, was a frigate, and, as they knew of no English vessel of her class, likely to be thereabouts, that she was French.\\n\\nRayner, however, did not feel very confident that they would obey his, orders, but trusted to his powers as a swimmer to make his way back to, the beach.  A sea rolled in.  He swam on bravely, surmounting its, foaming crest.  He had got to the end of the rope, and Ward was still, beyond his reach.  Still he struggled.  Perhaps another sea might bring, the man to him.  He was not disappointed, and grasping the collar of, Ward's jacket, he shouted to Brown and Tom to haul away; but the sea, which had brought Ward in rolled on, and Tom, fancying that he should be, lifted off his legs, let go the rope and sprang back.  Happily, Brown, held on, but his strength was not sufficient to drag in the rope.  In, vain he called on Tom to come back to his assistance.  While tugging, manfully away, he kept his feet on the ground, although the water rose, above his waist.  The next instant the sea bore Rayner and his now, lifeless burden close up to where he stood.  Rayner himself was almost, exhausted, but with the help of Brown, and such aid as Tom was at, length, from very shame, induced to give, they got beyond the influence, of the angry seas Rayner lost no time in trying to restore the seaman\\n\\nRayner was surprised to hear this, supposing that the captain intended, to pull out to sea, whereas he had resolved to go overland to the part, of the coast which probably the ship in distress was approaching., Although where the frigate lay was tolerably smooth water, yet, from the, white-crested seas which broke outside, and the roaring of the wind as, it swept over the land, it was very evident that no boat could live when, once from under its shelter.\\n\\n\\\"You shall have your necessities supplied, and I will gladly do all I, can to protect and help you regain your ship,\\\" she said.  \\\"I was once, with my daughters taken prisoner when on a voyage from France by an, English ship-of-war, and we were treated by the English officers as if, we had been princesses.  Ah! they were indeed true gentlemen!  They won, our hearts;\\\" and she sighed.  \\\"I thought two of them would have become, husbands of my daughters, but stern duty compelled them to sail away, after they had landed us, and we have never heard of them since.\\\"\\n\\nJack was of the same opinion, and he taking up the basket, they groped, their way to the inner cave round the rock, where it turned, as before, described, to the left.  Here they were completely sheltered from the, wind, and had it not been for the loud roar of the waves beating on the, shore, and the howling of the gale in the outer cavern, they would not, have been aware that a storm was raging outside.\\n\\nJack had done his best to support himself without being a burden to his, mother, who sold fish in the neighbouring town and country round, and, could do very well for herself; so when he proposed going on board a, man-of-war, she, having mended his shirts, bought him a new pair of, shoes, and gave him her blessing.  Accordingly, doing up his spare, clothes in a bundle, which he carried at the end of a stick, he trudged, off with a stout heart, resolved to serve His Majesty and fight the, battles of Old England.\\n\\nThe seamen took but little notice of the new hands, though some of them, had been much of the same description themselves, but were not very fond, of acknowledging this, or of talking of their previous histories; they, had, however, got worked into shape by degrees: and the newcomers, even, those with the \\\"long togs,\\\" by the time they had gone through the same, process would not be distinguished from the older hands, except, maybe\\n\\nThe English sailors now had work enough to do to prevent the Frenchmen, from rising.  While sail was being made, numerous boats also were seen, coming off from the shore full of armed men, evidently with the, intention of attempting to board the prize.  Sail after sail was let, drop, and the ship ran faster and faster through the water.  She was, not, however, as yet entirely won.  Her crew, though beaten down below\\n\\nof being discovered, and it would be very ungrateful to the Turgots to, go away without trying to see them again.  He wished that Jack could, have gone also, but he agreed that it was better for him to remain to do, a few more things to the raft.  Before he started they arranged the, tackles for launching it; and they believed that, when once in the, water, it would not take them more than ten minutes or a quarter of an, hour to haul the empty casks under the bottom and to step and set up the, mast.  They might then, should the wind be favourable, stand boldly out, to sea.\\n\\nthe last.  In those days no questions were asked where men or boys came, from.  At the present time, a boy who should thus appear on board a, man-of-war would find himself in the wrong box, and be quickly sent on, shore again, and home to his friends.  None are allowed to enter the, Navy until they have gone through a regular course of instruction in a, training ship, and none are received on board her unless they can read, and write well, and have a formally signed certificate that they have, obtained permission from their parents or guardians.\\n\\n\\\"Another heavy shower fell during the night, and I roused them up to, obtain a further supply of water.  We filled all our hats, for we had, nothing else to put it in.  The next day was but a repetition of the, former.  The water we had obtained during the night was quickly, exhausted.  My hopes of catching some fish appeared likely to be, disappointed.  Twice a shark came near us, but the brute was too large, to give us a chance of catching it.  It was far more likely to have, caught us had we made the attempt.  We shouted to drive it off.  At, last, smaller fish of some sort approached--albicores or bonitas.  It, was extraordinary with what eager looks we eyed the creatures.\\n\\nkeeping time to the tune.  He had two wooden legs in the shape of, mopsticks, and was supporting himself with a crutch, while with the hand, at liberty he held out a battered hat to receive the contributions of, his audience.  Occasionally, when numbers gathered round to listen to, him, he exchanged his song for a yarn.  As Rayner approached he was, saying, \\\"This is the way our government treats our brave seamen.  Here, was I fighting nobly for my king and country, when a Frenchman's shot, spoilt both my legs, and I was left to stump off as best I could on, these here timber toes without a shiner in my pocket, robbed of all my, hard-earned prize-money.  But you good people will, I know, be kind to, poor Jack, and fill this here hat of his with coppers to give him a, crust of bread and a sup to comfort his old heart.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, some soldiers have been there, and impudent fellows they were;, some of them came to our house, and if my Pierre had been present there, would have been a fight.  I am glad that they have gone.  It is said, they were in search of deserters or spies, and that they had caught one, of them, but could not find the rest.  If monsieur dislikes the military, as much as I do, he'll keep out of their way.\\\"\\n\\nThey were in a short time convinced that their proceedings had produced, the desired effect; for when they ceased to make the noise, they heard, the heavy step of a man ascending the creaking stairs.  It had not, occurred to them that he might possibly come with a thick stick in his, hand, to thrash them for making a row.  The idea, however, flashed, across Jack's mind by the time the man was half-way up.\\n\\n\\\"I was very unfortunate to be on board the _Atlante_ when you captured, her, for I had no wish to fight the English,\\\" said Pierre.  \\\"Only ten, days ago I was persuaded to come on board to see a friend, and the crew, would not let me return on shore.  However, I was determined to make the, best of it, hoping before long to get back to my family, and be able to, assist my father.  And now to be cut down by my own countrymen, for it, was a shot from the battery on shore which wounded me.  It is more than, I can bear!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could do nothing else,\\\" was the answer.  \\\"He was about to place, another man in the cradle who had not the courage to get into it by, himself, when a piece of timber surging up struck both of them, the, other was swept away, and the brave English sailor would have suffered, the same fate had I not got hold of him; and then, though I had made up, my mind to remain to the last, I saw that the only way to save him was, to bring him myself in the cradle to the shore, and I am thankful that I, did so.  But my poor countrymen!  There are many still remaining who, must perish if we cannot get another hawser secured to the wreck.\\\"\\n\\nIt would make their fortunes, and Jeannette would be the richest heiress, in the neighbourhood; for, of course, he would bargain that she should, have a good share.  There might be some difficulty in getting the goods, away without being discovered, which would be a pity, as they were of as, much value as the boxes of gold.  However, he was doing what was right, in giving them the opportunity of possessing themselves of the treasure\\n\\n\\\"Come this way, messieurs!\\\" exclaimed Le Duc, at length.  \\\"This must be, the path Francois told me of.\\\"  He had gone a short distance to the, southward, and now led on, feeling the way with his long stick.  The, others followed.  The path was narrow, and the trees met overhead, so, that they were in complete darkness.  On they went, keeping close behind, each other, for there was no room for two to walk abreast.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant now took his leave, and Mrs Crofton observing that, \\\"Pierre would be the better for some sleep, after the excitement of, being moved,\\\" invited Bill into her sitting-room, she naturally wishing, to hear more about his adventures in France than Mr Saltwell had been, able to tell her.  Bill himself was perfectly willing to talk away on, the subject as long as she wished, especially when he found so ready a, listener in Mary.  He began with an account of the blowing up of the, _Foxhound_; and when he had finished, Mrs Crofton wished to know how it, was that he first came to go to sea, and so he had to go back to tell, her all about himself, and the death of his mother, and how he had been, left penniless in the world.\\n\\nTom did not quite like the remarks he heard.  There was going to be a, sharp fight, of that there could be no doubt, and round shot would soon, be coming in through the sides, and taking off men's heads and legs and, arms.  It struck him that he would have been safer at school.  He, thought of his father and mother, and brothers and sisters, who, if he, was killed, would never know what had become of him; not that Tom was a, coward, but it was somewhat trying to the courage even of older hands\\n\\nprobably, be removed, you may then come back without fear, and resume, the clothes you before wore, and live with us, and help my father and, brother; then who knows what may happen?  You will not have to fight, your own countrymen, and the war may some day come to an end, or perhaps, the French may conquer the English, and then we shall all be very good, friends again.\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning the look-out from the mast-head of the _Lily_ announced, a sail on the lee bow.  In a short time, daylight increasing, she was, seen to be a frigate, and no doubt her late antagonist.  Captain, Saltwell at once bore down on her, making a signal to the prize to do so, likewise, and at the same time running up several signals as if speaking, another ship to windward.\\n\\nThe foretopsail had stood, being a new stout sail, and it being closely, reefed, Rayner hoped that the little vessel would lay to under it.  It, was a dangerous experiment he was about to try, but he had to choose, between two evils--that of being driven on shore, or the risk of having, the decks swept by the tremendous seas rolling up from the southward, before the schooner could be hove-to.  She had already run a, considerable distance nearer the land.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" added Mary, in a sweet voice, with a smile, which made our, hero at once promise that he would lose no opportunity of paying them a, visit.  Rayner's first duty was to see Captain Turgot and Pierre on, board the cartel.  They embraced him with tears in their eyes as they, wished him farewell, and many of the grateful Frenchmen gathered round, him, several expressing their hopes that France and England would soon, make up their quarrel.\\n\\nand it is my belief that they were even then going in search of you., Thoughtless of the consequence, I happened to whistle an air which I, sang that night on board the schooner when we were becalmed.  The rogue, of a black recognised it, for, turning my head, I saw him coming after, me.  I was silent directly, and began to walk very fast.  Fortunately it, was almost dusk, and, reaching some thick bushes, I dodged behind them., The black passed me and went on.  I lay quiet, and after a time he came, back, and I heard him tell the soldiers, who had followed him, that he, must have been mistaken; so they then proposed going back to the, village.\\n\\nSoon after noon the wind fell, and the _Lily_ lay motionless on the, glassy ocean; the sun shining forth with intense heat, making the pitch, in the seams of the deck bubble up, and every piece of metal feel as if, it had just come out of a furnace.  The seamen sought every spot of, shade which the sails afforded, and made frequent visits to the, water-cask to quench their thirst.\\n\\n\\\"It's all arranged, messieurs,\\\" he said.  \\\"There's an old lady and two, young ladies in the house.  I told them all about you, when they said, that they were fond of the English, and would be very happy to give you, shelter and food, but that you must come quietly so that no one but, their old brown maitre d'hotel, and black girls who wait on them, should, know that you are in the house.  Follow me, then, and just have the, goodness to tell the men that they must behave themselves or they may be, getting into trouble.\\\"\\n\\nJust then, however, the survivors were too much occupied to think about, the matter; every man and boy was wanted to get the ship to rights, and, all were eagerly looking out for a breeze that they might again attack, the enemy.  Bill was as eager as any one for the fight.  He felt that he, was somebody, as he could not help reflecting that he had done good, service in saving the life of the first lieutenant, though he did not, exactly expect any reward in consequence.  It seemed to him that he had, grown suddenly from a powder monkey into a man.  Still the calm, continued, and the two ships lay with their sails against the masts, the, water shining like a polished mirror.\\n\\nThe first plunge the colonel made with his hand into one of Jack's, pockets brought forth a number of gold pieces.  \\\"Hurroo! now, this is, your innocence is it, young gintlemen?\\\" he exclaimed, exhibiting a, handful of gold to the general.  \\\"Let me be afther seeing what your, other pocket contains;\\\" and as he spoke he quickly drew forth another, handful of gold, some of which, observing that the general and the other, officers were examining the first which he had produced, he slipped into, his own pocket.\\n\\nThus the night passed away.  The breeze slightly increased, but Bill, considered that they might still carry their whole sail with safety., Perhaps they did not move along quite so fast as he supposed.  He told, Jack that he thought they were running through the water at five knots, an hour; but four, or even three, knots was a good deal for a raft to, make, with flat bows, light and well put together as it was.\\n\\nThe wind being very light, every stitch of canvas the _Thisbe_ could, carry was packed on her, and her course altered so as to cut off the, stranger.  As the sun rose, and its beams lighted up the white canvas of, the latter, she was pronounced to be a full-rigged ship, either a, man-of-war or privateer, or a large merchantman, but at the distance she, was off it was difficult to determine whether she was a frigate or a, flush-decked vessel.  Captain Martin hoped that she would prove to be a, frigate, and an antagonist worthy of engaging.  She must have seen the, _Thisbe_ approaching, but either took her for a friend or believed that, she was well able to cope with her, as she did not alter her course., Captain Martin calculated that the _Thisbe_ would be up with the, stranger before noon.  Every telescope on board was directed towards, her.  Bill wished that he had one, that he might form an opinion as to, what she was.  He heard some officers talking, and they declared that, she was undoubtedly French, and was either a large man-of-war corvette\\n\\nhowever, was not easily to be accomplished.  When the officers went to, the window, they found that Jack and his companions had made little, progress.  The bars fitted so closely into the holes that there was but, a small quantity of lead, and without a hammer and chisel it seemed, impossible to make the hole sufficiently large to move the bars so as to, allow Brown to exert his strength upon them.  If the two centre, perpendicular bars could be got out, the lowest horizontal bar might be, sent up.  This would afford ample room for the stoutest of the party to, get through.\\n\\n\\\"When they discovered that you were English, the officers took a fearful, oath that nothing should compel them to yield.  They, however, did their, best to escape; but when they found that you had the heels of them, they, made up their minds to fight, fully expecting, I believe, to take you., Nothing could exceed the savageness of the crew as, stripped to the, waist, they went to their guns.  Several of them, as they cast their, eyes on me, vowed that they would shoot me through the head should the, day go against them.  Having no fancy to be so treated, I thought it, prudent to go below, knowing very well that, in spite of their boasting\\n\\nThey husbanded their food, but it was rapidly diminishing.  At night, they therefore, when the tide had gone out, crept down on the sands, and, managed to cut off some limpets and other shell-fish with their knives, from the rocks.  These would have sustained them for some days had they, been able to cook them, but they had no means of lighting a fire., Though limpets may help to keep body and soul together for a short time\\n\\n\\\"I remember well how you behaved on board the _Foxhound_, and I want you, to keep a watch on the prisoners, and let me know if you hear or see, anything suspicious.  They will probably remain quiet enough, as they, must know that they would have very little chance of success should they, attempt to rise upon us.  At the same time it is better to be on the, safe side, and not to trust them too much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would not be the truth, and we should not be believed,\\\" answered, Bill.  \\\"I would say just what happened--that our ship caught fire and, blew up, that we were saved by the fishermen, that some French soldiers, got hold of us and carried us off prisoners, and that we made our escape, from them.  We need not mention the names of our friends, and perhaps, the interpreter won't be very particular in making inquiries.\\\"\\n\\nordered the _Thisbe's_ helm to be put to port; at the same moment, her, starboard broadside being fired, the shot raked the two Frenchmen fore, and aft.  The helm was then immediately put over, and the frigate coming, up on the other tack, her larboard broadside was poured into her, antagonists.  The shot told with considerable effect.  The foretopmast, of the leading frigate was shot away, and the mizenmast of the one, following was seen to go by the board.  This, however, did not much, alter their rate of sailing, as, the wind being aft, all the canvas they, required continued set.  They also opened their fire, and their shot, came crashing on board the _Thisbe_, killing and wounding two or three, men, but not doing any material damage to her spars or rigging.  She, having shortened sail, her antagonists were compelled to do the same;, and while they poured their broadsides into her, she returned them as, rapidly as the crew could run the guns in and out.\\n\\nThe morning wore on, the hands were piped down to dinner, the prospect, of hot work not at all damping their appetites, though perhaps they got, through their meal rather faster than was their wont; when they again, hurried on deck to see how things were going on.  The two French, frigates were approaching.  The headmost in a short time fired a, bowchaser, but the shot fell short.  It served, however, as a signal to, prepare for action.  Once more the guns were cast loose, and their crews, stood ready to fire as soon as they received the looked-for word of, command.\\n\\nAt last Bill and Jeannette persuaded them that there really was such a, cave; but on considering the hour, they came to the conclusion that the, tide would come in before they could make their escape from it, and they, would prefer going when the tide had again made out.  Bill, they, thought, would only just have time to get on board the vessel, if he was, determined to go.\\n\\n\\\"She hasn't come up with us yet,\\\" answered Bill.  \\\"We shall have time to, beat off the others and stand away to the northward before she gets us, within range of her guns.  Perhaps, too, the wind will shift to the, eastward, and throw her to leeward.  We shall then be well in with, Plymouth by the time she can manage to beat up to us.  We are not going, to give in while the tight little frigate keeps above water.\\\"\\n\\nThe wind, which had been moderate when the action began, had now greatly, increased.  Not a moment was lost in commencing the repair of damages., The sky indicated the approach of bad weather, and a westerly or, south-westerly gale might be expected.  Before all the shot-holes could, be stopped it came on to blow very hard.  Plymouth being too far to the, westward, the nearest shelter the _Thisbe_ could reach was Portland\\n\\nAnother attempt was made.  The main-trysail was shifted to the foremast;, if that would stand, the vessel might possibly be kept off shore; but, scarcely had it been set, than the hurricane came down on the hapless, vessel with redoubled fury.  The weather rigging gave way, and down came, the mast itself, killing one of the blacks, and fearfully crushing, another; and, to Rayner's dismay striking down Jack Peek.  He sprang, forward to drag Jack out from beneath the tangled rigging and spars\\n\\n\\\"Mais, ma foi! those poltroons who ran off, afraid that the sea would, swallow them up, should be ashamed of themselves,\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"You, had best show your gratitude, my friend, by getting them to assist us in, bringing off my brother officer and the seaman from the wreck,\\\" answered, Rayner.  \\\"I fear that she will not hold together many hours, and unless, they are soon rescued they may lose their lives.\\\"\\n\\nOliver and Jack, who were at the helm, as they put it down prepared to, lash it to starboard; but as the vessel came up to the wind, a fearful, sea struck her, sweeping over her deck, carrying away the caboose and, the whole of the bulwarks forward; at the same moment the foretopsail, split as the other had done, and the canvas, after fluttering wildly in, the blast, was whisked round and round the yard.\\n\\n\\\"What it's all about, ma foi, is more than I or any of us can tell,\\\", exclaimed a boatswain's mate, wringing Rayner's hand, which all were, eager to grasp.  \\\"We are carried on board ship and told to fight, and so, we fight--more fools we!  If we were wise, we should navigate our, merchant vessels, or go fishing, or stay at home and cultivate our, fields and gardens.  We all hope that there'll be peace when we next, meet, messieurs.\\\"\\n\\nThe western shore was reached at last.  As they approached the cliffs, they saw a number of people moving about, and as they got to the bay and, looked down over the foaming ocean, they could see a dark object some, fifty fathoms off, from which proceeded piercing shrieks and cries for, help.  It was the hull of a large ship, hove on her beam-ends, her masts, gone, the after-part already shattered and rent by the fierce seas which, dashed furiously against her, threatening to sweep off the miserable, wretches clinging to the bulwarks and stanchions.  To form a, communication with her was Captain Martin's first object.  As yet it was, evident that no attempt of the sort had been made, most of the people, who had collected being more eager apparently to secure the casks\\n\\n\\\"Dear Tom,--Our father received yours of the third instant, as the first, intimation of your being alive since your unaccountable disappearance., You have caused us by your wicked proceeding no end of grief and, trouble, and, as far as we can make out by your wretchedly written, epistle, you do not seem to be at all ashamed of yourself, or sorry for, what you have done; and our father bids me to say, that as you have made, your bed, you must lie in it.  As to making you an allowance of thirty, or forty pounds a year, and getting you placed on the quarter-deck, the, notion is too ridiculous to be entertained.  I must tell you, too, our, father has failed, smashed up completely, won't pay sixpence in the, pound.  As we find it a hard matter to live, he is not likely to make, you an allowance of thirty pounds, or thirty pence a year, or to trouble, himself by going to the Admiralty with the certainty of being sent away, with a flea in his ear; so you see, Tom, you must just grin and bear it., If you don't get killed, I would advise you--should you ever wish to, come home--to make your appearance with your pockets full of the, prize-money you talk of, and you will then perhaps receive a welcome\\n\\ndetermined to let them escape.  He had already three hundred and forty, prisoners on board, while his own crew amounted to only one hundred and, ninety.  Should he take another prize, he would have still further to, diminish the number of the ship's company, while that of the prisoners, would be greatly increased.  The French and American captains had come, on deck, and were standing apart, watching the distant vessels.\\n\\n\\\"We must try to pick up some shell-fish from the rocks,\\\" answered Bill., \\\"The soldiers by that time will have got tired of looking for us, and if, any persons from the top of the cliffs see us they won't know who we, are, and will fancy we are fisher-boys getting bait.  Perhaps before, that time a smuggling lugger may come off here, and we may manage to, hail her before we run short of food; at all events, there's no use, being frightened about what may happen.\\\"\\n\\nIn this book three boys join up in the same batch.  They have the usual, Kingston-style adventures, but only one of them makes it to the quarter, deck to become a midshipman.  This was probably the hardest step for any, of them, but it was his bravery, honesty and good manners that won for, him the necessary attention.  At the end of the book there is a pathetic, scene where we meet again the boy who did least well.  This is a good, and enjoyable read or listen, taking about twelve and three quarter, hours.\\n\\ncaptured by an English man-of-war; that she had been driven by the, hurricane on the reef, and that it was their belief the English officers, and crew had escaped as well as themselves, but they could not tell what, had become of them.  The mayor, on hearing this, had despatched a party, of gendarmes in search of the missing people.  How soon they may be here, it is impossible to say.\\\"\\n\\nThe master, some time before, had brought up a chart on deck, and now, pointed out to his brother officers the exact spot towards which the, ship was steering.  It was the Bay of Rosas.  Already the ship was, entering between two capes which formed its northern and southern sides., The captain stood in the midst of his officers and men, gathered on, deck, for every place below was filled with smoke, and, except in the, after-part of the ship, the raging flames had gained full mastery.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, Pierre entered the house.  His joy at seeing, his father almost overcame him.  They threw themselves into each other's, arms and embraced as Frenchmen are accustomed to embrace--somewhat, it, must be confessed, to Mary's amusement.  After they had become more, tranquil they sat down and talked away at such a rate that even Rayner, could scarcely understand what they were saying.  He meantime had a, pleasant conversation with Mary and her mother, for he had plenty to, tell them, and they evidently liked to listen to him.\\n\\nThe greatest efforts were now made to set up the jury-masts.  The wind, was increasing, and the sea rising every minute.  The day also was, drawing on, and matters were getting worse and worse; still Captain, Waring and his staunch crew worked away undaunted.  If they could once, get up the jury-masts, a course might be steered either for the Isle of, Wight or Plymouth.  Sails had been got up from below; the masts were, ready to raise, when there came a cry of, \\\"The enemy is standing towards, us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw soon afterwards two others floating at some distance from the, raft.  One of them shouted for help saying that he was exhausted, and, could no longer support himself.  The other, notwithstanding left him to, his fate and swam towards us.  I could not bear to see the poor fellow, perish in our sight with the possibility of saving him, and as there was, no time to be lost, I plunged in and made for him, picking up in my way, a piece of plank.  I placed it under his arms, and telling him to hold, on to it, shoved it before me in the direction of the raft.  The other, fellow had in the meantime got hold of a piece of timber, on which he, was resting, but was apparently almost exhausted.  As I passed, I told, him that if I could I would come to his help, and I at length managed to, get back to the raft, on to which the three other men had hauled up, their other shipmate.\\n\\nTheir plan was to form an oblong square, then to put on bows at one end;, and two pieces crossing each other with a short upright between them, on, which to support the steering oar.  The interior of the framework they, strengthened by two diagonal braces.  They lashed and nailed a number of, crosspieces close together, and on the top of the whole they nailed down, all the planks they could find, which were sufficient to form a good, flooring to their raft.\\n\\nOnce more the boys got their oars out, and laboured away as, energetically as before.  They every now and then, however, looked back, to ascertain if the boat were coming after them.  Meantime a light, breeze played occasionally over the water, but it was so light that it, would not have helped them much, and they thought it wiser not to hoist, their sail, as it would betray their position should a French boat, really be in pursuit of them.\\n\\nThe lieutenant of marines quickly turned out his men, while the, boatswain roused up the most trustworthy of the seamen.  So quickly and, silently all was done, that a strong body of officers and men well armed, were collected on the quarter-deck before any of the prisoners were, aware of what was going forward.  They were awaiting the captain's, orders, when a loud report was heard.  A thick volume of smoke ascended, from below, and the next instant, with loud cries and shouts, a number, of the prisoners were seen springing up the hatchway ladders.\\n\\n\\\"Hurrah! thanks to that shot, we may make our escape out of this, for, the Frenchmen are too much engaged at the guns to see us!\\\" cried Jack., \\\"Let us get down to the shore, and when we are once there we may manage, to find our way aboard the ship.  The chances are we shall find some, fishing boat or other on the beach.  May we try, sir, what we can do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know our men, and can answer for their doing their duty,\\\" replied Mr, Saltwell, with confidence.  \\\"If we delay getting out the boats, we may, find it impossible to do so at last, and the lives of all on board may, be sacrificed.  We can trust to the marines, and give them directions to, prevent any of the men getting into the boats until you issue the order, for them to do so.\\\"\\n\\nThe commanders of the two ships were received by the captain in his, cabin, while the gun-room officers invited those of similar rank to mess, with them, the men taking care of the French and American crews.  The, British seamen treated them rather as guests than prisoners, being ready, to attend to their wants and to do them any service in their power., Their manner towards the Frenchmen showed the compassion they felt\\n\\nSummoning the gunner and the boatswain, the first lieutenant ordered the, former to open the ports, to give light and air below, and the latter to, pipe up the hammocks.  He then ascended to the orlop deck, made his way, first into one tier, then into another, in both of which he found the, smoke issuing exceedingly thick from forward.  He was now joined by the, second lieutenant and Rayner.\\n\\n\\\"I sat up, hoping against hope that you might come back to ascertain if, any people had escaped, or that some other vessel might pass within, hail.  We had no means of making a signal, not even a spar on which to, hoist our handkerchiefs or shirts.  The only article which had by some, means or other been thrown on the raft was a blanket.  How it had fallen, there I cannot tell.  I secured it, and doubling it up, it served as a, rest to my head.  I constantly, however, got up to look about, but no, vessel could I see, and at length, overpowered by weariness, I lay down, and fell asleep.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want to see your wives and families again?\\\" he asked.  \\\"Look, there!  How smooth the water is ahead.  The wind is falling, and the, frigate will soon be becalmed.  She'll not think it worth while to send, her boats after us.  Come! out with the sweeps, and we shall soon draw, out of shot of her.  Look there! now her topsails are already flapping, against the masts.  Be of good courage, my sons!\\\"\\n\\nHe grasped it with both his hands, and eagerly drank the contents.  A, second mug had in the meantime been filled.  One of the Frenchmen, in, his eagerness to reach it, stretched out his arms, and fell flat on his, face.  The English seamen lifted him up, and gently poured the water, down his throat.  He and two more were lifted on board.  They then took, a cup to the rest, who were too weak to make the slightest exertion., They poured some water down the throat of one; he gave one gasp, and, then sank back, apparently lifeless.  A sixth person was already beyond, human help.  On raising his arm, it fell again at his side.\\n\\nwith others who had hurried from below, fully believed that the enemy, had hauled down her flag, but instead of that, under all the sail she, could carry, she continued standing away until she had got two miles, off.  Here she hove-to, in order, it was evident, to repair damages., These must have been very severe, for many of her men were seen over the, sides engaged in stopping shot-holes, while the water, which issued, forth in cascades, showed that the pumps were being worked with might, and main to keep her from sinking.\\n\\nBill's mother was buried in a rough shell by the parish, and Bill went, out into the world to seek his fortune.  He took to curious ways,--, hunting in dust-heaps for anything worth having; running errands when he, could get any one to send him; holding horses for gentlemen, but that, was not often; doing duty as a link-boy at houses when grand parties, were going forward or during foggy weather; for Bill, though he often, went supperless to his nest, either under a market-cart, or in a cask by, the river side, or in some other out-of-the-way place, generally managed, to have a little capital with which to buy a link; but the said capital, did not grow much, for bad times coming swallowed it all up.\\n\\n\\\"There's no chance of your getting back for the present, but I hope you, will see your mother and sister notwithstanding,\\\" answered Bill.  \\\"We, are running across the Channel, and shall be in an English port in a day, or two, when you will be landed, and I will ask the captain to let me, take care of you.  I should like to prove how grateful I am for all your, kindness to me and Jack Peek, and I will tell Mr Saltwell, the, lieutenant who commands this ship, how you and your family treated me., But I don't think you ought to talk; I came to see if I could do, anything for you.\\\"\\n\\nBill drew his head in from the window, and beckoned to Jack, who, followed him up; and as there was no time to be lost, he at once dropped, down on to the top of the wall.  Jack came next, fortunately without, dislodging any stones, which might have rattled down and betrayed their, proceedings.  Bill leading, they made their way on hands and knees along, the top of the wall, which, being fringed in most places with bushes\\n\\nAll the canvas they could carry was set.  In a short time one of the, strangers was seen to haul up to the northward, and the _Lily_ was, ordered to go in pursuit of her.  She was apparently the smallest of the, three, but was still likely to prove no mean antagonist.  As the _Lily_, appeared to be gaining on her, the commander gave the order to prepare, for action.  The frigate meantime was standing after the other two, vessels.  Before long her topsails, and finally her royals, disappeared, beneath the horizon.\\n\\nHe climbed up to it, and gazed out.  Great was his satisfaction to, perceive the top of a massive wall a few feet below him.  The tower had, been a portion of an old castle, and the end of this wall was a mass of, ruins, but quite thick enough to enable them to scramble along the top, of it, and Bill had no doubt that they thence could easily descend to\\n\\n\\\"I've no very clear notion about the matter,\\\" he answered; \\\"I must have, been in the water, for I found myself lying at the bottom of a boat wet, to the skin, and more dead than alive.  There were a dozen or more of, our fellows in her, and Mr Saltwell, our first lieutenant, who had been, picked up, I supposed, as I had been.  They thought I was done for, and\\n\\nThere were two small chests placed on the top of the others.  They were, strongly secured; but by means of a sharp stone, which served as a, chisel, and another as a hammer, they managed to break one of them open., What was their surprise to find the case full of gold pieces!  They had, little doubt that the other also contained money.  They, neither of, them, had ever seen so much gold before.\\n\\nThe country, from the glimpse they had had of it, appeared more inviting, to the west, but Rayner reflected that by going in that direction they, would get farther and farther from the Spanish territory, but were they, once to reach it, they might claim assistance from the inhabitants.  How, many miles they were from the border neither Rayner nor Oliver was, certain; it might be a dozen or it might be twenty or thirty.  Le Duc, could give them no information.  It was difficult to find the way in the, darkness; they could indeed only guide themselves by listening to the, roar of the breakers, with an occasional glimpse of the dark ocean to, the right.  The two officers agreed that it would be of great advantage, to get into Spanish territory before daylight, as they would thus avoid, being taken prisoners.  Though their object in coming on the coast was a, peaceable one, it would be difficult to induce the authorities to, believe that this was the case.  Le Duc promised that he would bear, testimony to the truth of the account they intended to give of, themselves; but, he observed, \\\"My word may not be believed, and I myself, may be accused of being a deserter.  The people hereabouts do not set, much value on human life, and they may shoot us all to save themselves, the trouble of making further inquiries.\\\"\\n\\nNews of the battered state of the _Thisbe_ having been received at the, Admiralty, a frigate was ordered round to escort her into port, as she, was not in a position to put to sea safely by herself.  The Frenchmen, having been received on board the two frigates, and a light northerly, breeze springing up, they sailed together for Plymouth.  The pumps were, kept going on board the _Thisbe_ during the whole passage, when the, Frenchmen, at the instigation of Captain Turgot, volunteered to work, them.\\n\\n\\\"My lads!\\\" he said, \\\"some of you have fought under me before now, and, though the odds were against us, we licked the enemy.  We have got, somewhat greater odds, perhaps, at present, but I want to take two or, three of those ships; they are not quite as powerful as they look, and, if you will work your guns as I know you can work them, we'll do it, before many hours have passed.  We have a fine breeze to help us, and, will tackle one after the other.  You'll support me, I know.\\\"\\n\\nThe Frenchmen, however, fought bravely, and evidently did not intend to, let him get off if they could help it.  Each had just fired another, broadside into the _Thisbe_, when they were seen to haul their wind, the, two ships coming up astern doing the same.  The reason of this was, evident: the line-of-battle ship to the westward, now approaching under, a pressure of sail, had hoisted British colours, and any longer delay, would have enabled her quickly to capture one or both of them.  The, brave crew of the _Thisbe_ expressed their satisfaction by giving a loud, cheer, which was joined in even by many of the wounded.\\n\\nThe rope held, however, though, as he felt it, it appeared stretched to, the utmost.  He could with difficulty draw a breath, while he waited, till, by finding the rope slacken, he should know that Bill had safely, reached the bottom.  At last he ascertained that Bill was no longer, hanging to the rope, while, from not hearing a sound, he was sure that, his companion had performed the feat in safety.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" she answered.  \\\"I was delayed, or I should have set off, earlier, but a party of soldiers came to the village pretending that, they wanted to buy fish.  I, however, suspected that they came to look, for you, and I waited till they had gone away again.  We sold them all, the fish they asked for, and put on an unconcerned look, as if, suspecting nothing, I saw them, however, prying about, and I recognised, one of them as the sergeant who came in command of the party which, carried you off.  I am not at all certain, either, that they will not, return, and I should not have ventured out, had I not known that you, must be greatly in want of food, and that, perhaps, should the storm, which is now beginning increase, many days might pass before I could, supply you.\\\"\\n\\nIt of course occurred to Rayner that if Oliver could manage to float a, cask, or even a piece of plank secured to the end of a rope, a, communication might be established between the wreck and the shore; but, as far as he could see, the running rigging and all the ropes had gone, overboard with the masts, and the only coil saved was that which had, been brought in the boat.\\n\\nIn another second or two the other forts followed suit.  The whole, atmosphere was filled with a dense black cloud and masses of lurid flame, beneath, while thundering reports in rapid succession rent the air.  A, few seconds afterwards down came showers of stone and earth and pieces, of burning timber, just astern of the boats.  Had there been any delay, they must have been overwhelmed.  Fortunately they all escaped injury\\n\\nWe might give not a few instances of more recent date, but the families, and friends of those \\\"who have risen\\\" do not always feel the same honest, pride as the great men themselves in the story of their life.  While it, is true that no sailor boy may now hope to become \\\"Admiral of the, Fleet,\\\" yet there is room for advancement, in peace as in war, to what, is better than mere rank or title or wealth,--a position of honour and, usefulness.  Good character and good conduct, pluck and patience\\n\\n\\\"We should have to get food first, even if we did run off with a boat,\\\", observed Bill.  \\\"It would never do to put to sea without something to, eat.  I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll try and make my way back to, Captain Turgot's.  It cannot be far from this.  I'll ask them to give us, some food.  They are sure to do that, though they might not like hiding, us; and perhaps they might tell us of some boat in which we could get, off without the owner being the worse for the loss.  If you'll stay, here, I'll go this very evening as soon as the tide is out.  I calculate, that I should have time to get there and back before the flood is up;, and I'm not afraid of being refused, at all events.\\\"  Jack wanted to go, too; but Bill urged that one was less likely to be discovered than two\\n\\nchests, and other things thrown on shore than to assist their perishing, fellow-creatures.  It was vain to shout and direct the people on the, wreck to attach a line to a cask and let it float in towards the beach., The most stentorian voices could not make themselves heard when sent in, the teeth of the gale now blowing.  On descending the cliffs, Captain, Martin and his party found a narrow strip of beach, on which they could, stand out of the power of the seas, which, in quick succession, came, foaming and roaring in towards them.  He immediately ordered a couple of, rockets to be let off, to show the strangers that there were those on, shore who were ready to help them.  No signal was fired in return, not, even a lantern shown, but the crashing, rending sounds which came from, the wreck made it too evident that she could not much longer withstand, the furious assaults of the raging ocean.  Captain Martin inquired, whether any of his crew were sufficiently good swimmers to reach the, wreck.\\n\\nwith straining eyes, they gazed at the land.  On either side a dark mass, of smoke ascended before them, and blew away to leeward, while the lurid, flames rose beneath it, striving furiously for victory over the masts, and spars, sails and rigging.  It seemed like a miracle that the masts, should stand in the midst of the hot furnace which glowed far down the, depths of the ship.  All were aware that at any moment one of several, fearful events might occur.  The wind might shift and prevent the ship, reaching the land ahead, or a gale might spring up and cast the ship, helplessly upon the rocks, or a calm might come on and delay her, progress, or the masts, burnt through, might fall and crush those on, deck, or, still more dreadful, a spark might reach the magazine, and her, immediate destruction must follow.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, what language is that?\\\" exclaimed the sergeant, holding up his, lantern and examining the sailor's countenance.  \\\"You are not a, Frenchman, I'll vow.\\\"  He turned from one to the other, looking in the, faces of each.  \\\"Why, I believe these are the very men we were ordered, to search for.  Seize them all.  Take care that none escape.  There are, five of them, the very number we were told of, and one, the traitor, we, have already got.  Can any of you speak French? though I doubt it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They'll have a tough job, sir, let me tell them,\\\" observed Bill.  \\\"I, haven't seen much of English sojers except the Guards in London, and our, Marines on board ship, but I know that one of our Guardsmen would lick a, whole tentful of the little chaps I see about here; and I would advise, the general to stay quietly at home, and not attempt to take our tight, little island.\\\"\\n\\nThe midshipmen had finished theirs, and Rayner, who had just relieved, one of his messmates on deck, was on the look-out when he espied, away, on the larboard bow, a sail through the fog, which had somewhat, dispersed in that quarter.  A second glance convinced him that she was a, large ship.  He instantly shouted out the welcome intelligence.  Every, one hoped that she was the vessel they were in search of.  The drum beat, to quarters, and scarcely were the guns run out than the fog clearing, still more discovered a large frigate standing under all sail to the, eastward, about half a mile away.  If she were the one they had before, seen, she had evidently acted as Captain Martin had supposed might be, the case, and having crossed the _Thisbe's_ course, had then kept away\\n\\n\\\"We ought to be thankful that we are in so snug a place,\\\" observed Bill;, \\\"but I tell you, we must take care not to eat up all our food in a, hurry, or we may find it a hard matter to get more.  The wind appears to, have driven the sea over on this shore, and I doubt whether we shall be, able to make our way along the beach even at low water.\\\"\\n\\nRayner, observing that the surf did not roll up the beach to any, considerable height, looked out for a passage through which the vessel, might be steered.  The continuous line of breakers ran as far as the eye, could reach along the shore.  There was only one spot where they seemed, to break with less fury.  Towards it Rayner determined to steer the, schooner.  He and Oliver soon came to the conclusion that it would be, useless to attempt anchoring.  The water, probably, was far too deep, outside the reef for their range of cable, and even if it were not, the, anchor was not likely to hold.\\n\\n\\\"Well! if it is a ghost it won't hurt us,\\\" answered Bill; \\\"but the only, ghosts hereabouts are those curious figures, which can't move from their, places.  For my part, I don't believe there are such things as ghosts at, all going about to frighten people.  The only one I ever heard tell of, was `The Cock Lane Ghost', and that was found out to be a sham long, ago.\\\"\\n\\nJack and Bill made themselves very useful in hauling the nets, and, cleaning the fish when caught.  Jack was well up to the work, and showed, Bill how to do it.  Captain Turgot was highly pleased, and called them, \\\"bons garcons,\\\" and said he hoped that they would remain with him till, the war was over, and as much longer as they liked.  When the cutter, returned into the harbour to land her fish, Jack and Bill were sent, below, so that the authorities might not see them and carry them off., Captain Turgot was much afraid of losing them.  They were getting on, famously with their French, and Bill could chatter away already at a, great rate, though not in very good French, to be sure, for he made a, number of blunders, which afforded constant amusement to his companions\\n\\nIt was Oliver's duty to go on board and take possession of the prize., Unwillingly he left his friend's side.  Of the _Lily's_ crew five had, been killed, and many more beside her commander, wounded.  But Oliver, saw, as he stepped on board the prize, how much more severely she had, suffered.  Everywhere lay dead and dying men.  How dread and terrible a, fact is war!  A lieutenant, coming forward, presented his sword.\\n\\nBill felt a strong inclination to follow the advice given him.  One of, the men, bundling up his wet clothes, carried them to dry at the little, galley fire forward.  The rest went on deck, and Bill in another minute, fell fast asleep.  Where the cutter was going Bill could not tell.  He, had known her to be a fishing-vessel by seeing the nets on deck, and he, had guessed that she was French by the way in which the people on board, had spoken.  They had given evidence also that they intended to treat, him kindly.\\n\\nHe went up on deck, hoping that the man who had spoken a few words of, English might be able to tell him how Jack had been picked up.  On, reaching the deck he found that the vessel was close in with the land., She was towing a shattered gig, which Bill recognised as one of those, belonging to the _Foxhound_.  He at once conjectured that Jack had, managed somehow or other to get into her.\\n\\nThis done, they jumped into their respective beds, and when once there, they agreed that, if they were not so hungry, they would infinitely, prefer going to sleep to having to get up again and make themselves, agreeable to the ladies.  As soon as Francois got possession of their, clothes he hurried away, but shortly returned, bringing with him a, supply of linen and silk stockings, and two antiquated court suits., They were, he said, the only costumes which he considered worthy of the, English officers, and he begged that they would put them on without, ceremony.\\n\\nThe sun was by this time sinking towards the west; and should darkness, come on, their chances of escape would be increased.  The wind had, shifted slightly to the south-west, and should it freshen sufficiently, to make it worth while hoisting the sail, they might stand away to the, north-east.  It still, however, wanted two or three hours before it, would be perfectly dark, while the boat would be up to them before that, time.  After rowing for the greater part of an hour, Jack again took a, look-out, and reported that he could distinctly see the boat.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I was right,\\\" said Jack, coming down.  \\\"I made out a boat, as sure, as we are here, and a large one, too, or I should not have seen her so, clearly.  She's a good way off still, so that it will be some time, before she can get up with us.  The French fellows in her must take, yonder ship to be a countryman, or they would not pull on so boldly.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, having closed the door, they got up seven of the steps, beginning, at the uppermost one, till they formed a gap which it would be, impossible for a man to spring over.  The boards they carried down as, they descended, when they found themselves in another storey, the whole, of which was occupied by one large room without doors, the reason, of, course, why it had not been made their prison.\\n\\nThe two ships, with the flags of the commanders on each side, were now, engaged at close quarters, yard-arm and yard-arm, and completely, enveloped in smoke.  This proved favourable to the purpose of the brave, youth, who mounted the shrouds through the smoke unobserved, gained the, French Admiral's main-yard, ascended with agility to the main-topgallant, mast-head, and carried off the French flag.  It was soon seen that the, enemy's colours had disappeared, and the British sailors, thinking they, had been hauled down, raised a shout of \\\"Victory, victory!\\\"  The French, were thrown into confusion by this, and first slackened fire, and then, ran from their guns.  At this juncture the ship was boarded by the, English and taken.  Hopson had by this time descended the shrouds with, the French flag wrapped round his arm, which he triumphantly displayed.\\n\\nCaptain Martin, on seeing this, sent Rayner below with orders to double, shot the after-maindeck guns, and to fire them as the enemy came close, up.  The next he shouted the cry which British seamen are always ready, to obey, \\\"Boarders, repel boarders;\\\" and every man not engaged at the, guns hurried aft, cutlass in hand, ready to drive back the foe as soon, as the ships should touch; but ere that moment arrived, an iron shower, issued from the guns beneath their feet, crashing through the, Frenchman's bows and tearing along her decks.  Instead of coming on, she, suddenly threw all her sails aback, and hauled off out of gunshot.  On, seeing this, the British crew uttered three hearty cheers, and Rayner\\n\\nJack regained his courage as they approached the fire, and both being, pretty well tired, they were glad to sit down and talk about the, wonderful store of goods they had discovered.  Jack was afraid that the, owners might come back to look for their property and discover them, but, Bill was of opinion that they had been placed there by a party of, smugglers, who had gone away and been lost without telling any one where, they had stowed their goods.\\n\\nThe moment for action was approaching.  The ship was seen at the spot, where Bill thought she would be found, lying silent and dark, her tall, masts and the tracery of her rigging just to be distinguished against, the sky.  No one was observed moving on her deck.  Eagerly the boats, dashed forward to the posts allotted to them.  The bows of the barge had, just hooked on when the sentry on the gangway, who had evidently not, been attending to his duty, shouted out, and fired his musket.\\n\\n\\\"I have been thinking too much about going away to feel hungry,\\\" said, Bill.  \\\"But now you talk of it, I should like some food, and I hope, they'll bring enough to last us for a day or two.  Now, I say, it's, getting dark, and we must fix upon the best spot to lower ourselves down, to.  You listen at the door lest any one should come up suddenly, and, I'll examine the windows and settle the best plan.\\\"\\n\\nAs Oliver, who went first, had just got to the top, his attention was, attracted by loud shouts coming from the rear of the fort.  Above them, quickly rose a hearty British cheer.  Showers of bullets came flying, through the air.  The shouts and cries increased.  Amid the clash of, steel, and the sharp crack of pistols, the voices of the officers, reached him calling the men to abandon the guns and defend the fort., But it was too late.  Already a strong party of blue-jackets and marines, were inside.\\n\\n\\\"Well, lads,\\\" said Green, who was a bit of a wag in his way, as he, looked at the powder-boys still seated on their tubs, \\\"as you have still, got your heads on your shoulders, you may put some food into your, mouths.  Maybe you won't have another opportunity after we get up with, the big 'un we are chasing.  I told you, mates,\\\" he added, turning to, the crew of his gun, \\\"the captain knew what he was about, and would make, the Frenchmen haul down their flags before we hauled down ours.  I, should not be surprised if we got the whole lot of them.\\\"\\n\\nHe was now able, in spite of the wind, to get along where he had before, found it difficult to pass.  In one or two places only did the waves, rolling up wash round his feet, but the water was not of sufficient, depth to carry him off, and he gained the mouth of the cavern in safety., Jack was eagerly looking out for him, and both of them being very sharp, set, they lost no time in discussing some of the contents of the basket.\\n\\n\\\"I have been making inquiries as to what can be done for your friend, Pierre Turgot,\\\" he said.  \\\"As you told me he was not willingly on board, the privateer, I was able to state that in his favour, and I have, obtained leave for him to be removed to a private house, where he can, remain until he has recovered, and he will then, I hope, be allowed to, return to France without waiting for an exchange of prisoners.  Were he, to be sent back with others, he would probably at once be compelled to, serve afloat, and his great desire is, I understand, to return to his, own family, to follow his former occupation of a fisherman.\\\"\\n\\nTom, and the whole of the men who had been on the ladders, sneaked away, on either side, ashamed, at all events, of being found out, and still, looking with longing eyes at the boats astern.  Every now and then a, seaman was brought aft and placed under the doctor's care, but of the, number four were found to be past recovery, and it seemed doubtful, whether several others would revive.\\n\\nJack and Bill could scarcely refrain from laughing as the old woman ran, on, but they restrained themselves, and when she showed them the, contents of the basket, they merely said, \\\"Bon! bon! merci! merci!\\\", several times, and looked very well pleased, as indeed they were, for, there was food enough to last them two or three days, full allowance--, cheese and sausages, bread, figs, raisins, and butter, besides the, bottle of wine.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you what, messieurs, without food we shall make slow progress., I'll go into the village and try to procure some.  I shall easily learn, from some person, before I venture to enter, whether the gendarmes are, there, and if they are not, we shall be safe for the present.  They, will, I hope, fancying that you made your way back to the house of, Madame La Roche, have gone off there.  We must hope for the best, and I, will try and invent some reason for wishing to purchase food.  The kind, lady supplied me with money, so that I shall have no difficulty on that, score.\\\"\\n\\nAs Rayner, who had charge of the foremost guns, was watching her, he, caught sight of a young man in the uniform of a midshipman, who sprang, suddenly up through the companion-hatch, and, making his way aft, seemed, to be addressing the captain with energetic action.  Rayner got but a, glimpse of him, for the next moment there came a fearful roaring sound., The deck of the enemy's ship rose in the air, rent into a thousand, fragments.  Her masts and yards and sails shot upwards, and her dark, hull seemed suddenly to melt away.\\n\\n\\\"At first I had hopes that you would discover us and put back to take us, off; but when I perceived that you were on fire, I began to fear that we, should not be observed, though I did not say so to my companions in, misfortune, but endeavoured to keep up their spirits.  I told them that, if the ship with which they had been engaged should come back, my, countrymen would not look upon them as enemies, but would treat them, kindly, as people who had suffered a great misfortune.  When, however\\n\\nThe _Bombay Castle_ was rolling her away across the Bay of Biscay with a, northerly breeze.  She was a very different craft from the _Thisbe_, and, though more than twice her size, not nearly so comfortable.  Captain, Martin had received orders to avoid an engagement, except attacked, and, then to do his best to escape, as the stores she carried were of great, value, and were much required by the fleet.  Though several sail were, sighted supposed to be an enemy's squadron, she managed to escape from, them, and arrived safe at Gibraltar.  Here she was joined by the _Ione_, frigate, and the two ships sailed together, expecting to fall in with, the fleet off Toulon.\\n\\nAmong those who observed him was Bill Rayner.  Bill's wits were always, sharp, and they had been still more sharpened since he came to sea by, the new life he was leading.  He had his eyes always about him to take, in what he saw, and his ears open whenever there was anything worth, hearing.  It had struck him as a strange thing that so many prisoners, should submit quietly to be kept in subjection by a mere handful of, Englishmen.  On seeing the American skipper talking to his men, he crept, in unobserved among them.  His ears being wide open, he overheard, several words which dropped from their lips.\\n\\nnarrow windows close under the roof, they were left in almost perfect, obscurity, so that they could not venture to move from the spot where, they stood.  As, however, their eyes got accustomed to the gloom, they, found that they were in a room about twelve or fourteen feet square, the, floor and sides being of roughly hewn stone.  Round it ran a stone, bench, just above which they could see several massive iron rings fixed, in the walls.\\n\\nHe could not help thinking, as he hurried back towards the cave, that, she suspected he was one of the persons the soldiers were in search of., Although she wished to befriend him, her father might be in a different, mood.  There was the danger, too, that if poor Le Duc was caught, he, might be tortured to make him confess where his companions were.  Rayner, considered, therefore, that it would be imprudent to remain longer in, the cave, and that it would be safer even to carry Jack, should he be, unable to walk, than to delay their journey.\\n\\nRayner very gladly accepted the invitation.  Neither Oliver nor Mrs, Crofton had thought about the result, but before many weeks were over, Commander William Rayner was engaged to marry Mary Crofton, who had, given him as loving and gentle a heart as ever beat in woman's bosom., He told her how often he had talked about her when away at sea, and how, often he had thought of her, although he had scarcely dared to hope that, she would marry one who had been a London street boy and powder monkey.\\n\\nNo time was lost in procuring what was necessary, when Oliver returned, to the _Mouche_, for such was the name of the prize.  The corvette, making sail, she and the schooner ran on in company until they came off, the French part of the coast.  The commander then ordered Rayner to, stand in, directing him, should any people be seen on shore, to hoist a, white flag, and land the four Frenchmen.\\n\\n\\\"No, no, mate, you was not aboard the _Arethusa_!\\\" cried Jack Peek, who, had followed his captain at a short distance, and looking Tom in the, face.  \\\"You was not aboard the _Arethusa_.  I'll tell you what kept you, down.  It was conceit, idleness, drink, and cowardice; and I'll tell you, what gave our brave captain his first lift in the service.  It was his, truthfulness, his good sense, his obedience to the orders of his, superiors.  It was his soberness, his bravery; and if you, with your, learning and advantages, had been like him, you too might have been in, command of a dashing frigate, and not stumping about on one wooden leg\\n\\nreceived him with great honour, and wrote a letter on his behalf to our, King James the Second, who on his return to England gave him a ship., This was his introduction to the British Navy, in which he served with, distinction in the reigns of William the Third and Queen Anne.  But his, obscure origin is the point here under notice, and the following, traditional anecdote is preserved in Shropshire:--When a boy he was left, in charge of the house by his mother, who went out marketing.  The, desire to go to sea, long cherished, was irresistible.  He stole forth\\n\\n\\\"I have brought you some food and a bottle of wine, mes garcons,\\\" she, said, in a kind tone.  \\\"The general gave me permission, and I was very, glad to bring it, as I knew that you must be hungry.  Poor boys!  I, heard of your attempt to get away.  You would have been drowned to a, certainty if you hadn't been caught, and that would have been sad, for, one of you, they say, wanted to get back to see his mother.  I have got, a son at sea, so I can feel for her.  I wish he was safe back again.  I, don't know what they will do with you, but I hear that you are to be, tried to-morrow, and the Irish officer here says you are spies, and if, so, you will run a great chance of being hung, or, at all events, shut, up in a prison till you confess what you have been about.  Ah! but I, forgot.  They say you don't speak French, and you may not have, understood a word I have said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought over the means by which I could best preserve my life.  I, knew that it would not do to show the slightest fear, so arousing, myself, I said, `My friends, you are hungry, so am I, but we can endure, another day without eating.  Now I want you to understand that we are, more likely to be saved by an English vessel than by one of any other, nation, as there are three times as many English cruisers in these seas, as there are French, and ten times as many merchantmen.  If we are, picked up by an English vessel, you are sure to be well treated for my, sake, but if any accident were to happen to me--if I were to fall, overboard, for instance--there would be no one to say a word in your, favour.  Remember that I was the means of saving the lives of two of, you, although, when I plunged into the water and swam to you at the risk, of being caught by a shark, or sinking myself from fatigue, I did not, expect any return.  I suppose that you do not wish to be ungrateful.'\\n\\nIn this he was disappointed.  The day went by; the ship still lay, motionless on the waste of waters.  Another night came on.  It was not, until the sun again rose that the sails were heard to give several loud, flaps against the masts; a few cat's-paws were seen playing over the, surface of the water, and at length the canvas swelled out to an, easterly breeze.  The tacks were hauled aboard, and the _Lily_ stood in, the direction it was supposed the _Ione_ would be found, over the course, she had just come.\\n\\nJack made much slower progress.  He could not, he said, twist his tongue, about sufficiently to get out the words, even when he remembered them., Some, he found, were wonderfully like English, and those he recollected, the best, though, to be sure, they had different meanings.  One day the, cutter had stood out farther from the shore than usual, her nets being, down, when, at daybreak, a strange sail was seen in the offing.  The, captain, after taking one look at her, was convinced that she was an, enemy.\\n\\nAn alarm was given that the mizenmast was on fire in the captain's, cabin, and as Rayner looked over the side, he could see the flames burst, out of the lee ports.  The guns had not been loaded, but there was no, necessity to fire signals of distress.  The condition of the ship could, be seen from far along the shore, and it was hoped that boats would, as, she drew near, put off to her assistance.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid, Captain Martin, that we cannot hope to save the ship,\\\" he, said; \\\"the fire may be kept under for an hour or perhaps two hours, but, if it once makes its way through the hatchways and gets to the lower, decks, there is nothing to stop it.  I would strongly advise that the, boats should at once be got ready, so that as many lives as possible may, be preserved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There may not be much fun in it, but it's very necessary,\\\" answered, Bill.  \\\"If the men were not to practise at the guns, how could they fire, away properly when we get alongside an enemy?  See! some of the fresh, hands don't seem to know much what they are about, or the lieutenant, would not be growling at them in the way he is doing.  I am keeping my, eye on the old hands to learn how they manage, and before long, I think\\n\\nThe Frenchmen and blacks, eager to save themselves, paid no attention to, what he said.  On flew the boat on the summit of a sea, and carried, forward, the next instant her keel struck the sand.  Regardless of his, advice, they all at the same moment sprang forward, each man trying to, be the first to get out of the boat.  He and Tom Fletcher held on to the, thwarts.\\n\\nhis sister, at great risk, brought us food.  He will now be amongst, strangers, who do not understand his lingo, and the poor fellow will be, very sad and solitary; so I think he would like it, if I could get leave, to go and stay with him while the frigate remains in harbour.  I'll take, it as a great favour, sir, since you ask me what reward I should like\\n\\n\\\"This address seemed to have some effect on the men I had saved.  Each, of them uttered an exclamation of approval, while the two others, who, still retained some little strength, turned aside their heads, not, daring to look at me.  I did not move until night came on, when I, crawled from the place I had occupied, and lay down between the two men, who seemed most disposed to befriend me.  In the middle of the night I, awoke, and finding that there was a light breeze.  I endeavoured to, kneel up and ascertain if providentially any vessel were approaching.\\n\\nwas standing forward on the look-out, and, as may be supposed, he did, not allow an eye to wink.  Several times he thought that he could see, two dark objects rising above the horizon, but his imagination might, have deceived him, for they, at all events, grew no larger.  When his, watch was over, he came aft into the midshipmen's berth, where several, of his messmates were collected.  He might have turned in, for the night, was drawing on, but there were still two hours to daylight.  He, as well, as others, dropped asleep with their heads on the table.\\n\\nand that some blacks, who knew the Englishmen, had accompanied the, soldiers to assist in finding them.  As soon as I heard this I hastily, put some of the things into my bag, not waiting for the remainder, and, hurried out of the hut.  As I did so, what was my dismay to see three of, the soldiers, accompanied by one of the black fellows who had escaped, from the wreck!  Were I to have run away they would have suspected me\\n\\n\\\"You mind, sir, how we got out of the prison in France, and I don't see, why we shouldn't get out of this place,\\\" observed Jack, going to one of, the two narrow windows which the room contained, and looking forth., They were strongly-barred.  The night was dark, and he could only see, the glimmer of a light here and there in the distance.  It was, impossible also to ascertain the height of the window from the ground.\\n\\n\\\"Then I'm sure he will like you; he could not help doing so.  He is only, three years older than I am; just about your age I suppose.  He went to, sea when he was a very little fellow with poor dear papa, who was killed, in action.  Oliver was by his side at the time, and wrote us home an, account of the sad, sad event, saying how brokenhearted he was.  The, people were very kind to him.  Papa was lieutenant of the ship, and was, loved by all the men, as I am sure he would have been, remembering how, good and kind and gentle he was with us.\\\"\\n\\nThe wind was fair, the sea calm, and the traders bound for Jamaica, safely reached Port Royal harbour, the remainder being convoyed to the, other islands by the _Latona_ and _Lily_, which were afterwards to be, sent to cruise in search of the enemy's privateers.  Our hero had not, forgotten Tom Fletcher, but watched in the hopes of doing him a service, Jack's report of him had not been favourable.  He had talked of going, home to his father, and had plenty of money in his pocket to do so, but, instead of that he had gone to dancing-houses and similar places, resorted to by seamen, where his money rapidly disappeared.  He might, have fallen into the docks, or died in the streets, had not Jack found, him and brought him on board the _Lily_.  For some neglect of duty his, leave had been stopped, and, fortunately for himself, he was not allowed, to go on shore at Port Royal when the ship put in there.  Tom, however\\n\\nThe frigate and her fresh prize were meantime making the best of their, way across the Channel.  As the latter, a fast sailor, was not, materially injured, all sail was made on her, and she kept good way with, the _Thisbe_.  At the same time there was still the risk of either one, or both being taken by a French ship of superior force, though neither, was likely to yield without making every effort to escape.  A constant, look-out was kept from the mast-head, but as the ships got farther and, farther from the French coast, the hope of escaping without having again, to fight increased.\\n\\nit was one of mourning to many who had lost relatives and friends.  The, dead were carried on shore to be buried, the wounded conveyed to, hospitals, the Frenchmen were landed and marched off under an escort of, marines to the prisons prepared for them, and press-gangs were soon busy, at work to obtain fresh hands to supply the places of those who had, fallen, although many prime seamen volunteered to serve on board a, frigate which had already won a name for herself.\\n\\nThe game, however, was not to be all on one side.  The Frenchmen's guns, were heard going off as fast as they could get their matches ready., They could easily be distinguished by the far louder noise they made., Those from the two other forts at the same time could be heard firing, away.  Cries and shrieks rose from wounded men, and a loud explosion, as, if a gun had burst, rent the air.\\n\\n\\\"I only did my duty without thinking of being rewarded,\\\" answered Bill;, \\\"but I have been wishing since we took the prize that something could be, done for a young Frenchman who was badly hurt on board her by a shot, from the battery which fired at us.  He and his father saved Jack Peek, and me from drowning when we were blown up in the _Foxhound_, and his, family were afterwards very kind to us, and did their utmost to save us, from being carried off to prison, and when we were hid away in a cave\\n\\nhoping to get in shore of her and back to Cherbourg.  At once the, _Thisbe_ was put about, and then stood so as to cross the stranger's, bows.  The latter, on seeing this, hoisting French colours, rapidly, shortened sail and hauled up to the northward, the two ships crossing, each other on contrary tacks.  The _Thisbe_ fired her starboard, broadside, receiving one in return, and then going about, endeavoured to, get to windward of her antagonist.  This, however, she was unable to do\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, sir,\\\" said Jack; \\\"but, you see, to get it I must read and, write, and that's what I never could tackle.  I have tried pothooks and, hangers, but my fingers get all cramped up, and the pen splits open, and, I have to let it drop, and make a great big splash of ink on the paper;, and as for reading, I've tried that too.  I know all the letters when I, see them, but I can't manage to put them together in the right fashion\\n\\na neat cottage standing by itself in a small garden.  A pretty little, girl about thirteen years of age opened the door, and on seeing the, strangers summoned her mother, who at once appeared, and led the way to, the room she had prepared for Pierre's reception.  It was on the, ground-floor, and contained a dimity-covered bed, and a few other simple, articles of furniture, quite sufficient for all the young French, sailor's wants.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll help you.  You can show me what we had best do,\\\" said Jack., \\\"I am not going to draw back on account of the risk.  All must depend on, the weather.  If the wind comes off shore, and the sea goes down, I, should say that our best chance would be to build a raft.  We can do, that, if we can only find an axe and a saw, and we might get launched, before the Frenchmen find out the wreck.  The first thing we have to do, is to get on board, and when we are there, we must keep a bright, look-out to see that none of the natives are coming along the shore to, trap us.\\\"\\n\\nBill had a more imaginative mind, which was seldom altogether at rest., He fancied sometimes that he was escaping from the top of the tower, and, tumbling head over heels to the bottom; at others that he was running, along, with the Frenchmen shouting after him to stop.  Then he fancied, that one with a long pair of legs had overtaken him, and was grasping, him tightly by the arm.\\n\\nThe ticking of one of the mattresses was quickly cut up and formed into, a line, which was lowered.  Rayner, who held it, felt a gentle tug, and, as he hauled it up, what was the delight of the party to find two strong, files!  There could be no doubt that Le Duc had formed some plan to, assist them in escaping, or he would not have come thus furnished., Probably they had to thank Madame La Roche for suggesting it.  They did, not stop, however, to discuss the matter, but set to work immediately to, file away the bars, making as little noise as possible.  While two of, them were thus employed, the rest walked about the room, and talked and, laughed and sang, so as to drown the sound of the files.  Presently they, heard from the other side of the building the loud tones of a fiddle\\n\\nMany looked at the stranger with anxious eyes; the flag of France was, flying from her peak.  Eighteen guns grinned out from her ports on, either side--twice the number of those carried by the _Lily_, and of a, far heavier calibre.  As she got within range she opened fire, her shot, flying through the _Lily's_ sails, cutting her rigging and injuring, several of her spars, but her guns were so elevated that not a man was, hit on deck.\\n\\nThe sailors received the prize with astonishment and cheers of approval., The Admiral being told of the exploit, sent for Hopson and thus, addressed him, \\\"My lad, I believe you to be a brave youth.  From this, day I order you to walk the quarter-deck, and if your future conduct is, equally meritorious, you shall have my patronage and protection.\\\", Hopson made every effort to maintain the good opinion of his patron, and, by his conduct and attention to duty gained the respect of the officers, of the ship.  He afterwards went rapidly through the different ranks of, the service, till at length he attained that of Admiral.\\n\\n\\\"Get up, old fellow, and defend yourself,\\\" cried Brown.  \\\"I'm not the, chap to strike a man when he's down;\\\" and as he spoke he picked up the, officer's sword, and, helping him to his feet, presented it to him.  All, this was done so rapidly that Rayner and his companions arrived only, just in time to prevent Brown, who had stepped back a few paces, from, making a lunge with his bayonet at the astonished Frenchman, who, now, seeing an officer, though he did not recognise Rayner, again cried out, that he surrendered, and skipping out of Brown's way offered his sword.\\n\\nwith which he stood ready to heave when he should be near enough.  But, he felt his own strength failing.  It seemed almost beyond his power to, reach the wreck.  Still, it was not in his nature to give in, and making, a desperate effort, striking out through the surging waters, he clutched, the rope which Oliver hove-to him, and the next instant was clambering, on board.  Throwing himself down on the deck, he endeavoured to regain, his strength, Oliver grasping him tightly with one hand, while he held, to the stanchion with the other.\\n\\nIn a short time, making their way through the jungle, and crossing a, small stream which would afford them water, they saw before them a huge, tree, upturned from the roots, forming beneath it a cavern of, considerable size, which Le Duc and Tom were engaged in clearing out., There was a risk of being bitten by snakes, which might have made it, their abode, but that could not be avoided.  Le Duc was running his, stick into every hole he could see to drive out any which might be, concealed.  In other respects, no better place could be found.\\n\\nSuddenly he recognised Captain Rayner, who, from being dressed in plain, clothes, he had not at first observed.  He started, and then began, with, an impudent leer, \\\"Now, mates, I'll spin you another yarn about an, English captain who now holds his head mighty high, and would not, condescend to speak to poor Jack if he was to meet him.  We was, powder-monkeys together, that captain and I.  But luck is everything., He went up, and I went down.  That's the way at sea.  If all men had, their deserts I should be where he is, in command of a fine frigate, in, a fair way of becoming an admiral.  But it's no use complaining, and so, I'll sing on--\\n\\n\\\"I was raising myself on my elbow when I saw one of the men who had, threatened me by their words creeping towards me.  I instantly awoke my, two friends, for so I will call them, by exclaiming, `There is a breeze., Perhaps a vessel is approaching us.  We should not be sleeping;' while, the man whom I suspected of a design against my life drew back and lay, perfectly still.  I determined not again to fall asleep, if I could, avoid it, until daylight.  I believe, however, that I frequently dropped, off, but I was preserved.  When morning dawned, I discovered that the, man who had, as I believed, intended to kill me was utterly unable to, move.  The other fellow, however, seemed to be the strongest of the, party.  He got up, and stretching out his arms, exclaimed, addressing, his countrymen--\\n\\n\\\"Well, my boy, I will keep an eye on you,\\\" said the captain.  \\\"Mr, Saltwell, you will see what is best to be done with William Rayner,\\\" he, added, turning to the first lieutenant.  \\\"If you wish to learn to read, and write, you can come and get instruction every day from my clerk, Mr, Finch.  I will give him directions to teach you; but remember you are, not forced to do it.\\\"\\n\\nThe mess-tins were stowed away, and the watch hastened on deck.  The, wind by this time had somewhat freshened, and the frigate and her prize, were making better progress than before.  The strangers, however, which, had appeared in sight in the morning were considerably nearer.  A fourth, was now seen beyond the three which had been made out to the eastward., The ship to the westward which was considerably farther off than the, others, was evidently a large vessel, and the captain declared his, belief that she was a line-of-battle ship, but whether English or, French, it was impossible to decide.  He hoped, as did everybody on, board, that she was English, for should she prove to be French, as, undoubtedly were the vessels to the eastward, the _Thisbe_ would lose, her hard-won prize, even though she might manage to escape herself., Still, Captain Martin was not a man to give up hope while there was a, chance of escape.\\n\\nJack, with the rest of those who had been wounded, had been sent to the, hospital.  Rayner the next day obtained leave to visit him.  He was, sorry for Tom, who was thus left very much to his own resources, and he, tried to find an opportunity of speaking a kind word to his former, companion; but Tom, as before, sulkily kept aloof, so that he was, compelled to leave him to himself.  He was very sorry, soon after, to, see him being led along the deck by the master-at-arms.  Tom looked, dreadfully downcast and frightened.\\n\\nBill was not quite consistent in taking the cloth when he would not, touch the money, but it did not occur to him for a moment that he was, wrong in appropriating it, or he would have refused to do so.  Had he, argued the point, he would have found it very difficult to settle.  One, thing was certain, that the owners were never likely to make any, complaint on the subject.\\n\\nStill, hour after hour went by, and no enemy appearing, they began to, fear that the Frenchmen would get into port before they could be, overtaken.  At length, just before the sun reached the horizon, his rays, fell on the royals and topgallantsails of two ships right ahead.  As the, sun sank lower they were again lost to view, but their appearance, revived the hopes of all on board.  It was not likely that they would, alter their course during the night, and it was hoped, therefore, that, before morning they would be overtaken.  It was not likely that the, _Thisbe_ and _Venus_, being in the shadow, would have been perceived.\\n\\n\\\"There may be some difficulty in doing as you propose,\\\" replied the, captain.  \\\"Mr Saltwell will, however, I have no doubt, try to make a, satisfactory arrangement, for a person behaving as the young Frenchman, has done deserves to be rewarded; but that is not what I meant; I want, you to choose some reward for yourself, and wish you to let me know how, I can best serve you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It may be a hard job to do that,\\\" said Jack; \\\"and I should say it would, be easier to run off with a boat or some small craft which we two could, handle, and make our way in her across Channel.  I know where to find, the polar star.  I have often been out at night when father steered by, it, and we should be sure, some time or other, to make the English, coast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lads!\\\" cried the commander, who had observed some of them wavering as, they gazed with looks of alarm at their powerful enemy, \\\"most of you, have sailed in the _Lily_ with me since she was first commissioned.  You, know that I have never exposed your lives unnecessarily, and that we, have always succeeded in whatever we have undertaken.  You have gained a, name for yourselves and our ship, and I hope you will not sully that, name by showing the white feather.  Although yonder ship is twice as big, as we are, still we must try to beat her off, and it will not be my, fault if we don't.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the soldiers stepped aside and two black seamen were led, forward.  Rayner recognised them as the most ruffianly of the schooner's, crew.  First one, and then the other, swore that the vessel had been, sent to the coast for the purpose of landing some French spies, that the, schooner was to wait for them, and then when they had gained information, as to the strength of the forts and vessels in the harbours they were to, return to the frigate.\\n\\nI suppose, before long, get another step; and here am I sticking where I, was.  It's no fault of mine, that I can see.  I'll cut and run if I have, the chance, for I cannot bear to see others placed over my head, as you, and Bill Rayner have been, and to see him walking the quarter-deck in a, brand new uniform, and talking to the officers as friendly and easy as, if he had been born among them, while I, a gentleman's son, remain a, foremast man, with every chance of being one to the end of my days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we do we must manage to get out somehow or other, as we did before,\\\", answered Bill; \\\"but even if they do come up with us, that's no reason, why we should be taken.  We must try and beat them off, and the captain, and Mr Saltwell are the men to do it.  They are only four to our two, ships, for the lieutenant in charge of the prize will fight his guns as, well as we do ours.\\\"\\n\\nIt took upwards of an hour before the prisoners with their bags and, other personal property were removed to the _Foxhound_.  Captain Waring, and Lieutenant Saltwell turned their eyes pretty often towards the, harbour.  No ships were seen coming out of it.  The English frigate and, her two prizes consequently steered in the direction the other vessels, had gone, the captain hoping to pick up one or more of them during the, following morning.  Her diminished crew had enough to do in attending to, their proper duties, and in looking after the prisoners.\\n\\nwonders can be worked.  How I did bamboozle those stupid fellows!  It, was fortunate, however, that none of the black crew of the schooner or, my late shipmates appeared, or I should have been discovered.  Now, put, on these dresses, they are such as are worn by the planters of this, country, and you can pretend you are going to a fair at Goave to buy, mules, that is what Francois advises, and he has got a good head on his, shoulders.  I wish that he could have come with us, but as soon as he, had deposited these clothes he had to ride back as fast as he could to, attend to his mistress, and I undertook the rest.\\\"\\n\\naccording to the surveyor's report, it would take some months to put her, in thorough repair, and that in the meantime he had been appointed to, the command of the store-ship _Bombay Castle_, of sixty-four guns, bound, for the Mediterranean, and he should take his officers and crew with, him.  \\\"We all of us might wish for more active service, my lads, but we, shall not be long absent, and I hope by the time we come back that we, shall find our tight little frigate as ready for any duty she may be, sent on, as you all, I am sure, will be.\\\"\\n\\nAs it was growing dusk, Bill had no fear of being seen as he made his, way from the cavern.  He felt rather weak, but he had a brave heart, and, pushed on.  He had some rough rocks to climb over, and others he managed, to get round, walking through the water where it was not too deep., Sooner than he expected he reached the bay near which the Turgots', cottage was situated.  To avoid the other cottages and huts he had to, make a wide circuit.\\n\\nThe sea dashing over the reef, though spent of its fury, still broke, with great force against the hull of the schooner.  Her timbers shook, and quivered as wave after wave, striking them, rolled on towards the, beach, and then came hissing back, covering the surface of the lagoon, with a mass of creaming foam.  The coast, as far as could be seen, through the masses of spray, looked barren and uninviting.\\n\\nAs soon as this had been accomplished sufficiently to make sail, the, _Thisbe_, brought to the wind, stood after the flying enemy, firing her, bow chasers as she did so; but it was soon seen that she had little, chance of coming up with them.  Still her captain persevered; but, with, both masts and spars wounded, it was impossible to carry as much sail as, would otherwise have been done.  Consequently, before long the, line-of-battle ship, which made the signal _Terrible_, seventy-four\\n\\nThe raft was quickly cast loose, and, getting out the oars, they began, to paddle silently down the harbour.  They could not avoid making some, slight noise, but they hoped that there was no one on the watch to hear, it.  Very frequently they turned their glances astern to ascertain if, they were followed, but they could see nothing moving.  There were, several vessels lower down the harbour, so they steered a course which, would carry them past at some little distance from them.\\n\\nThe captain directed Rayner to keep astern of the other boats.  His eye, rested on his ship as if he desired to see her as long as she existed., The moment of her destruction came at last.  The rest of the crew having, landed, the yawl was nearing the shore, when a loud roar was heard as if, a whole broadside had been fired.  The flames rose high in the air; the, masts shot upwards surrounded by burning fragments of planks and, timbers; the stout sides, rent asunder, rushed outwards, and in another, minute a few blackened fragments of the gallant ship, which had that, morning floated trim and proudly on the ocean, were alone visible.\\n\\nOur hero spent a few happy days with the kind widow and Mary, who both, evidently took a warm interest in his welfare.  It was the first time he, had been living on shore, except during his sojourn in France, since he, first went to sea.  He was introduced to some of the few friends they, possessed, and he made several pleasant excursions with them to visit, some of the beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood of Plymouth.  His, observation, unknown to himself, enabled him rapidly to adapt himself to, the manners of people of education, and no one would have recognised in, the gentlemanly young midshipman the powder monkey of a short time back., It was with more regret than he supposed he could possibly have felt, that he received a summons to join the _Lily_, now fitting out with all, despatch for the West Indies.  Though he no longer belonged to the, _Thisbe_, it was with much sorrow that he heard she was pronounced unfit, for sea, and that her crew had been dispersed.  He made inquiries for, Jack and Tom.  The former, he discovered, had gone to pay his mother a, visit; but, though he searched for Tom, he could nowhere hear of him.\\n\\nMadame La Roche, coming in, took the head of the table, and the young, ladies, sailing like swans into the room, placed themselves by the side, of their guests, on the strangeness of whose costumes they made not the, slightest remark.  Rayner and Oliver had become somewhat faint from long, fasting, but their spirits quickly revived after they had eaten some of, the viands placed before them.  At first they supposed that the repast, was served up solely on their account, but from the way the girls and, their mother kept them in countenance, they were satisfied that they had, simply come in for the family supper.\\n\\n\\\"I am ready to believe the account you give me, and that you certainly, are not spies,\\\" he said.  \\\"The body of your countryman found on the, beach proves that you were shipwrecked.  Still, as you are in the, country, we must consider you as prisoners of war, and treat you as, such.  For this night you must remain here, and to-morrow I will, consider whether I will send you to Leogane or Le Trou, where you will, wait with others of your countrymen to be exchanged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The lads do not understand French, that is evident,\\\" said the officer, to a subordinate standing near him; \\\"I shall get nothing out of them, without an interpreter.  They do not look stupid either, and they must, be bold fellows, or they would not have attempted to made a voyage on, that raft.  I must have a nearer look at it;\\\" and he ordered the boatmen, to bring it in close to the shore, so that he might examine it.\\n\\nBill therefore had to wait till he could make his way on deck without, being remarked.  Pretending to drop asleep, he lay perfectly quiet for, some time; then sitting up and rubbing his eyes, he staggered away, forward, as if still drowsy, to make it be supposed that he was about to, turn into his hammock.  Finding that he was unobserved, he crept up by, the fore-hatchway, where he found Dick, who was in the watch off deck.\\n\\nAn order was passed along the decks that not a gun should be fired till, the captain gave the word.  The boys had not forgotten their fight a few, weeks before, and had an idea that this was to turn out something like, that.  Then the shot of the enemy had passed between the masts and the, rigging; but scarcely one had struck the hull, nor had a man been hurt\\n\\n\\\"No doubt about that, youngster,\\\" answered Ben Twinch, the boatswain's, mate, who overheard Tom's remark.  \\\"What do you think we come to sea, for?  If we can take a man-of-war of our own size she's worth half a, dozen merchant craft, though, to be sure, some of us may lose the number, of our mess; but we all know that, and make no count of it.  Maybe, you'll have your head taken off one of these days, and if you do, you'll, only share the fate of many another fine fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quick, lads, quick, and I'll try to get hold of one or both of them, if, I can,\\\" cried Ben, fastening the rope round his body.  His example was, followed by another man, who, in the same way, secured a rope round, himself, when both plunged in and seized the well-nigh drowning, strangers, just as, utterly exhausted, they had let go their hold.  They, were able, however, to speak, and Rayner discovered that they were, French.\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you what it is, Mr Rayner,\\\" exclaimed Ben; \\\"no man who, hasn't been down to the bottom of Stromboli or down Etna will be able to, live two minutes in the cockpit, and I cannot help you, sir, to throw, your life away.  The ship's on fire somewhere forward, and what we've, got to do is to pump the water over it, and try and put it out.  If we, can't do that, we must shut down the hatches, and see if we can't, smother it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am very sorry for it,\\\" remarked Oliver; \\\"for from the experience I, have had of them, I think it more than possible, if they can get the, assistance of the black crew, they will try and play us some scurvy, trick.  I have not hitherto pointed out the fellow who tried to take my, life, and who was so nearly dying himself; but I suspect his disposition, has not altered for the better.  You'll fancy me somewhat suspicious\\n\\nand recollected that the success of the undertaking might considerably, depend upon him.  The night was very dark, but as the boats got up to, the mouth of the harbour the lights on shore could be distinguished, as, well as several on board vessels at anchor.  The boats kept clear of the, latter, lest any of their people might discover them and give the alarm., The barge led, the launch and cutter following in succession.  The, success of the undertaking would depend on their being able to take the, enemy by surprise.\\n\\ndischarging her broadside, she raked the _Thisbe_ fore and aft.  In vain, the latter tried to escape from her critical position; before she could, do so she was a second time raked, the gaff being shot away, the, mizenmast injured, and the remaining rigging cut through and through., Fortunately, the _Thisbe_ still answered her helm, and the crew were, endeavouring to make sail, when the enemy ranged up on the starboard, quarter, her forecastle being covered with men, evidently intending to, board.\\n\\n\\\"That's just it, sir.  If two small boys could get out of a French, prison, I am thinking that five well-nigh grown men can manage the job., We'll do it, sir, never fear.  If this stone was granite it might puzzle, us, but it's softer than that by a long way, and I have already cut out, some of it with my knife, though, to be sure, it does blunt it, considerably.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You acted rightly, Captain Dupont,\\\" said the general.  \\\"Let them be, brought to my quarters, and I'll send for Colonel O'Toole to, cross-question them.\\\"  Bill and Jack understood every word that was, said.  \\\"We are in for it,\\\" said Bill; \\\"but we must put a bold face on, the matter, and speak the truth.  We can say that we were living in the, cavern for some time, and that when the brig was wrecked, we resolved at, once to build a raft, and get back to our own country.\\\"\\n\\nOur hero had now got the first step up the ratlines as an officer.  As, the _Lily's_ repairs were likely to occupy some time, Captain Saltwell, had, by the admiral's permission, fitted out one of the prizes, a fine, and fast little schooner, to which the name of the _Active_ had been, given.  He intended to man her from his own and the _Ariel's_ crews, and, to send her cruising in search of the piratical craft which, under the, guise of privateers, in vast numbers infested those seas.\\n\\nThe captain had not forgotten Bill, who, by the timely information he, had given, had materially contributed to preserve the ship from capture., Bill himself did not think that he had done anything wonderful; his, chief anxiety was lest the fact of his having given the information, should become known.  The sentinel might guess at it, but otherwise the, captain alone could know anything about it.  Bill, as soon as he had, told his story to the captain, and found that it was credited, stole, away forward among the rest of the crew on deck, where he took very good, care not to say a word of what had happened; so that not till the, trustworthy men received orders to be prepared for an outbreak were they, aware of what was likely to occur.\\n\\n\\\"I'll try it, sir,\\\" cried Ben Twinch, the boatswain's mate, one of the, most powerful men in the ship.  \\\"I'd like, howsomdever, to have a line, round my waist.  Do you stand by, mates, and haul me back if I don't, make way; there are some ugly bits of timber floating about, and one of, them may give me a lick on the head, and I shan't know what's, happening.\\\"\\n\\nAs they got higher up, the sound of voices came off the shore, as if the, people were laughing and making merry.  This gave Mr Saltwell hopes, that many of the crew were landed, and that those on board would be, totally unprepared for an attack.  He intended to board on the starboard, quarter, and he had given directions to the other officers, one to board, on the larboard quarter and the other at the main chains, his object, being to overpower the resistance the officer's would make aft, then to, sweep the decks until the forecastle was gained.  One of the boats was, immediately to shove ahead and cut the cable, while certain of the men, had been directed to hoist the headsails, so that the prize might\\n\\nHis only regret now was that he could no longer talk with Jack and Tom, as he had been accustomed to do, though he hoped that he should still be, able, without doing anything derogatory to his new position, to speak to, them in a friendly way.  Thinking highly of Jack as he did, he regretted, more than ever that his former messmate could neither read nor write., He felt sure that he would, should he have an opportunity, do something, to merit promotion.\\n\\nAs soon as Rayner got up, by Francois' directions he shut down the, trapdoor.  There was just light sufficient, through a pane of glass in, the roof, to see that the loft extended over a considerable portion of, the building.  Part only was covered with boards, on which, according to, the instructions given them, they laid down.  Francois had charged them, on no account to move about, lest they should be heard by the people, below.  The planks, however, were not placed very close together, and, after they had been there a minute or so, Rayner discovered a glimmer of, light coming through a broadish chink.\\n\\nJudging by the still louder scraping of Le Duc's fiddle, he must have, suspected what they were about.  Oliver could hear the notes coming, round from the other side of the building.  All, however, below him was, silence and darkness.  He could not judge, as he looked down, whether he, was to alight on hard or soft ground, whether into a ditch or stream, or, whether they should have a fence to climb.  His chief fear was that some, of the dogs allowed to go loose in every country house might discover, him and his companions before they could effect their escape.\\n\\nHe went on, keeping his gaze ahead, in the hopes of meeting Jack.  He, was sorry that he had not made more determined attempts to persuade, Captain Turgot and Pierre to accompany him; for if anything should have, happened to his companion, they would have assisted him.  But what could, have happened? that was the question.  Sometimes he thought that Jack, might, after all, not have come to the cavern; but, then, who could have, carried away the basket?\\n\\n\\\"I considered how I could best preserve my life, as I thought it very, possible that you would send the privateer to the bottom should she not, yield or try to escape.  I determined, should I find her sinking, to, leap out through one of the stern windows of the captain's cabin.  I, accordingly made my way there, and was looking out for some instrument, with which to force open the window when I saw smoke curling up through, an opening in the deck below me.  I at once knew that it must arise from, a spot at no great distance from the magazine.  In the hopes of inducing, the commander to send some men down to try and extinguish the fire, before it was too late, I sprang on deck.  Scarcely had I reached it\\n\\n\\\"Well, we will soon see all about that,\\\" said the colonel, beginning to, search Bill; but, greatly to his surprise, he found nothing whatever, about him, except his knife, the whole of Bill's worldly wealth, \\\"I told, you so, sir,\\\" said Bill, when he had finished.  \\\"I spoke only the truth, about myself and my companion.\\\"  Bill said this, hoping that Jack would, escape the search; but the colonel was far too knowing, and presently he, seized upon Jack, who, in spite of his efforts to appear unconcerned\\n\\n\\\"At daylight I awoke.  The sea was calm.  I gazed anxiously around.  Not, a speck was visible in the horizon.  The sun rose, and its rays beat, down upon us with even greater fury than on the previous day, or, at all, events, I suffered more, as did my companions.  They now cried out for, water and food, and I saw them eye me with savage looks.  I pretended, not to observe this, and said that I hoped and thought that we might, catch some fish or birds.\\n\\n\\\"They have heard me talking French to the officers, and will be careful, what they say when they see me near them,\\\" answered Bill; \\\"but there's, my messmate, Jack Peek, who was in France with me, and knows their, `lingo' as well as I do; and as they have not heard him talking, they'll, not suspect him; and if you will allow me, sir, I will tell him to go, among them, and he'll soon find out if they have any thoughts of, mischief.\\\"\\n\\nThe _Thisbe_ was in too crippled a condition to follow.  Several shot, had passed between wind and water on both sides.  One gun on the, quarter-deck and two on the maindeck were dismounted, and almost all the, tackles and breachings were cut away.  The maindeck before the mainmast, was torn up from the waterway to the hatchways, and the bits were shot, away, as was the chief part of the gangways.  Not an officer had been, killed, but two midshipmen, the master, and gunner, were wounded., Twenty men were wounded and eleven lost the number of their mess.\\n\\nThe British crew, working with redoubled energy, hauled their guns in, and out, and fired with wonderful rapidity, truly tossing them about as, if they had been playthings.  The French also fired, but far more, slowly, sending hardly one shot to the _Lily's_ two.  The officers went, about the deck encouraging the men and laying hold of the tackles to, assist them in their labours.  At any moment a well-directed broadside, from the frigate might leave the corvette a mere wreck on the ocean, or, send her to the bottom.  Every man on board knew this; but while their, officers kept their flag flying at the peak, they were ready to work, their guns and struggle to the last.\\n\\nalthough the flames had not yet burst out, it became of the greatest, importance to get the powder out of the magazine.  For this purpose the, second lieutenant descended with a party of men, and succeeded in, bringing up a considerable quantity, which was stowed in the stern, gallery.  All the other hands, not otherwise employed, were engaged, under the different officers in heaving water down the hatchways; but, the smoke increased to such a degree that they were compelled to desist\\n\\nand at length it was found that the powder could be drawn, up and hove, overboard out of the gallery windows.  Several of the officers, volunteered for this dangerous duty.  Rayner, notwithstanding that he, had just before escaped suffocation, again twice descended, and was each, time drawn up more dead than alive.  Several hours had now gone by, and, the wind providentially holding fair, the ship was nearing the land., Meantime, the fire was fast gaining on them, and might at any moment, triumph over all the heroic efforts of the crew to subdue it.  The heat, below was intense.  The first lieutenant, going forward, found that the, hatches had been blown off, as also the tarpaulins placed over the, gratings.  As it was of the greatest importance to keep them on, he, directed the carpenter, with as many men as could be obtained, to, replace them, while he returned once more aft, to superintend the, operation of getting up the powder.\\n\\nExpressions of gratitude rose from the lips of the Frenchmen when Rayner, had translated what Captain Martin had said.  The magistrate then, offered to receive as many as his own house could accommodate, as did, two gentlemen who had accompanied him, their example being followed by, other persons, and before morning the whole of the shipwrecked seamen, were housed, including three or four officers, the only ones saved.  The, poor fellows endeavoured by every way in their power to show how, grateful they were for the kindness they were receiving.\\n\\n\\\"You'll not do that,\\\" answered Rayner, knowing very well that Tom did, not dream of putting his threat into execution; \\\"but I'll tell the first, lieutenant what you say about your wish to see your family, though I, fear it will not influence him in recommending the captain to remit your, punishment.  I would advise you, whatever happens, to submit, and to, try, by doing your duty, to gain a good name for yourself,\\\" said Rayner\\n\\n\\\"I know that, well enough; but it was my brother who answered the, letter; and, as my father is a clever man, I daresay by this time he has, become rich again, and, for very shame at having a son of his a common, ship's boy, would do as I wish.  Can't you tell the captain that, and, perhaps he'll excuse me the flogging?  It's very hard to be prevented, seeing my family, and to be flogged into the bargain.  It's more than I, can bear, and I've a great mind to jump overboard and drown myself when, I get my wrists out of these irons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I will never allow that,\\\" was the answer.  \\\"We'll get you along a, little farther, until we can find some place to rest in.  There's a wood, I see ahead, and we must conceal ourselves in it until you are able to, go on again.  If Mr Crofton likes to lead on the rest and try to get, across the frontier, he may do so, but I'll stick by you, Jack.  Don't, be afraid.\\\"\\n\\nBill was anxious to get back to poor Jack, who he remembered was, well-nigh starving.  Jeannette would have accompanied him part of the, way, but she had to remain at home to receive Captain Turgot and Pierre., She had, in the meantime, packed a basket with provisions for Jack and, himself, that they might be independent for a couple of days.  He, therefore jumped up, and, begging her to remember him very kindly to the, others, he bade her farewell, and, with the basket on his arm, slipped, out of the house as cautiously as he had entered.\\n\\nHe had a short time before come off with a party of men returning on the, expiration of their leave.  Telling them that he wished to go to sea, he, had been allowed to enter the boat.  From the questions some of them had, put to him, and the answers he gave, they suspected that he was a, runaway, and such in fact was the case.  Tom was the son of a solicitor, in a country town, who had several other boys, he being the fourth, in, the family.\\n\\nNo steamboats ploughed the ocean, nor were railroads thought of, when, our young friends Jack, Tom, and Bill lived.  They first met each other, on board the _Foxhound_ frigate, on the deck of which ship a score of, other lads and some fifty or sixty men were mustered, who had just come, up the side from the _Viper_ tender; she having been on a cruise to, collect such stray hands as could be found; and a curious lot they were, to look at.\\n\\nThough sorry to leave his kind friends, Bill was very glad to be at sea, again, and engaged in the active duties of his profession.  His, messmates treated him with much kindness, and remarked among themselves, the improvement in his manners, while two or three fresh members of the, mess, when they heard how he had gained his promotion, looked upon him, with evident respect.  He did not, however, forget his old friends, and, Jack was always pleased when he came forward to talk to him, and did not, appear at all jealous, which could not be said of Tom, who, though he, did not venture to show his feelings, was inclined to keep out of his, way, and sometimes answered in rather a surly tone when spoken to\\n\\nAfter marching about a couple of miles, they reached a small town, or, village rather, the houses being scattered along the shores of another, bay much larger than the one they had left.  A river of some size ran, into the bay, and on a point of land near the mouth, on a height, stood, an old tower, which had been built, apparently, for the purpose of, guarding the entrance.\\n\\nof the cavern; still he thought, \\\"I must have the gold.  It would be so, foolish to go away without it.  It belongs to us as much as to anybody, else, seeing that the owners are dead.  Their ghosts won't come to look, for it, I hope.  I wish I hadn't thought of that.  I must be going, right.  It would have been much pleasanter if Bill had been with me., Why didn't I try to persuade him to stop?\\\"\\n\\nAll this passed through his mind as he was letting himself down the, rope, to which he clung with arms and feet as a sailor only can cling, with security.  He soon reached the bottom.  The ground appeared to be, firm, and was, as far as he could judge, perfectly level.  The tower, threw a dark shadow, in which he stood listening for any sounds which, might indicate danger.  It had been agreed, even should one or two of, the gendarmes come round, to spring upon them, seize their arms, and gag, them.  As soon as his feet touched the ground, he pulled out his, handkerchief, ready for the latter object.  Presently another came down., It was Brown, the best man to tackle an enemy, as his muscular strength, was equal to any two of the rest.  No enemy appeared, however, and at, length Rayner, who came last, reached the bottom in safety.\\n\\nHe got back safely, and the food he brought soon restored the spirits of, the party.  Even Jack declared that he was strong enough to walk a dozen, miles if necessary.  They were in great hopes, therefore, of getting, across the border before daybreak.  They regretted greatly the loss of, Le Duc, who had served them so faithfully, especially as they feared, that he himself was in danger of suffering in consequence of the, assistance he had given them.\\n\\n\\\"William Rayner,\\\" said the captain, \\\"you have, I understand, behaved, remarkably well on several occasions, twice especially, by saving Mr, Saltwell's life through your coolness and presence of mind.  You are, also, I find, a fair French scholar, and the first lieutenant reports, favourably of your conduct in your former ship.  I wish to reward you., Let me know how I can best do so in a way satisfactory to yourself.\\\"\\n\\nThe manoeuvre was repeated several times, causing the frigate to lose, ground; but a fortunate shot would have enabled her quickly to regain, it.  Though several of the _Thisbe's_ shot took effect, the chase, continued her course, firing in return from a gun run out astern; but, none of the shot struck her pursuer.  At last, however, the chase ran, past the battery, which shortly afterwards opened fire.  Captain Martin, returned it with such effect that two of the guns were silenced, when, the frigate's head was put off shore, and she stood away to avoid the, risk of being becalmed should the wind fall, as was very likely, towards, evening.\\n\\neven at spring-tide, with the wind off shore, the water might not reach, to where they sat; yet should a gale blow from the northward, it might, drive the waves far up the cavern, and expose them to great danger.  \\\"We, cannot tell what may happen,\\\" he said, \\\"and it's as well to be prepared, for the worst.  Besides, if the soldiers come to look for us, they may, find the mouth of the cavern, and make their way some distance in, but, if they do not discover us they'll fancy we are not here, and go away, again as wise as they came.\\\"\\n\\nJack Peek had probably never made so long a speech in his life.  It was, perhaps too long, for it enabled the old sailor to recover his presence, of mind, and looking at Jack with a brazen countenance, he declared that, he had never seen him before, when off he went as fast as he could walk, on his wooden stumps, and turning down a by-lane was lost to view.\\n\\nSome more bread and water was brought them in the morning, and a similar, unpalatable meal was provided in the afternoon.  This was evidently to, be their only food during their imprisonment.  They had no one to, complain to, no means of obtaining redress; so, like wise men, they made, up their minds to bear it, though Tom grumbled and growled all day long, at the way in which he was treated.\\n\\nSupper was quickly got through, and each man stowed away the remainder, of the provisions in his pockets.  While they went to work with their, knives at the bars, Rayner and Oliver examined the beds.  They were, thankful to find that the canvas at the bottom was lashed by pieces of, tolerably stout rope.  These, with the aid of the ticking cut into, strips, would form a line of sufficient length and strength to enable, them to descend, should they succeed in getting out the bars.  This\\n\\nThe next morning the gruff voice of the boatswain's mate summoned all, hands to turn out, and on going on deck they saw \\\"Blue Peter\\\" flying at, the fore, while shortly afterwards the Jews and all other visitors were, made to go down the side into the boats waiting for them.  The captain, came on board, the sails were loosed, and while the fife was setting up, a merry tune, the seamen tramped round at the capstan bars, and the, anchor was hove up.\\n\\nlifted the vessel, and driving over the ledge on which she had first, struck, carried her between some dark rocks, till she stuck fast on the, sandy shore.  Had the people been able to cling to her till now, some, might possibly have been saved, but they had apparently all been on deck, when the vessel struck, and been swept away by the first sea which, rolled over her.  The seas still continued to sweep along her deck, but, their force was partly broken by the rocks, and being evidently a stout, vessel, she hung together.\\n\\nTalking the matter over, it was objected that such a story might offend, peaceable folk, because it must deal too much with blood and gunpowder., Mr Kingston, although famed as a narrator of sea-fights, was a lover of, peace, and he said that his story would not encourage the war spirit., Those who cared chiefly to read about battles might turn to the pages of, \\\"British Naval History.\\\"  He chose the period of the great war for his, story, because it was a time of stirring events and adventures.  The, main part of the narrative belongs to the early years of life, in which, boys would feel most interest and sympathy.  And throughout the tale\\n\\nThe inventions of modern science and art are producing a great change in, all that pertains to life at sea.  The revolution is more apparent in, war than in peace.  There is, and always will be, a large proportion of, merchant ships under sail, even in nations like our own where steam is, in most general use.  In war, a wooden ship without steam and without, armour would be a mere floating coffin.  The fighting _Temeraire_, and, the saucy _Arethusa_, and Nelson's _Victory_ itself, would be nothing, but targets for deadly fire from active and irresistible foes.  The odds, would be about the same as the odds of javelins and crossbows against, modern fire-arms.  Steam alone had made a revolution in naval warfare;, but when we add to this the armour-plating of vessels, and the terrible, artillery of modern times, \\\"the wooden walls of old England\\\" are only, fit to be used as store-ships or hospitals for a few years, and then, sent to the ship-yards to be broken up for firewood.  But though, material conditions have changed, the moral forces are the same as ever\\n\\nJack, however, soon again took the file, and in a short time announced, that both the centre bars were cut through at the bottom.  They had next, to file the upper bars sufficiently to enable Brown to bend them back., Losing patience, however, he at last seized one of them, when, placing, his feet against the window, he bent back with all his strength.  He was, more successful than he expected, for the iron giving way, down he fell, on the floor with a tremendous crash, which would certainly have been, heard by the guards below, had not their attention been drawn off by the, fiddle of Le Duc, who was scraping away with more vehemence than ever., Rayner and Oliver had in the meantime been manufacturing the rope by, which they hoped to descend to the ground.  They could measure the, necessary length by the small line with which the files had been drawn, up, and they had the satisfaction of finding that it was amply long, enough for their purpose.  They now secured it to one of the remaining, bars.  Rayner and Oliver agreed that it would be wise to descend while, the fiddle was going.\\n\\nIt is too true a saying that \\\"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the, lip.\\\"  The _Ione_ was about midway between the Spanish coast and, Majorca, when, as morning broke, a number of ships were seen standing, out from the direction of Minorca.  At first it was supposed that they, were part of the English fleet, but after two of the lieutenants had, taken a careful survey of them from aloft, it was decided that they were, French.\\n\\nSoon after the _Lily_ left Jamaica she fell in with the _Ariel_.  As a, calm came on while they were in company, the officers of the two ships, paid visits to each other.  Rayner, recollecting that Mary Crofton's, brother Oliver was serving in her, got leave to go on board, for the, purpose of making his acquaintance.  He was much disappointed, on, inquiring for him, to learn that he had been sent away a few days, before, in charge of a prize, a brig called the _Clerie_, with orders to, take her to Jamaica.\\n\\nTom Fletcher, as soon as the ship got into harbour, managed to procure a, pen and some ink and paper, and indited a letter to his father.  It was, not over-well written, but he contrived to make it pretty clearly, express that he was serving on board H.M.S.  _Thisbe_, and that having, already seen a great deal of service, he felt sure that if his father, would apply to the Admiralty and make him an allowance of thirty or, forty pounds a year, he should be placed on the quarter-deck, and in due, course of time become an admiral.\\n\\nas the boat was overloaded, they were about to heave me overboard, when, I opened my eyes, and sang out, `Don't;' so they let me remain, and, after some time pulled alongside a cutter, on board which we were taken, and looked after below.  Shortly afterwards we went in chase of a French, craft of the same rig as ours, but she got away, and we then steered for, Plymouth.  We were at first taken on board the guardship, where we, remained some time, and then I was transferred with others to this, frigate, the _Thisbe_, of which, to my great satisfaction, I found that, Mr Saltwell had been appointed first lieutenant.  Thinking that, as we, had shared a common misfortune, he would stand my friend, I went up to, him, and telling him that I was a gentleman's son, begged he would have, me put on the quarter-deck.  He told me that if I did my duty I should, have as good a chance as others; but here I am set to scrape potatoes, and clean pots and pans.  It's a shame, a great shame, and I can't stand, it.\\\"\\n\\nThey found their way easily enough; but Jack, as before, did not feel, quite comfortable as he saw the strange figures, which seemed to be, flitting about the sides of the cavern; sometimes, too, he fancied that, he detected faces grinning down upon him from the roof, and more than, once he declared positively that he had caught sight of a figure robed, in white stealing along in front of them.\\n\\n\\\"I knew you would not desert us, Rayner,\\\" he said.  \\\"But now you have, come, how are we to get this poor fellow to the shore?  I could not, leave him, or I would not have allowed you to risk your life by, returning on board.  We must try and knock a raft together sufficient to, carry Peek, and you and I will swim alongside it, if we cannot make it, large enough to hold us all three.  There's no time to be lost, though.\\\"\\n\\nBill did not scold him, vexed as he felt at the delay which had, occurred.  They might still be in time to get on board the wreck and to, launch their raft, but it would be broad daylight before they could get, to any distance from the shore, and they would then be sure to be seen., Bill only hoped that no one would think it worth while to follow them.\\n\\n\\\"Although I saw several coveys of flying-fish leaping out of the water, in the distance, none came near us.  Once I caught sight of the black, fin of a shark gliding by; presently the creature turned, and as it, passed it eyed us, I thought, with an evil look; but while the water was, calm, there was no risk of its getting at us.  Had the brute been, smaller, we might have tried to catch it.  I remembered having heard of, several people who saved their lives, when nearly starved, by getting, hold of a shark.  One of the men stuck out his leg, and when the, creature tried to grab it, a running bowline was slipped round its head\\n\\nThe dawn now broke, and they eagerly looked out on every side for a, sail.  As the light increased they were greatly disappointed, on gazing, astern, to discover the French coast still in sight, though blue and, indistinct, like a cloud rising out of the water.  No sail, however, was, to be seen in that direction.  That was a comfort; they were not pursued, by any large craft, and could certainly not be seen from the shore.\\n\\nBill's voice greatly re-assured Jack, who, fancying that he saw one of, the ghosts he was afraid of, had fallen down in a sort of swoon.  How, long it would have lasted if Bill had not come to him it is impossible, to say; perhaps long enough to have allowed his candle to be, extinguished.  Had this happened, he would never have been able to find, his way out of the cavern.  He, however, with Bill by his side, soon, felt like himself again.\\n\\nthey were up to the rear of it before the garrison were aware of the, capture of the larger fort.  By a sudden dash it was taken as the former, had been, the _British_ not losing a single man, though several of its, defenders, attempting to stand their ground, were cut down.  A rocket, let off the moment they were in was the signal to the _Ariel_ to cease, firing.\\n\\nBill said he would consider the subject, and in the meantime they made a, further survey of their prison.  It could not be called luxuriantly, furnished, considering that there was only a bench of no great width, running along the side of one of the walls, and the remains of a table., One of the legs had gone, and part of the top, and it was propped up by, a couple of empty casks.\\n\\n\\\"If I go to Mr Saltwell, perhaps he will think I was dreaming, and tell, me to `turn into my hammock and finish my dreams,'\\\" he thought to, himself.  \\\"No!  I'll go to the captain at once; perhaps the sentry will, let me pass, or if not, I'll get him to ask the captain to see me.  He, cannot eat me, that's one comfort; if he thinks that I am bringing him a, cock-and-bull story, he won't punish me; and I shall at all events have, done my duty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you think it's made of?\\\" asked Bill.  \\\"Why, sheets and blankets, and ticking,\\\" replied Jack.  \\\"Yes,\\\" said Bill, \\\"you are right; and with, those selfsame sheets and blankets, and maybe a fathom or two of rope, besides, underneath, I intend that we shall try to lower ourselves down, to the ground; and when we are once outside, it will be our own fault if, we do not get back to the harbour, and when there, that we do not get on, board our raft again.  The French captain said it was to be left just as, it was for the general to see it to-morrow morning.  Before that time, comes, I hope that we shall be out of sight of land, if we get a fair, breeze, or, at all events, out of sight of the people on shore.\\\"\\n\\nwith the other tied up to deceive the people.  It's hard things I'm, saying, I know, but I cannot stand by and hear a fellow who ought to, know better running monstrous falsehoods off his reel as you have been, doing.  You might have borne up for Greenwich, and been looked after by, a grateful country; or you might have saved money enough to have kept, yourself in comfort to the end of your days; but it all went in drink, and debauchery, and now you abuse the government for not looking after, you.  Howsumdever, Tom Fletcher, I'm very sorry for you, and if you'll, knock off this sort of vagabond life, which brings disgrace on the name, of a British sailor, I'll answer for it our good captain will exert his, influence and get you a berth in Greenwich or elsewhere, for he has, often spoken about you, and wondered where you were a-serving.\\\"\\n\\nor a privateer.  If such were the case, and the _Thisbe_ could get up to, her, she would be captured to a certainty, though she would probably, fight, and try to knock away some of the _Thisbe's_ spars, so as to, effect her escape.  The wind, which had hitherto been blowing from the, southward and south, suddenly shifted to the east.  As soon as the, stranger felt it, she was seen to haul her tacks on board, brace up her, yards, and stand away towards the land.\\n\\nsturdy fellow, whose cutlass had already brought two of the English, seamen to the deck, suddenly attacked him, hoping to regain the ship., The sailors had enough to do to defend themselves, and the big boatswain, was making a desperate blow at the lieutenant's head, when Bill, who, thought it a time to use his pistol with effect, fired, and the, boatswain fell, his cutlass dropping from his hand.  His followers on, this sprang back, and, throwing down their weapons, cried for mercy.\\n\\nIt was making a dreadful uproar in the cavern, and he wanted to, ascertain what chance there was of the waves washing in.  There was not, much risk, to be sure, of their reaching as far as they then were, but, it was as well to be on the safe side, and if there was a likelihood of, it they would move farther up and carry their provisions and store of, fuel with them, the only property they possessed.\\n\\nAs their torches were by this time nearly burnt out, they could not, venture to stop and examine the goods, but had to hurry back as fast as, they could.  They had managed to get through the narrow passage, and had, made some progress in their return, when both of them were obliged to, let their torches drop, as they could no longer hold them without, burning their hands.  They might have lighted their candles, had they, been in any difficulty, but their fire enabled them to find their way, along, though they stumbled frequently over the inequalities of the, ground, and once or twice Jack clutched Bill's arm, exclaiming, \\\"Sure!, there's some one!  I saw him move!  Can any of the soldiers have come to, look for us?\\\"\\n\\nThis was just what her now thoroughly excited crew desired most, as they, could discharge their two broadsides at the same time; and right, gallantly did she fight her way through her numerous foes till she got, up with the American ship, which had been endeavouring to escape before, the wind, and now, to avoid the broadside which the English ship was, about to pour into her, she hauled down her colours.\\n\\nThe lieutenant, singing out for a rope, fastened it round him, though, feeling that he himself would be overpowered before the gallant seaman, could be drawn up.  He succeeded, however, and once more returned to the, deck above.  Still, he knew that a large quantity of powder remained, dry, and that should the fire reach the magazine, the destruction of all, on board would be inevitable.  Although gasping for breath, he was about, again to descend, when a light, active figure, with a rope round his, waist, darted passed him, and he recognised Rayner.  He was about to, follow, when he heard the voice of the midshipman shouting, \\\"Haul me up\\n\\nA bright look-out was kept from the mast-head from sunrise to sunset for, a strange sail, and it was not probable that they would have to go long, without falling in with one, for England had at that time pretty nearly, all the world in arms against her.  She had managed to quarrel with the, Dutch, and was at war with the French and Spaniards, while she had, lately been engaged in a vain attempt to overcome the American colonies\\n\\n\\\"That somebody will never come to claim it,\\\" answered Jack.  \\\"Depend on, it, he's gone to the bottom, or ended his days somehow long ago, or he, would have come back before this.  These goods have been here for, months, or years maybe, by the look of the packages; and depend on it, the owners would not have let them stay where they are, if they could, have come back to fetch them away.\\\"\\n\\npressed most of them, just come in from a long voyage, many months or, perhaps years having passed since they left their native land; that they, did not look especially amiable was not to be wondered at, since they, had been prevented from going, as they had intended, to visit their, friends, or maybe, in the case of the careless ones, from enjoying a, long-expected spree on shore.  They were all now waiting to be inspected, by the first lieutenant, before their names were entered on the ship's, books.\\n\\nAs the men-of-war approached, the merchant vessels, to the number of, nearly fifty, got under way and stood down Channel.  It was pretty hard, work to keep them together, and the corvette was employed in continually, firing signals to urge on the laggers, or to prevent the faster craft, from running out of sight.  What with shortening and making sail and, signalling, together with getting a newly commissioned ship into trim\\n\\nThe progress Jack and his companions made was very small, and it was, evident that unless they could work faster they would be unable to, remove the bar before daylight.  Rayner and Oliver searched round the, room for any pieces of iron which might serve the purpose of a chisel., They examined the bedsteads--they were formed entirely of wood.  There, was, of course, no fireplace, or a poker might have assisted them.  They, had just returned to the window when their ears caught the sounds of a, few low notes from a violin, played almost directly beneath them.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps the captain intends to make you his clerk, or maybe some day, you will become his coxswain,\\\" observed Jack, whose ambition soared no, higher.  \\\"I should like to be that, but I suppose that it is not, necessary to be able to read, or write, or sum.  I never could make any, hand at those things, but you seem up to them, and so it's all right, that you should learn.\\\"\\n\\nAgain left in darkness, they prepared to pass another disagreeable, night.  Rayner felt that their position was critical in the extreme.  He, and his companions, accused as they were of being spies, might be led, out at any moment and shot.  He therefore considered it his duty to, prepare his companions as best he could for the worst.  Oliver he knew, was as ready to die as he was himself.  He spoke earnestly and, faithfully to the others, pointing out the unspeakable importance of, being prepared to stand in the presence of the Judge of all men.  He was, thankful to hear Jack's reply, which expressed the simple hope of the, Christian--faith in Christ as a Saviour; but the other two were silent.\\n\\nThe letter, after being folded several times and creased all over, was, at length closed, sealed, and addressed, by which time it had assumed a, somewhat grimy appearance.  Tom got the cook's mate, who was going on, shore, to post his letter, having told him that he expected to receive a, good sum of money by return, and promising him a part of the proceeds., Bill and Jack looked forward to the reply with almost as much interest, as Tom himself, neither of them feeling that they should be at all, jealous, should it produce the satisfactory result he anticipated.\\n\\nRayner had made up his mind to go out and try to ascertain what had, become of him, or at all events to obtain some food, for he felt that, neither he nor the rest of the party could get through the night when, travelling without it.  Later on it would be still more difficult to, obtain, as the inhabitants would be in bed.  He thought he should be, able to find his way back to their place of concealment; so, desiring, the party to keep perfectly silent, he set out.  He had not gone far in, the wood, when he heard footsteps.  He crouched down behind a tree\\n\\nThe news quickly spread fore and aft that the _Lily_ was to be sent, home.  Loud cheers rose from many a stout throat, the invalids, of which, there were not a few, joining in the chorus from below.  One-third of, those who had come out had either fallen fighting in the many actions in, which she had been engaged, or, struck down by yellow fever, lay in the, graveyard of Port Royal.  No time was lost in getting fresh water and, provisions on board.\\n\\n\\\"The privateer continued her cruise in search of our merchantmen, or any, prizes our ships might have taken.  A more ruffianly set of fellows I, never set eyes on.  My poor men were robbed of everything they had about, them, and I should have had my jacket taken off my back but for the, interference of the officers, who allowed me to mess with them, and to, go on deck whenever I wished.  Considering the style of their, conversation at table, however, I should have thankfully preferred, living by myself.\\n\\nLike his illustrious French contemporary Jean Bart, John Benbow was of, humble origin.  He entered the merchant service when a boy.  He was, unknown till he had reached the age of thirty, when he had risen to the, command of a merchant vessel.  Attacked by a powerful Salee rover, he, gallantly repulsed these Moorish pirates, and took his ship safe into, Cadiz.  The heads of thirteen of the pirates he preserved, and delivered, them to the magistrates of the town, in presence of the custom-house, officers.  The tidings of this strange incident reached Madrid, and the, King of Spain, Charles the Second, sent for the English captain\\n\\nWhen Captain Martin came to muster the shipwrecked men saved by his, exertions, he found that upwards of three hundred of the crew of his, late antagonist had perished, seventy alone having landed in safety., Leaving a party on the beach to watch lest any more should be washed on, shore, he and the magistrate led the way up the cliff.  The Frenchmen, followed with downcast hearts, fully believing that they were to be, treated as prisoners of war.  Some of them, aided by the British seamen\\n\\nBill Rayner had certainly not been born with a silver spoon in his, mouth.  His father he had never known.  His mother lived in a garret and, died in a garret, although not before, happily for him, he was able to, do something for himself, and, still more happily, not before she had, impressed right principles on his mind.  As the poor woman lay on her, deathbed, taking her boy's hands and looking earnestly into his eyes\\n\\nAn hour and a half had passed since the French frigate had opened her, fire, and still the little sloop held out.  Commander Saltwell's great, object was to avoid being run down or boarded.  This he managed to do by, skilful manoeuvring.  At length Rayner, through his glass, observed the, crew of the frigate running about her deck as if in considerable, confusion.  Once more the _Lily_ fired, but what was the astonishment of, the British seamen to see her haul her main-tack aboard and begin to, make all sail, putting her head to the northward.  To follow was, impossible, as the _Lily_ had every brace and bowline, all her after, backstays, several of her lower shrouds, and other parts of her rigging\\n\\nbeen among them, were missing; and though the survivors mourned their, loss, that was not the time either to think or talk about them.  Not a, word, indeed, was spoken fore and aft; not even the usual jokes passed, between the men.  The Frenchman showed no inclination to avoid the, combat.  He could not have got away even had he wished, for his, foretopmast was gone, and he had not fully repaired the other damages he, had received aloft.\\n\\nThey, however, made the fullest examination in their power to ascertain, the best spot for their descent; they looked out of every window in, succession, but at last arrived at the conclusion that the attempt to, scramble down a perpendicular wall was too hazardous to be made.  They, now began to fear that their enterprise must be abandoned, and that they, should be compelled to make their way first to a lower storey, which\\n\\nBill, however, often thought over the matter, and tried to devise some, plan by which he and Jack might manage to get across.  His plans came to, nothing; and, indeed, the Channel where they were was much too wide to, be crossed except in a small vessel or in a large boat.  Jack was, beginning to speak French pretty well, and Bill was able to gabble away, with considerable fluency, greatly to the delight of Jeannette, who was, his usual instructress.  He tried to teach her a little English in, return, but she laughed at her own attempts, and declared that she, should never be able to pronounce so break-jaw a language.\\n\\n\\\"These I brought by the desire of Madame La Roche,\\\" he said.  \\\"She and, her daughters, and their black girls, and old Francois, worked away very, hard to get them finished.  They began the very moment you and the, gendarmes left the house.  It was Mademoiselle Sophie's idea, she's a, clever young lady.  Directly the dresses were completed, Francois and I, started off on horseback, as we knew the road you had taken, I dressed, as you see me, and carrying my fiddle in a bag hung round my neck.  I, was a strolling player once, and belonged to a circus before I became a, sailor, so I was at home on horseback, and I was at home also when, playing my tricks off on the gendarmes.  I have keen wits and strong, nerves, messieurs.  One without the other is of small value.  United\\n\\nThe question was, on which side should they attempt to make their, descent?  On looking through the narrow windows, they observed a gleam, of light coming out below them on one side; probably that was from the, guard-room, and they accordingly fixed on the opposite side, where all, was dark.  They ran no little chance of breaking their necks, but about, that they did not trouble themselves.  If a cat could get up, they, believed that they could get down, by clinging with toes and fingers\\n\\nAs they had found a fire very useful and pleasant, they went down as, close as they could venture to the water, and employed themselves in, collecting all the driftwood and chips they could find.  They agreed, that they would do the same every day, so as to have a good stock of, fuel.  They wanted also to secure some pieces which might serve as, torches, so that they could examine the smugglers' store as they called, it, which they had discovered.\\n\\nTom, as he had made his bed, had to lie on it, as is the case with many, other persons.  Even now, had he written home, he might have had his, position changed, but he thought himself very clever, and had no, intention of letting his father know where he had gone.  The last of the, trio was far more accustomed to salt water than was either of his, companions.  Jack Peek was the son of a West country fisherman.  He had, come to sea because he saw that there was little chance of getting bread, to put into his mouth if he remained on shore.\\n\\nBill, however, first went to the bed, examined the blankets and sheets, and mattress, and found, to his satisfaction, that below all were two, thick pieces of canvas, drawn together by a rope.  The rope, though, rather thin, would, he was satisfied, bear their light weights.  It, might take them half an hour or so to twist the various materials up, into a rope, and altogether would give them one of ample length for, their purpose.\\n\\nA bright look-out was kept for enemies; all hands, from the captain, downwards, being eager to secure another prize, even though they might, have to fight a tough battle to win her.  The captain's orders were to, capture, sink, burn, destroy, or drive on shore any of the enemy's, vessels he could come up with.  With this object in view the _Thisbe_, continued to cruise, now down the Channel, now up again, keeping as much, as possible in sight of the French coast.  She had been some time at, sea, however, without having made any prizes; for although she had, chased several vessels, they, having espied her in time, had managed to, escape by running close in shore, under strong batteries, or getting up, harbours where they could not be followed.  At last one morning, as the, frigate had just made the land, from which she had been standing off, during the night, a sail was seen inside of her--that is, between her, and the French coast, steering to the eastward, apparently bound down, Channel.\\n\\nOn reaching it, there was no appearance of fire or smoke.  It was thus, evident that the seat of the fire was farther forward.  He and his, companions next proceeded to the hold, but the dense smoke compelled, them to beat a retreat, as their throats became affected as if from the, fumes of hot tar.  A second attempt to reach the hold was equally, unsuccessful.  The entire absence of heat, however, convinced them that, the fire could not be in that part of the ship, but that the smoke found, its way through the bulkheads.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been nearly ten days ago when the _Ariel_, to which I, belonged, captured a French brig.  Captain Matson sent me on board to, take her to Port Royal.  We were just in sight of the eastern end of, Jamaica, when a large privateer bore down on us.  We did our best to, escape, but as she sailed two feet to our one, and carried twenty-two, guns, we were compelled to yield, and I and my men were taken on board\\n\\nThe frigate then again stood in, taking care to show no lights, when in, perfect silence the boats shoved off, carrying among them about fifty, officers and men.  Lieutenant Saltwell called Bill aft to take a seat by, his side.  Before leaving the frigate, the captain had directed the, first lieutenant to return should he find the ship so moored as to, render it impossible to bring her out.  Bill, however, told him that he, had observed a vessel at anchor some way below the landing-place, and, that he supposed no large craft could get up higher on account of the, shallowness of the water.  The wind, which had hitherto been east and, north-east, again shifting to the southward, blew directly down the, harbour, which would enable the ship, should she be captured, to be, brought down without difficulty.\\n\\nAfter a considerable time of intense anxiety it was found that the line, was taut.  Ben had, it was supposed, reached the forechains of the, frigate.  Then the question rose, whether he would be able to make, himself understood by the Frenchmen.  One of the men, however, who had, been washed on shore said that he believed one or two people on board, understood English; but it was doubtful whether they were among those, who had already perished.\\n\\nhad no intention of yielding his ship as long as he had a stick standing, to escape with.  Full of men as he now was, he hoped to beat off both, his foes, though he could not expect to capture them in sight of an, enemy's squadron.  As they got nearer, a couple of guns were trained aft, to serve as stern chasers, and every preparation was made to fight for, life and liberty.\\n\\ncould no longer support myself, and once more sank on the raft.  In a, short time, however, we could all distinguish her.  The Frenchmen began, to weep.  Now they expressed their fears that she would pass us; now, they tried to shout for joy at the thoughts of being saved.  I at times, also dreaded lest we should not be observed, but all my doubts vanished, when I made you out to be an English sloop-of-war, and saw you haul up, towards us.\\\"\\n\\nThe day passed, and no enemy appeared.  Next morning, however, a sail, was seen to the northward.  Captain Martin immediately bore up to, ascertain her character.  As the daylight increased, all felt confident, that she was a frigate, and probably French.  The stranger was seen to, be carrying a press of canvas, and apparently steering for Cherbourg., To re-enter that port she must encounter the _Thisbe_, on board which, preparations were made for the expected engagement.  The stranger, too\\n\\n\\\"Come, Jack, stow this away in your inside as fast as you can, that you, may have strength to go on as soon as it is time to start.  We don't, intend to spend our lives here, like mice in a hole.\\\"  Jack did as he, was bid, without asking questions.  Just as he had finished, Tom groaned, out, \\\"I shall die soon if I don't get something to eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was pretty well tired by this time, and had to rest two or three, minutes before I could again venture into the water.  While I was trying, to recover my strength, the man clinging to the log, fancying that no, one was coming, again shrieked out for help.  Once more slipping into, the water, at last by shoving the piece of plank before me, I contrived, to reach him; then getting him to take hold of it, I made my way back to, the raft, when we were both dragged nearly exhausted out of the water.\\n\\nBill now went to the window, and found that the grass came close up to, the walls of the tower underneath.  Even should they fall from a, considerable height, they might have the chance of not breaking their, bones, and that was some satisfaction.  An iron bar extended from the, top of the window to the bottom in the centre.  He felt it, and it was, strong as need be.  It would do well for securing their rope.  As far as, he could judge, there was no window under them.  This was of, consequence, as had there been, they might have been seen by any person, within during their descent, rapidly as they might make it.  Bill, considered whether it would be possible to withdraw the rope after they, had descended, but he doubted whether they had sufficient materials to, enable them to do that.\\n\\nWith the exception of Le Duc they were all soon collected in the room, below.  He had managed by some means to escape detection.  They were, allowed but a short time to take leave of Madame La Roche and her, daughters.  The sergeant having received no orders respecting the, ladies, and satisfied at having secured his prisoners, seemed disposed, to allow the former to remain unmolested.  They looked very melancholy\\n\\n\\\"Don't think about it,\\\" said Bill; \\\"you are safe from further harm, and, will be well taken care of; and when you have recovered, and the war is, over, you will be able to go back.  I must leave you now, but I will, come and see you as often as I can.  I have placed the jug of lemonade, close to your head, where it cannot slip.  When that is gone I will get, some more; it is the best thing you can take at present.\\\"\\n\\nhowever, was covered with several dishes, which, from the fragrant odour, ascending from them, promised to satisfy the hunger of a couple of, midshipmen.  It was difficult to make out the materials of which the, dishes were composed, but on examination it was found that they, consisted chiefly of salt beef and fish dressed in a variety of, fashions, fricasseed, stewed, and grilled, and mixed with an abundance, of vegetables, with some delicious fruit, such as the West Indies can, alone produce.\\n\\nThey forgot all about the smugglers' stores, and their intention of, making clothes for themselves; indeed, they only thought of getting on, board the vessel.  They watched eagerly for the tide to go down.  The, day passed by and the night came on, but the clouds clearing away, a, bright moon shed her light over the scene.  The wind had also sensibly, decreased, and the waves rolled in with far less fury than before.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see that we have not still a chance of coming up with her,\\\", answered Bill.  \\\"The captain thinks so, or he would not be keeping after, her.  Perhaps she may be becalmed closer in with the land, or we may, draw near enough to knock away her masts.  We have gained a mile on her, during the last hour.  I would always try to succeed while a single, chance remains, and I would never knock under to an enemy while I had a, stick standing, or a plank beneath my feet.\\\"\\n\\nhowever, terror-stricken, and thinking only of their own safety, rushed, up the beach, as if fancying that the sea might still overtake them., Tom and his messmate alone remained, and held on to the rope.  Rayner, swam off towards the Frenchman, who was nearest to the shore.  Grasping, him by the shirt, he ordered Tom and Brown to haul him in, and in a few, seconds they succeeded in getting the Frenchman on shore.\\n\\nBill was glad to find that he had not to go back to his own ship, as he, wanted to look after Pierre, and as soon as his duty would allow him he, went below to learn how his young French friend was getting on.  When he, asked for the man whom he had brought down, the doctor pointed to one of, the officer's cabins in the gun-room, observing, \\\"He is somewhat badly, hurt, but there are others still more cruelly knocked about who require, my care, and I have not been able to attend to him for some time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir, I'm sorry to say I have,\\\" answered Jack.  \\\"He has been, knocking about Plymouth, hiding away from the press-gangs in all sorts, of places, instead of going home to his father, as he said he would.  I, only found him last night, and tried to persuade him to join the _Lily_, with me, but he'd still a shiner or two in his locker, and he couldn't, make up his mind to come till the last had gone.  I know where to find, him, and I'll try again after I have entered on board the _Lily_.\\\"\\n\\nAt last they begged leave to go down to see their men.  They were guided, to their rooms by sounds of music and uproarious laughter.  They found, Le Duc seated on a three-legged stool on the top of a table fiddling, away, while old Francois, three black women, Tom and Brown, were dancing, in the strangest possible fashion, whirling round and round, kicking up, their heels, and joining hands, while Jack lay on a bed at the farther, end of the room, looking as if he longed to get up and take a part in, the dance.\\n\\nRayner for some time walked the deck of the little vessel alone.  Jack, was at the helm, and one of the men forward.  The watch was very nearly, out, and he determined not to call up Oliver until daylight.  On looking, to the southward he saw that the mist which had before remained only a, few feet above the horizon was rapidly covering the sky, while beneath, it he distinguished a long line of white foam.\\n\\nIf Tom had any fear, it was not the time to show it.  He heard all, around him speak of fighting as if it were fun, and of death with, seeming levity.  It is the way of the young and the thoughtless.  Old, sailors and old soldiers seldom talk thus, and think more of duty than, of glory.  For young or for old the loss of life is not a matter for, light talk, as if death were only the end of it.  Those that cause war, will have much to reckon for hereafter.  But there is no time for such, thoughts in sight of the enemy.  So we must go on with our story.\\n\\nAt length the entrance to Plymouth Sound was descried, and the _Thisbe_, and her prize stood up it triumphantly with colours flying, creating, considerable astonishment at her quick return with another capture., Both were soon moored in Hamoaze, when the _Atlante_, a fine little, ship, carrying twenty guns on one deck, was handed over to the prize, agents with the full expectation that she would be bought into the, service.  The prisoners were carried on shore, the wounded men were, taken to the hospital, and the prize crew returned on board their own, ship.\\n\\nThe breeze freshened, and the prize in a short time reached the mouth of, the harbour.  No sooner had she done so than the guns from the fort, as, had been expected, opened fire, and their shot, thick as hail, came, crashing on board.  Several men were struck, and the sails shot through, and through.  None of the yards, however, were carried away, and the, canvas stood filled out with the breeze.\\n\\n\\\"Try to keep ahead of her,\\\" answered Bill, glancing round for a moment., \\\"The Frenchmen may not think it worth while to chase us far, even if, they are in chase of us, and that's not certain.  Don't let us cry out, before we are hurt.  Get out the oars, they'll help us on a little, and, we'll do our best to escape.  I don't fancy being shut up again, or, perhaps being carried off to a prison, and forced into a dungeon, or, maybe shot, for they'll declare that we are escaped prisoners.\\\"\\n\\nBill at once put his resolution into practice.  He did not mind wetting, his feet; but he had here and there a hard job to save himself from, being carried off by the sea, which rolled up the beach to the very foot, of the cliff.  Twice he had to cling to a rock, and frequently to wade, for some distance, till he began to regret that he had ventured so soon;, but having made up his mind to do a thing, he was not to be defeated by, the fear of danger; so waiting till the wave had receded, he rushed on, to another rock.  The sky had become overcast.  The leaden seas\\n\\njust as a dog does when a person attempts to take a bone from him.  He, had managed to gulp down the larger portion before the others could, snatch the prize from him.  The next moment he sank back, and never, spoke again.  I saw no violence used, except the force they exerted to, take the fragments of the fish from his hands.  It appeared to me as if, one of them had stabbed him, so suddenly did he fall.\\n\\n\\\"Why, if they leave us here long enough, the next thing that will happen, will be that we'll make our way out again,\\\" replied Bill.  \\\"Look at, those windows!  Though they are not very big, they are large enough for, us to squeeze through, or it may be more convenient to make our way out, by the roof.  I can see daylight through one or two places, which shows, that the tiles are not very securely fastened on.\\\"\\n\\nAs they went along, Le Duc said, \\\"When I got near the village I met an, old black, who told me there were no strangers in the place, and that I, might easily procure what I wanted.  I accordingly went on boldly, until, I reached a cottage just in the outskirts.  I entered and found the, people ready enough to sell me some bread and sausages, charging me, three times as much as they were worth.  I also procured this straw bag, to put them in.  While I was there packing them up several persons who, had come in were talking, and I heard them say that a party of soldiers, had just arrived, on their way from Leogane to Port Saint Louis in the, bay, and that they were ordered to look out for several English spies\\n\\n\\\"I don't quite like the look of the weather,\\\" observed Bill one day to, Jack, just before the time Jeannette was due at the little cave, and all, their provisions were expended.  \\\"If it comes on very bad she may be, stopped, and we shall be pressed.  I'll slip down the moment the water, is shallow enough, and try to get along the shore; and if she has not, reached the cave, I'll go on and meet her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have an idea,\\\" cried Bill.  \\\"It's an ill wind that brings no one good, luck.  If we can manage to get on board that craft which has come on, shore, we might build a boat out of her planking, or at all events a, raft; and should the wind come from the southward, we might manage to, get across the Channel, or be picked up by some vessel or other.  We are, pretty sure to find provisions on board.  Perhaps one of her boats may, have escaped being knocked to pieces, and we could repair her.  At all, events, it will be our own fault if that wreck doesn't give us the, opportunity of escaping.\\\"\\n\\nregardless of that of their late shipmates, hurried into eternity.  In, vain I tried to arouse them.  Now and then one would look at me with an, ominous glance, and I confess I began to fear, as night drew on, that I, should not be allowed to see another day dawn.  I stood up, though it, was with difficulty that I could steady myself, for my strength was, already failing.  Anxiously I looked round the horizon.  The sky had, hitherto been clear; but, as I cast my eye to the eastward, I observed a, cloud rising rapidly.  Another and another followed.  They came on, directly towards us, discharging heavy drops of rain.  My fear was that, they would empty themselves before they reached us.  The looks of my, companions brightened.\\n\\nlocking the cottage door after him, and hung the key on a hook in a tree, in the garden.  Many years passed before he returned to the old place., Though now out of his reach, for the tree had grown faster than he, the, key still hung on the hook.  He left it there; and there it remained, when he came back as Rear-Admiral of the _White_.  He then pointed it, out to his friends, and told the story.  Once more his country required, his services, but his fame and the echo of his victories alone came over, the wave.  The good town of Shrewsbury is proud to claim him as a son\\n\\nThey now proceeded towards the house, led by Le Duc.  The two officers, going first, they mounted the steps, and getting inside the house, they, saw an old mulatto carrying a couple of wax candles.  He beckoned them, with his head to follow, and led the way to an inner room, when an old, lady advanced to meet them.  Behind her came two young ladies, whom the, midshipmen thought very handsome, with dark flashing eyes and black, tresses, their costumes being light and elegant, and suited to that warm, clime.  The old lady introduced them as her daughters, Sophie and, Virginie.  The midshipmen advanced bowing, and Rayner, who was, spokesman, apologised for appearing in their wet and somewhat torn, clothes.\\n\\n\\\"Don't talk of that, my lad; if it hadn't been for your courage and, coolness I should not have been here.  I am now going on shore, and wish, you to accompany me.  I have seen the widow of an old shipmate of mine, who is willing to receive Pierre into her house, and to attend to him., We will have him removed at once, so that when we sail you will know he, is placed under good care.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I cannot agree with you as to the chance of getting off,\\\" he observed., \\\"As soon as the wreck is seen, the Frenchmen are sure to be down on the, shore, and we shall be caught and carried back to prison instead of, getting away.  The boats are pretty certain to have been knocked into, shreds before this, and as to building a boat, that is what neither you, nor I can do, even if we had the tools, and where are they to come, from?\\\"\\n\\nThis book was written for \\\"Boy's Own Paper\\\" shortly after that magazine, started.  The plan was to write a book illustrating how it might be, possible for any very ordinary little boy joining the Navy in the lowest, rating--powder monkey--and ascend to the very highest rank--admiral.  It, had been done before, in the separate cases of Benbow and Hopson, and, there was no reason why it shouldn't happen again.  A powder monkey was, so called because his job in manning the guns was to run from time to, time to fetch more powder whenever it was needed.  Since the boys were, small they afforded little target for the enemy's shot, so they tended, to survive an engagement.  Just as well, for their job was, indispensable.\\n\\nJack was still asleep.  He was breathing easily, and appeared to be, better; but still it was not probable that he would be able to continue, the journey.  It would be necessary, therefore, at all events, to remain, in the cavern all the day, but should he be well enough they might, continue their journey at nightfall.  Their chief difficulty would be to, procure food from the neighbouring village without exciting suspicion.\\n\\nMeantime, every possible exertion was made to get the ship ready for, sea.  Mr Saltwell was very busy superintending all the operations., Bill, however, found that he was not forgotten, from a kind word or two, which on several occasions the first lieutenant bestowed upon him.  As, Tom was not aware of this, he amused himself by telling Bill that Mr, Saltwell would not trouble himself more about him--that he must be, content to remain a powder monkey until he got big enough to be rated as, an ordinary seaman.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ay, sir,\\\" answered Rayner, very well pleased to have a separate, command, although it might only last a few hours.  He was still more, pleased, however, when the boat came back, bringing Oliver Crofton, the, four Frenchmen, and Jack and Tom, to form part of his crew.  The blacks, and the mulatto were kept on board to assist in working the schooner., The mulatto said he was the steward, and one of the blacks, with a low, bow, introduced himself as the cook.\\n\\nThe cargo had, however, to be got on board, consisting of the three, chests, which, of course, would bring it down somewhat.  They lowered, one after the other, and lashed them in the positions they had intended., The foremost chest was secured over all by ropes, as that had not to be, opened, and was to serve only as a step for their mast; the other two, chests were secured by their handles both fore and aft and athwartships\\n\\nRayner, having now committed himself to the care of Heaven, prepared to, swim off to the wreck.  He knew that Oliver would see him coming, and, would be ready to help him get on board.  Waiting until a sea had broken, on the beach, he followed it out, and darting through the next which, rolled forward, he was soon a long way from the shore.  He found he, could swim much better than before, now that he had no rope to carry., Boldly he struck forward.  Happily he did not recollect that those seas, swarmed with sharks.  On and on he went.  Now and again, as a sea rushed, over the reef, he was thrown back, but exerting all his strength, he, struggled forward.  He was nearing the wreck, and could see that Oliver\\n\\n\\\"There's no use talking about that.  We must run the risk,\\\" observed, Bill; \\\"so here goes.\\\"  And he forthwith turned back the coverlid, and, began measuring the sheets.  They were of strong and tough material, and, by dividing each into four lengths, he calculated that a rope formed of, them would be of sufficient strength for their purpose, and they were, quickly cut through with their knives, and each length was then twisted, tightly up.\\n\\nThe _Foxhound_ had for some days been cruising in the Bay of Biscay, and, was one morning about the latitude of Ferrol.  The watch was employed in, washing down decks, the men and boys paddling about with their trousers, tucked up to their knees, some with buckets of water, which they were, heaving about in every direction, now and then giving a shipmate, when, the first lieutenant's eye was off them, the benefit of a shower-bath:, others were wielding huge swabs, slashing them down right and left, with, loud thuds, and ill would it have fared with any incautious landsman who, might have got within their reach.  The men were laughing and joking, with each other, and the occupation seemed to afford amusement to all, employed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
