He had the misfortune to show his, worst side to most people, and he had shown it to her. She had seen more, than once that he was ready to undertake and carry out almost anything, for his friend's sake, and she had been honestly grateful to him for all, he had done. But she had not been able, until now, to shake off that, feeling of distrust and timid dislike she had always felt in his, presence. She had, indeed, succeeded tolerably well in hiding it from, him, but it had always made her cold in conversation and somewhat formal, in manner, and he, being outwardly a rather formal and cold man had, so, to say, put himself in harmony with her key. For the first time in their, acquaintance, and under pressure of what he considered necessity, he had, suddenly unbent, and had told her the principal story of his life with a, frankness and simplicity that had charmed her. From that hour she judged, him differently. After that first visit, he went often to see her, and, on each occasion he felt drawn more closely to her than before.\\n\\nBut his manliness rose up at this and smote his cynicism out of the, field for a time. That little he owed Maddalena, at least--he could not, do less than defend her, at whatever cost, and he knew well enough that, he always would. As for his wish that she might know it, that was, nothing but his own detestable vanity. For his own part, he wished with, all his heart that the next morning might end his existence. He had, never valued his life very highly, and of late it had been so little to, his taste that he was more than ready to part with it, even violently., The future did not appall him, although, strangely enough, he was very, far from being an unbeliever, and had been brought up to consider a, sudden end, in mortal sin, as the most horrible and irreparable of, misfortunes. To him, in his experience of himself, no imaginable, suffering could be worse than the self-doubt, the self-contempt, and the, self-hatred which had so often tormented him during the past years. If, he were to be punished for his misdeeds with the same torture, even, though it were to be never-ending, at least he should bear the pain of, it alone, such as it was, without the necessity for hiding it and for, going through the daily mummery of life with an indifferent face. And in, that state there would be no more temptation of the kind he feared. What, he had done up to the hour of death would close the chronicle of evil\\n\\n\\\"I shall be very sincerely grateful for anything you can do to help the, wife of my old friend,\\\" he said. \\\"And I think you can do a good deal., You have great influence in the gay set--and that means the people who, talk the most--Donna Adele, Donna Maria Boccapaduli, the Marchesa di San, Giacinto, and all the rest, who are, more or less, your intimates. It is, very good of you to help me--Lady Herbert needs all the help she can, get. Spicca is a useful man, too. If he can be prevailed upon to say, something particularly witty at the right moment, it will do good.\\\"\\n\\nthe men had been circumspect in their remarks, but there were few who, did not make the sign when they saw her go by. If anything had been, needed to prove the fact, there was the issue of the duel. The man who, had taken Laura's side had nearly lost his life, though he had fought, several times previously without ever receiving any serious hurt. That, was proof positive. Adele's illness, too, dated almost from the day of, her reconciliation with Laura, and seemed likely to end fatally. Then\\n\\nGerano was obliged to admit that there was truth in this, though his, instinct told him that Ghisleri should be heard before being accused. He, was one of those men whose faith being once shaken is not easily, re-established, and he could not forget that his daughter had once, deceived him, a fact with which Savelli was now also acquainted, since, Adele had told him the whole truth about that part of the story, but to, which he attached relatively little importance as compared with, Ghisleri's villanous conduct in attempting to extort money from a member, of the Savelli family.\\n\\nShe walked again on that day, and by an almost superhuman effort kept, up appearances until bedtime, even succeeding in eating a moderately, abundant dinner. That night she told Lucia that, on the whole, she would, prefer to keep her, that she had always been more than satisfied with, her services, and that if she had suddenly felt an aversion to her, it, was the result of the extreme nervousness she had suffered of late. Now, that she could sleep, she realised how unkind she had been. Lucia humbly, thanked her, and said that she hoped to live and die in the service of, the most excellent Casa Savelli. Thereupon Adele thanked her too, said, very sweetly that she was a good girl and would some day be rewarded by, finding a good husband, and ended by giving her five francs. She, reflected that to give her more might look like the beginning of a, course of bribery, and that to give nothing might be construed as, proceeding from the fear of seeming to bribe.\\n\\nthe readiness to go to any length for the sake of real passion, the, power to hate honestly, to love faithfully, and to forgive wholly--all, things which Pietro missed in himself. And Laura had to-day waked the, memory of that great love which had once filled his existence, and which, had not ended with the life that had gone out before its day, in all its, beauty and freshness. He was grateful to her for that, and he sat long, in his chair after his lonely meal, thinking of her and of the other\\n\\nAnd she went on to give him an account of the baby life that so wholly, absorbed her thoughts. Ghisleri listened quietly as though he understood, it all. He wished, indeed, that it were possible to talk of something, else, and he felt something like a sensation of pain as Laura constantly, called the child \\\"Herbert,\\\" just as she had formerly been used to speak, of her husband. Nevertheless, he was conscious also of a certain sense, of satisfaction. During the month which had elapsed she had learned to, hide her great trouble under the joy of early motherhood. There was, something very beautiful in her devotion to the child of her sorrow, and, hurt though Ghisleri was by her manner to him, she seemed more lovely, and more admirable than ever in his eyes. He said so when he went to see, Maddalena dell' Armi late in the afternoon.\\n\\nMrs. Carlyon was very poor when she came to Rome. Her husband had been a, careless, good-humoured, and rather reckless younger son, and when he, broke his neck in coming down the Gross Glockner he left his widow about, as much as men of his stamp generally leave to their families; to wit, a, fearful and wonderful confusion of unpaid debts and a considerable, number of promises to pay money, signed by persons whose promises were, not of much consequence, even when clearly set down on paper. It seems, to be a peculiarity of poor and good-natured men that they will lend, whatever money they have to impecunious friends in distress rather than, use it for the paying of the just debts they owe their tailors.\\n\\nAdele looked very ill. By this time her complexion was of a pale, yellow, and she was thin to absolute emaciation. In spite of her, determined efforts to break the habit that was killing her, or perhaps, as a first consequence of them, she was liable to moments of nervousness, in which she could hardly control herself and in which she did not seem, to remember what had happened a few minutes earlier. Her sufferings at, such times were painful to see. She could hardly keep her hands from, moving about in a helpless fashion, and her face was often slightly, contorted. Very rarely, on fine days when she had been driving, a little, colour came into her ghastly cheeks. It was easy to see that only her, strong will supported her continually, and that women more weakly, organized would long ago have succumbed to the effects of the poison.\\n\\nLord Herbert and Laura lived in blissful ignorance of what was said, about them. The preparations for the wedding were already begun, and, Laura's modest trousseau was almost all ordered. She and Arden had, discussed their future, and having realised that they must live in a, very economical fashion for the present and so long as it pleased Heaven, to preserve Arden's maternal uncle among the living, they decided that, the wedding should be as quiet and unostentatious as possible. The old, Prince, however, though far too conscientious to have settled a penny of, his inherited fortune upon Laura, even if she had chosen to marry a, pauper, was not ungenerous in other ways, and considered himself at, liberty to offer the pair some very magnificent silver, which he was, able to pay for out of his private economies. As for Donna Adele, she, presented them with a couple of handsome wine-coolers--doubtless in, delicate allusion to the fictitious story about the champagne Lord, Herbert was supposed to have taken. The implied insult, if there was, any, was not at all noticed by those who had never heard the tale\\n\\nThe surgeon was surprised by something else in the case. As a general, rule, when a man fights a desperate duel in the very middle of the, season, and especially such a man as he knew Ghisleri to be, and is, severely hurt, he finds himself cut off from society in the midst of, some chain of events in which the whole present interest of his life is, engaged. He is consequently disturbed in mind, impatient of confinement\\n\\nfor love told his own tale plainly. Yet it seemed to him now that if he, had then thought Bianca as cold as he had reason to believe that Laura, was, he might have resigned himself to his fate at the beginning--he, might not have found the strength he now had to risk such a defeat as, perhaps waited him, to run any danger, now that he was free, rather than, live in suspense another day.\\n\\n, It was a relief to be with Laura Arden again for an hour on the day, after his return, as Ghisleri felt when he was installed beside her in, the chair which had come to be regarded as his. She received him just as, usual, and he saw at once that if she had at all resented his visit to, Adele, she was not by any means inclined to let him know it. There was a, freshness and purity in the atmosphere that surrounded her which, especially appealed to him after his visit to Gerano. Whatever she said, she meant, and if she meant anything she took no trouble to hide it. He, compared her face with her step-sister's, and the jaded, prematurely, world-worn look of the one threw the calm beauty of the other into, strong relief. He felt no pity for Adele. What she was, she had made, herself, and if she suffered, it was as the direct and inevitable, consequence of the life she had led and of the things she had done. So\\n\\n, The season had begun, but Pietro Ghisleri had little heart for going, into the world. Apart from the very sad scenes of which he had been a, witness so recently, he really mourned the loss of his friend with a, sincerity for which few would have given him credit. It would, of, course, have been an exaggeration to act as though Arden had been his, brother and to cast himself off from society for several months; but, during a fortnight after he had laid Lord Herbert in the Protestant, Cemetery at Monte Testaccio, he was seen nowhere. He went, indeed, to, the house of the Contessa dell' Armi, but he made his visits at hours, when no one else was received, as everybody knew, and he consequently, saw none of his acquaintances except in the street. Twice daily at, first, and then once, he went to the door of the Tempietto and sent up, for news of Laura and the child. Strange to say, after the first three, or four days the news became uniformly good. Ghisleri learned that the, little boy had come into the world sound and strong at all points\\n\\nThe sick man was unconscious and lay quite still on his back with closed, lids. The sister was on her feet, watching him intently. She shook her, head sadly when Ghisleri looked at her. The end was not far off, as she, in her great experience well knew. In hot haste Pietro sent for the, doctor, with a message saying that Lord Herbert was dying. But when he, came he admitted reluctantly that he could do nothing; there was no hope, even of prolonging life until morning.\\n\\nLaura hesitated a moment, and then slipped a five franc note with her, card into an envelope and addressed it as requested in the letter. On, the next day but one she received a second, full of gratitude, and, expressing the most humble and sincere thanks for the money, but not, asking for anything more. This also was copied from a genuine, communication, and the style was unmistakably the same. Adele had, answered the first by sending a larger sum than Laura had given, in, order that the reply might be relatively effusive.\\n\\nfor she had a good constitution and had rarely even had a headache. In, figure she was well proportioned, of average height and rather strongly, made, with large, firm, well-shaped hands. On the whole, a graceful, girl, but not in that way remarkable among others of her own age. In her, face, and altogether in her presence, the chief attraction lay in the, look of her eyes, which made one forget to notice the well-chiselled, nose,--a little short perhaps,--the really beautiful mouth, and the, perfect teeth. The chin, too, was broad and firm--too firm, some might, have said, for one so young. Considering all these facts together, most, people agreed that Laura was not far from being a great beauty.\\n\\nthrough the lovely gardens of Corfu. They ran in fair weather up to the, lagoons of Venice, and wandered in a gondola through the wide canals and, narrow water lanes of the most beautiful city in the world. Then down, the long Adriatic again, past Zara and Xanthe, round Matapan to the, Piraeus--then, when they had had their fill of Athens, away by one long, run to Sicily again, to Algiers next, and then to Barcelona and the, Spanish coast, homeward bound at last, towards England. For the weather, was growing warm now, and Laura noticed that she saw less often in, Arden's face the colour she had watched with such pleasure during the, first weeks. There was no cause for anxiety, she thought, but it was, possible that he needed always an even temperature, neither cold nor, hot, and it was time to reach England, before the July sun had scorched, the southern land.\\n\\nGhisleri laughed to himself, and at himself, as he went away, for being, so much impressed as he was by what Laura said. But he could not deny, that the impression had been made and remained for some time after he, had left her. There was a healthy common-sense about her mind which was, beginning to act upon the tortuous and often morbid complications of his, own. She seemed to know the straight paths and the short cuts to simple, goodness, and never to have guessed at the labyrinthine ways by which he, seemed to himself to be always trying to escape from the bugbear sent to, pursue him by the demon of self-mistrust. He laughed at himself, for he, realised how utterly impossible it would always be for him to think as, she did, or to look upon the world as she saw it. There had been a time, when he had thought more plainly, when a woman had exerted a strong, influence over him, and when a few good things and a few bad ones had, made up the sum of his life. But she was dead, and he had changed. Worse, than that, he had fallen. As he sat in his room and glanced from time to, time at the only likeness he had of Bianca Corleone, he thought of, Beatrice's reproach to Dante in the thirty-first canto of the, \\\"Purgatory\\\":\\n\\nThereupon Ghisleri passed on, inwardly wondering how long it would be, before Adele became quite mad. Two days later he received a note from, her. She had heard from her husband that he was in Rome, she said, and, wrote to ask a great favour of him. He was doubtless aware of her, father's passion for manuscripts, which was well known in Rome. It was, reported that a certain dealer had bought Prince Montevarchi's library, after the crash, and she very much wished to buy a very interesting, manuscript of which she had often heard her father speak, and which, contained an account of the famous, or infamous, Isabella Montevarchi's, life, written with her own hand--a sort of confession, in fact. As she, did not know the exact title of the document, if it had any, she would, call it a confession, though, of course, in a strictly lay sense. Now\\n\\n\\\"Send me Giacomo,\\\" said Adele, holding the letter in her hand, but as, Lucia went towards the door, she stopped her. \\\"No,\\\" she said suddenly., \\\"Take this to him yourself; tell him to have it registered at once, and, to bring me back the receipt from the post-office. Tell him to be, careful, as it is very important. I am going to lie down. Come to me, some time before sunset.\\\"\\n\\nthough its greater light had gone out. The anguish, the agonising, anxiety, the first moment's joy, and at last the full pride of, motherhood, had come between her and the past, deadening the terrible, shock at first, and making the memory of it less keen and poignant, afterwards, while not in any way dimming the bright recollection of the, love that had united her to her husband. She could take pleasure now in, looking forward to her boy's coming years, to the time when he should be, at first a companion, then a friend, and then a protector of whom she, would be proud when he stood among other men. She could think of his, schooldays, and she could already feel the pain of parting from him and, the joy of meeting him again, taller and stronger and braver at every, return. And far away in the hazy distance before her she could see a, shadowy but lovely figure, yet unknown to-day--Herbert's wife that was, to be, a perfect woman, and worthy of him in all ways. It might be also, that somewhere there were great deeds for Herbert to do, fame for him to, achieve, glory for him to win. All this was possible, but she thought, little of it. Her ambition was to know him some day to be all that his, father had been in heart, and to see him all that his father should have, been in outward form and stature. More than that she neither hoped nor, asked for, and perhaps it was enough. And so she dreamed on, while no, one thought she was dreaming at all, for she was always active and busy, with something that concerned the child, and her attention never, wandered when it was needed.\\n\\nand to tell her so, if he chose. No one could blame him for wishing to, marry her; at most he might be thought foolish for desiring anything so, very improbable as that she should accept him. But he was quite, indifferent to what any one might think of him excepting Laura herself., One resolution only he made and did his best to keep, and it was a good, one. He made up his mind that he would not make love to her, as he, understood the meaning of the term. Possibly, as he told himself with a, little scorn, this was no resolution at all, but only a way of, expressing his conviction that he was quite unable to do what he so, magnanimously refused to attempt. For his instinct told him that his, love for Laura had already taken a shape which differed wholly from all, former passions, one unfamiliar to him, one which would need a new, expression if it continued to be sincere. But that he doubted. He was, quite ready to admit that when Laura came back in the autumn, this early, beginning of love would have disappeared again, and that the old strong, friendship would be found in its place, solid, firmly based, and, unchanged, a permanent happiness and a constant satisfaction. He was no, longer a boy, to imagine that the first breath of love was the, forerunner of an all-destroying storm in which he must perish, or of a, clear, fair wind before which the ship of his life was to run her, straight course to the haven of death's peace. He had seen too much, fickleness in himself and in others to believe in any such thing; but if, he had anticipated either it would have been the tempest. On the whole\\n\\nand he would not hear of her accompanying him on any condition. He, assured her that with his fur coat, and in a closed carriage with a, foot-warmer, he was as safe as at home in the drawing-room, and he gave, her to understand that he had a small surprise in store for her, of, which all the effect would be spoiled if she went with him. Very, reluctantly she let him go. Even after he was gone, when she heard the, brougham rattling down the Via Gregoriana, she was tempted to open the, window and call the driver back. Then she reflected that she was, probably foolish in being so anxious, since he now seemed almost as well, as ever.\\n\\nHe was hard to catch. So far as she could learn, he had changed his mode, of life very considerably during the past two years. It was quite, certain that he had definitely broken with Maddalena dell' Armi, though, no one was really sure of the exact date at which the rupture had taken, place. They were both clever people who kept their secrets to themselves, on the simple plan that, if a thing is not to be known, it should not be, told. Laura was the only other woman whom he visited regularly, and his, doings were far too well known to make it possible to float a scandal, about him in connexion with some one else, which should reach Laura's, ears. Besides, Laura would not care. She was quite capable of not taking, the slightest notice, just as in former times she had not cared whether, he saw Maddalena every day or not. All she wanted, thought Adele, was, that Ghisleri should be at her feet--and there he was.\\n\\nBut as chance would have it, the Contessa found herself talking to San, Giacinto one evening, when she was feeling very lonely and unhappy, and, her half-formed resolution broke down as suddenly as it had presented, itself. The giant looked at her keenly for a moment, bent his heavy, black brows, and then told her the story of what had taken place at the, club. He, who saw most things, and talked little of them, noted the, gradual change in her face, and how the light came back to it while he, was speaking. She understood that the man whom she had accused of, betraying his friend had faced a roomful of men in his defence, and on, the very ground now under discussion, and she repented of what she had, done. Then she swore vengeance on Adele Savelli.\\n\\n\\\"That is always a most disagreeable position,\\\" she said boldly. \\\"We were, talking about it the other day. I wish you had been there. Gouache was, telling a foreigner--Prince Durakoff, I think it was--the old story of, how Prince Montevarchi was murdered by his own librarian because he, would not pay the man a sum of money in the way of blackmail. You know, it, of course. The two families, the Montevarchi and the Saracinesca\\n\\n\\\"Very easily. You can understand it too. When I knew that I loved you, I, knew--I believed, at least, that another suffering had been found for, me, as though I had not enough already. Of course, I was hopeless. How, could I tell, how could any one guess that you--you of all women--with, your beauty, your youth, your splendid woman's heart--could ever care, for me? Oh, my darling--dear, dearest--is there no other word? If I, could only tell you half!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could have done it quite as well yourself, only I knew you would, not do it at all,\\\" answered the latter. \\\"I have no scruples in dealing, with such people, nor do I see why any one should have any. But you, would have gone delicately and presented Donna Adele with the, confession, and then when she had burned it before your eyes, you would, have told her that you trusted to her sense of justice to right you in, the opinion of the world.\\\"\\n\\nespecially as regards your taste in sin, which was perfect and perhaps, is still. But marriage is not at all artistic, my dear Ghisleri, until, it becomes unhappy, and the husband goes about with a revolver in every, pocket, and the wife with a scent bottle full of morphia in hers, and, they treat each other with distant civility in private, and with, effusive affection when a third person is present, especially the third, person who has contributed the most to producing the artistic effect in, question. Then the matter becomes interesting.\\\"\\n\\nthough Pietro was looking better than in the afternoon. The two had, evidently been dancing together, for the Contessa's white neck heaved a, little, as though she were still out of breath. She was a short, slight, woman of exquisite figure, very fair, with deep violet eyes and small, classic features, almost hard in their regularity; evidently wilful and, dominant in character. Arden watched the pair as they went on in search, of a vacant sofa just big enough for two.\\n\\nIn the early summer Laura and her husband were at Torre de' Ghisleri in, the Tuscan hills. The small castle was very habitable as compared with, its former condition, and small as it was by comparison with such, fortresses as Gerano, was by no means the mere ruined tower which many, people supposed it to be. The square grey keep from which it took its, name was flanked by a mass of smaller buildings, irregular and of, different epochs, all more or less covered with ivy or with creepers now, in bloom. The wide castle yard, in the midst of which stood the ancient, well with its wonderfully wrought yoke of iron, its heavy chain, and its, two buckets, had been converted into a garden long ago for the bride of, some Ghisleri of those days, and the plants and trees had run almost, wild for a hundred years, irregularly, as some had survived and others, had perished in the winter storms. Here a cypress, there an oak, further, on again three laurels, of the Laura Regia kind, side by side in a row\\n\\n\\\"It is very simple. I think that no love is worth the name which does, not influence a man strongly for at least ten years. Any really great, passion will do that. But human life is short. Let a man fall in love at, twenty, and three periods of ten years each will bring him to fifty. A, man who falls in love after he is fifty is a rarity, and generally an, object of ridicule. That seems to me a logical demonstration, and I do, not see why it should not apply to a woman as well as to a man.\\\"\\n\\nin his imagination, every conceivable expedient by which he fancied that, he might enjoy Laura's society without compromising her in any way. In, such cases, however, it is hard to find a stratagem which shall at once, satisfy the exigencies of the situation, and an honest man's conscience, and sense of honour. He had long given up the custom of going to see, Laura every other day, and when she was at her mother's house he was, rarely invited, on account of the Princess's prejudice against him, and, which no good conduct on his part seemed capable of destroying. To give, up seeing Laura altogether was a sacrifice so great that he did not feel, strong enough to make it; nor, perhaps, would Laura herself have, understood it. Yet, unless he kept away from her for a long time, he, knew that the all-wise world would continue to say that he saw her, every day. The more he thought about it, the harder he found it to come, to any decision. Considering the terms on which he now saw her, and that, in former times they had more than once spoken of the same matter, he at, last reluctantly resolved to lay the question before her, and to let her, decide what he should do. He hated to ask advice of any one, and he, detested even the appearance of shifting responsibility upon another., But he could see no other way.\\n\\nFor the third time since Arden's death the conviction came upon him that, Adele had been the responsible cause of it, and this time it was, destined to be permanent. The theory of coincidence was exhausted, and, he abandoned it. The stories he had told her about Professor, Wuesterschinder, the great German authority, were quite true, and, Ghisleri's eyes had been opened on the previous evening to the, possibilities of evil disclosed by modern science. He was not yet sure, of what Adele had done, but he was convinced that the general nature of, the process she had employed to communicate the fever to Arden was, similar to those which the professor had described, and that she must\\n\\nwas looking somewhat haggard and weary, and the Contessa met the world, that evening with a stony stare. There was endless matter for, speculation, and accordingly the world speculated without end, and, as, usual, to no purpose. Ghisleri was absolutely reticent, and Maddalena, was a very proud woman, who, in spite of her past sufferings, did her, best not to let any one suspect that she and her husband were on bad, terms. She was also unhappy in the present about a very different, matter, concerning which she was not inclined to speak with any one., Donna Adele's last decided attempt to defame Lord Herbert Arden had, to, a certain extent, been successful, but it had also produced another, result of which Adele did not know, but which would have given her even, greater satisfaction. It had almost caused a quarrel between Ghisleri, and the Contessa.\\n\\nand was not above making use of them. Probably some part of the effect, produced by Laura's eyes was due to the evenly perfect whiteness of her, skin and the straight black brows which divided them from the broad low, forehead. For her hair grew low, and she wore it in a simple fashion, without that abundance of little curls which even then were considered, almost essential to woman's beauty. Her pallor, too, was quite natural\\n\\nAs soon as her mother was gone, Laura wrote a note to Pietro, telling, him that she had heard all the story, that she believed in him as firmly, as ever, and begging him to come and see her on the following day at the, usual hour. The last words dropped from her pen naturally. It seemed but, yesterday that they had spoken of meeting \\\"at the usual hour\\\" on the, morrow of the day after that. Ghisleri's heart beat faster as he broke, the seal, and when he came to the words he was conscious that its, beating annoyed him. He knew, now, that he loved her well, as he had, loved but once before in his life. But he determined that he would not, go and see her. He blessed her for believing in his innocence, but there, were many strong reasons against his going to her house, or even seeing, her. Merely on general grounds he would have kept away, while under the, accusation which hung over him, as even the Princess of Gerano had, anticipated that he would, and feeling as he did that he loved her in, good earnest, it would have seemed absolutely dishonourable to renew, their former relations until he had cleared himself. He wrote her a, short note.\\n\\nshe inquired, would Ghisleri, for old friendship's sake, try to obtain, it for her at a reasonable price? She knew, of course, that such an, original would be expensive, but she was prepared to discuss the terms, if not wholly beyond her means. She sent her note by the carrier, as, that was generally quicker than writing by the post, she said. Would, Ghisleri kindly answer by the same means? The man would call again on, the next day but one. That would perhaps give time to make preliminary, inquiries. With which observation, and with best thanks in anticipation, of the service he was about to render, Adele called herself most, sincerely his.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he took care that we should be, by killing all the other branches, of the family. Those hollows in the stone are supposed to have been made, by his footsteps. Think what a walk! It lasted eighteen years. But it is, an airy place and not damp. Those windows were there then, they say. Do, you see that deep channel in the wall? It leads straight up through the, castle to the floor of the little passage between the old guard-room, and one of the towers. There used to be a trap-door--it was still there, when I was a little girl, but my father has had a slab of stone put down, instead. They used to entice their dearest and most familiar enemies up, there, and just as the man set foot on the board a soldier in the tower, pulled a bolt in the wall and the trap-door fell. It is two hundred, feet, they say. It was so cleverly managed! They say that the last, person who came to grief there was a Monsignor Boccapaduli in the year, sixteen hundred and something, but no one ever knew what had become of, him until the next generation.\\\"\\n\\nand hated Laura Arden for being the evil-eyed cause of all his, misfortunes. How could he still go to see her, knowing, as he must, how, dangerous it was? Had she not almost killed him and Adele, as well as, quite killing her husband? People who touched Laura Arden's hand would, do well to shut themselves up and lie safe at home for four and twenty, hours, until the power of the jettatura was past. Those black eyes of, hers meant no good to any one, in spite of her inspired, nun-like looks.\\n\\ncould he have seen her pale and tear-stained face as she sat motionless, in the place where he had left her, he might possibly have been weak, enough to yield, strong as his determination was not to do so. But that, sight was spared him, and he was glad that he had held his peace when, she had paused to give him an opportunity of speaking. It was far better, so. To act a miserable play with her, no matter from what so-called, honourable motive of consideration, would be to make her life far more, unhappy than it would ultimately be if she knew the truth. He was, satisfied with what he had done, therefore, when he went back to his, rooms and lay down to rest after the fatigue of his first day out. But, the meeting had left a very sad and painful impression, and all that he, felt of remorse and regret for what he had done was doubled now. He, hated to think that by his fault she was cast upon the world, with, little left to save her, \\\"trying to amuse herself,\\\" as she had said, and, he wondered at her gentleness and kindness to himself, so different from, her behaviour at their last meeting. That, at least, comforted him. In a, woman who could thus forgive there must be depths of goodness which, would ultimately come to the surface. He remembered how often he had, thought her hard, unjust, unkind, and, above all, unbelieving, in the, days that succeeded the first outbursts of unreasoning love, and how\\n\\nHis first step was to find out the name of the dealer who had bought the, Montevarchi library. He next ascertained that what Adele wanted was, still unsold, and that he must therefore necessarily enter into, correspondence with her. After that he sought out a young lawyer whom he, had employed once or twice within the last few years when he had needed, legal advice in regard to some trifling point, and laid the whole matter, before him. This young man, Ubaldini by name, had rapidly acquired a, reputation as a criminal lawyer, and had successfully defended some, remarkable cases, but, as he justly observed, acquitted prisoners of the, classes in which crimes are common, pay very little, and condemned, criminals pay nothing at all. He was therefore under the necessity of, taking other kinds of business as a means of support. The last murderer, who had escaped the law by Ubaldini's eloquence had sent him a bag of, beans and a cream cheese, which was all the family could afford in the, way of a fee, but upon which a barrister who had a taste for variety, could not subsist any length of time.\\n\\nconsidering that for years they had met and acted with perfectly civil, indifference towards one another. Nevertheless, he relit his cigarette, which had gone out, and made a step towards the other side of the room., To Campodonico, the calm expression of his face seemed like scorn, and, he became exasperated in a moment. He called the other back. They were, at some distance from the other guests, and out of hearing if they spoke, in low tones.\\n\\nBut it was clear that the die was cast, and that war was declared. More, than ever, he was glad that Laura Arden was not in Rome. The thought, that if she were present she would necessarily have to follow the course, of events little by little, as he must himself, and the certainty that, she knew the truth and would feel the keenest sympathy for him, made him, rejoice at her absence. When she learned what had taken place, she would, know all the circumstances at once, including Ghisleri's proof of his, innocence, which, as he felt sure, would be triumphant. In the meantime\\n\\nSavelli began to speak, and, as he had promised, he stated the case as, he had heard it from Adele and, on the whole, very much as she had, summed it up in her own mind before going to him. Ghisleri sat with, folded arms and bent brows, listening to the wonderfully connected chain, of false testimony she brought against him, with all the courage and, calmness he could command.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Laura answered. \\\"And then, after all, I have known you ever since, I first went out as a young girl. I did not like you at first, I, remember, though I could never tell why. But as for your saying that you, cannot see why I should still be your friend, I do not understand how, you mean it. It seems to me that you have done much to get my friendship, and to strengthen it, and nothing to lose it. Besides, you yourself know, that you are not what you were. You have changed. You were saying so, only yesterday, and you said the change was for the better.\\\"\\n\\nIf Laura Arden had been present she would have been more than ever, inclined to distrust Ghisleri just then. She would have wondered what, possessed him to make him say things so very different from those he, generally said to her. As a matter of fact, he wished Adele to trust, him, for especial reasons, and he knew her well enough to judge how his, speeches would affect her. She had betrayed herself to him a few minutes, earlier and he desired to efface the impression in her mind before, leading her into another trap.\\n\\nThere was no exaggeration in the Contessa's account. The story was, actually in circulation, if the lost confession was not. Unlike the, majority of such tales, however, this one was not openly repeated or, commented upon where more than two people were present. It disappeared, and reappeared in unexpected places like the river Alpheus of old, but, its shape was not materially changed. It was told in whispers and under, terrible oaths of secrecy, and occasionally--very rarely, indeed--the, mere word \\\"Confession,\\\" spoken in casual conversation, made people smile, and look at each other. There was not even a scandalous little, paragraph in any of the daily papers, referring to it. For there are, moments when society can keep its secrets, strangely communicative as it, is at other times. The houses of Savelli and Gerano were too important, and, in a way, too powerful still, to be carelessly attacked. Indeed\\n\\nHe wrote a note to his cousin, the Prince of Sant' Ilario, another to, Gianforte Campodonico, and then a rather longer one to Savelli. In the, last mentioned, he informed the Prince that he would appear on the, morrow, with Campodonico and Sant' Ilario, and that he desired to be, received by Savelli himself in the presence of Francesco and Adele, as, he had a communication of the highest importance to make. In his usual, hard way he managed to convey the impression that it would be decidedly, the worse for the whole house of Savelli and for Adele in particular if, his request were not complied with to the letter. By the time he had, finished a servant announced that the carriage was waiting. San Giacinto, thrust a handful of black cigars and a box of matches into his outer, pocket.\\n\\nTo those who watch the changing world with its manifold scenes and its, innumerable actors, whose merest farce is ever and only the prologue to, the tragedy which awaits all, there is nothing more wonderful, nothing, more beautiful, nothing more touching--perhaps few things more, sacred--than the awakening of a noble heart at love's first magic touch., The greater miracle of spring is done before our eyes each year, the sun, shines and the grass grows, it rains and all things are refreshed, and, the dead seed's heart breaks with the joy of coming life, bursts and, shoots up to meet the warmth of the sunshine and be kissed by the west, wind. But we do not see, or seeing, care for none of these things in the, same measure in which we care for ourselves--and perhaps for others. We, turn from the budding flower wearily enough at last, and we own that, though it speak to us and touch us, its language is all but strange and, its meaning wholly a mystery. Nature tells us little except by, association with hearts that have beaten for ours, and then sometimes, she tells us all. But the heart itself is the thing, the reality, the, seat of all our thoughts and the stay of all our being. Selfishly we see, what it does in ourselves, and in others we may see it and watch it, without thought of self. It is asleep to-day, lethargic, heavy, dull\\n\\nPeople talked for some time of the Shrove Tuesday feast at Gouache's, studio. Then they fell to talking about other things. Lent passed in the, usual way, and there was not much change in the lives of the persons, most concerned in this history. Ghisleri saw much less of Arden than, formerly, of course, as the latter was wholly absorbed by his passion, for his future wife. As for the world, it was as much occupied with, dinner parties, musical evenings, and private theatricals as it had, formerly been with dancing. The time sped quickly. The past season had, left behind it an enormous Corpus Scandalorum Romanorum which made, conversation both easy and delightful. How many of the unpleasant, stories concerning Lord Herbert Arden, Laura Carlyon, Pietro Ghisleri\\n\\nThe Sister of Charity went about with Maddalena's bracelet in her, pocket, feeling very uncomfortable about it, since she had been quite, sure from the first that there was something very sinful in the whole, affair. But she was quite ready to fulfil her promise if Ghisleri showed, signs of departing this life, which he did not, however, either when he, first regained consciousness or later. So she, on her part, said, nothing, and waited for the day when she might deliver up the trinket to, the Mother Superior, to be sold for the poor, as Maddalena had directed., In that, at least, there could be no harm, and she was very thankful, that she was not called upon to deliver the message to Ghisleri himself\\n\\nAnd throughout all this quiet time the song of happiness was ever in, their ears. The world they cared so little for, and which had taken the, trouble to say such disagreeable things about them, was left infinitely, far behind in their new life. From time to time letters reached Laura, from Rome, and Arden had one from Ghisleri, containing little detailed, news, but full of angry threats at a kind of general undefined enemy\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Laura. \\\"It was all a mistake, then?\\\" \\\"Yes. But I suppose, Campodonico was irritated. In the drawing-room I lit a cigarette, and, stood some time looking at a copy of Zichy's picture of Tamara falling, into the Demon's arms. Tamara chances to be a very striking likeness of, the Princess Corleone, and if I had reflected that Campodonico might, have also noticed the fact, I would not have stood there looking at it, as I did. But I forgot. Before I knew it, he was at my elbow, evidently, very angry, for he perfectly understood why I liked the picture. He, asked me whether I did not think that a solemn promise such as we had, made might be broken under certain circumstances. I said I did not think, so. He lost his temper completely, and said I was a coward. I still, refused to quarrel with him, and he grew more and more insulting, until, at last he began a sentence which I would not let him end, to the effect, that, could Donna Bianca have been there to judge us both, she might, wish the promise broken--I suppose that would have been his, inference--if she could have seen that the man she had loved had fallen, so low as to love the lady to whom I referred a little while ago. He, named her. I answered that Donna Bianca never meant that our promise, should shield the liar who slandered a good and defenceless woman\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad to hear of your engagement, my dear old brother,\\\" he, wrote. \\\"They say Miss Carlyon is good and beautiful. I have no doubt she, is, though I do not at this moment recollect knowing any woman who was, both. I have sent the yacht to Naples for you, if you care for a cruise., Keep her as long as you like, and telegraph if you want her sent, anywhere else--Nice, for instance, or Venice. Ask your wife to wear the, pearls by way of making acquaintance at second hand. They are what I, could find. I send a man with them, as they might get lost. Now, good-bye, dear boy, enjoy yourself and come to us as soon as you can., Yours ever, HARRY.\\n\\nAll Ghisleri's suspicions revived at the news Maddalena gave him. Again, he took down the medical work he had consulted on the evening when the, idea that Adele was in some way guilty of Arden's death had first, flashed across his mind, more than a year previously. Again he read the, chapter on scarlet fever carefully from beginning to end, and sat down, to think over the possibilities in such a case, and once more, after, several days of serious consideration, he grew sceptical, and abandoned, the attempt to fathom the mystery, if mystery there were. He knew that, even without that, Adele might have written many things to her confessor, in confidence which, if repeated openly in the world, would do her, terrible harm. He was quite sure that all the infamous slanders on, Laura and her husband could ultimately be traced to Adele alone, and it, was possible that the stolen document contained a full account of them\\n\\nwith its back to the side of the room the guests crossed who went, directly to the ball-room, and facing the side by which they went from, the ball-room to the rooms beyond, and to the supper-room, for there, were four doors, opposite each other, two of which opened into the, great hall where the dancing was going on. Maddalena was seated at the, end of the sofa which was against the pillar, so that a person passing, through behind her might easily not notice her presence.\\n\\nThe connexion between him and Arden was in reality so distant, that they, had never assumed even the outward forms of intimacy, though their wives, called each other sister. Savelli disliked Lord Herbert because he was a, cripple, and chiefly because he had married Laura Carlyon. Arden, on his, side, was more or less indifferent to Francesco, but treated him always, with a shade more warmth than an ordinary acquaintance, as being, in a, sense, a member of his wife's family.\\n\\nhigh or low. The largest of the large open carriages belonging to Casa, San Giacinto was seen rolling solemnly through the city, bearing Pietro, Ghisleri, the Marchese di San Giacinto himself, and two policemen, who, looked very uncomfortable as they sat, bolt upright, side by side, with, their backs to the horses. A few hours later, the same carriage appeared, again, Pietro and the giant being still in it, but without the officers, of the law. San Giacinto insisted upon driving his friend six times, round the Villa Borghese, six times round the Pincio, and four times the, length of the Corso, before taking him back at last to his lodgings.\\n\\nand it was at least a good one. Loving her with all their hearts, in, their different ways, both Ghisleri and Campodonico respected the, obligation they had taken as something supremely sacred. Ghisleri went, and lived alone in a remote village of the south for more than a year, afterwards, and Gianforte spent an even longer period in almost total, seclusion from the world, and in the sole society of his widowed mother., Three years before the time now reached in this chronicle, he had, married, as people said, for love, and for once people were right. His, elder brother bore the title, and as there was another sister besides, the Princess Corleone, Gianforte's portion had been small, for the, family was not rich, and he and his wife lived very modestly in a small, apartment in the upper part of the city, the Palazzo Campodonico having, long ago passed into the hands of the Savelli.\\n\\nwith a vague idea that he might ultimately get the old estate together, again. He generally bought on mortgage, binding himself to pay at a, certain date, and as he was a very honourable man in all financial, transactions, he invariably paid, though sometimes at considerable, sacrifice. He said to himself that unless he were bound he would, inevitably throw away the little money he had to spare. It was a, curiously practical trait in such an unruly and almost lawless, character, but he did such things when he could, and then thought no, more about them until a fresh opportunity presented itself. He was a man, whose life and whole power of interest in life were almost constantly, absorbed by the two or three persons to whom he was sincerely attached\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course. But if there is to be that sort of conversation, it can, always take the form of a discussion, and one can put oneself on the, right side from the beginning just as easily as not. It saves so much, trouble afterwards. The person who is always on the wrong side is, generally the one about whom the others are talking. If we could hear a, tenth of what is said about ourselves I fancy we should be very, uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\nThe maid, Lucia by name, had for some time expected that her days in, Casa Savelli were numbered, for Adele had shown her dislike very plainly, of late, so that the woman did not show much surprise, and accepted her, dismissal respectfully and quietly, promising herself to tell tales in, her next place concerning Adele's toilette which, though without the, slightest foundation, would be repeated and believed all over Rome.\\n\\nHaving concluded his sermon, Gerano kissed Adele on the forehead, as he, was accustomed to do. She bent her head in silence, for she was so angry, that she could not trust herself to speak, and he left her at the door, and went home. All things considered, she knew that she had reason to be, grateful for his forbearance. She was quite sure that her father-in-law, would have behaved differently, and the stories she had heard of old, Prince Saracinesca's temper showed clearly that the race of violent, fathers was by no means yet extinct. She was not even called upon to, make a formal apology to Laura in her father's presence, which was what, she had at first expected and feared. Nothing, in fact, was required of, her except to avoid gossip and treat the Ardens with a decent show of, sisterly affection. She could scarcely have got better terms of peace\\n\\n\\\"You will everywhere say nice things about Laura and her husband. You, will say that you are now positively sure that Arden does not drink. You, will say that there is no truth whatever in the report that Laura is in, love with Francesco, and that you are absolutely certain that the Ardens, are very happy together. Those are the principal points, I believe. You, will also at once ask them to dinner, and you will repeat your, invitation often, and behave to both in a proper way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not want you to make love to me,\\\" Adele answered, \\\"though I, believe you know how to do it to perfection. It is often a very long way, from liking very much to loving a very little. This is the place where, old Gianluca kept his brother Paolo in prison for eighteen years. Then, Gianluca died suddenly one fine morning, and Paolo was let out by the, soldiers and immediately threw Gianluca's wife out of the window of the, east tower, and cut off the heads of his two sons on the same afternoon., I will show you where that was done when we go up stairs. Paolo was an, extremely energetic person.\\\"\\n\\nGhisleri started early, taking his servant with him, and reached Gerano, in time for the midday breakfast. Francesco Savelli received him with, considerable enthusiasm, and Adele's habitually rather forced smile, became more natural. Both felt in different ways that the presence of a, third person was a relief, and would have been delighted to receive a, far less agreeable man than their present guest. They overwhelmed him, with questions about Rome and their friends.\\n\\nShe paused and looked at him. He knew what she meant. If there were a, spark of love, she would forget everything and take him back on any, terms. For a moment the old struggle was violently resumed in his heart., Ought he not, for her sake, to pretend love, and to live out his life as, best he could in the letter of devotion if not in the true spirit of, love? Or would not such an attempt necessarily be a failure, and bring, her more and more unhappiness with each month and year? He only, hesitated for an instant while she paused; then he determined to say, nothing. That was really the turning-point in Pietro Ghisleri's life.\\n\\n\\\"If you happen to be a good hand at forgery,\\\" answered Ghisleri, with, perfect equanimity, \\\"write a number of letters purporting to be from him, to another woman. Put anything you like into them, take them to the, woman who loves him, and ask a large sum for them. She will probably pay, it and leave him. You will accomplish your object and earn money at the, same time. If you cannot forge his handwriting, forge that of an, imaginary woman--that is easy enough--and follow the same course as, before. It is almost sure to succeed.\\\"\\n\\nAdele dressed herself for going out and left the room. But instead of, joining her husband and Ghisleri at once, she turned out of the main, passage by the cross corridor which led to the court-yard, went out and, walked quickly down the inclined road by which she had led Ghisleri to, Paolo Braccio's dungeon. There, where the shaft of the oubliette came, down, she was quite sure of finding the little package of sheets which, meant so much to her and which had almost meant a fortune to Lucia. She, crossed the worn pavement rapidly. There was plenty of light from the, grated windows high up under the vault, and she could have seen the, paper almost as soon as she entered the place. She stopped short as she, reached the foot of the channel in the wall. There was nothing there., She stared up into the blackness above in the hope of seeing a white, thing caught and sticking to the stones, but she could not distinguish, the faintest reflection of anything. Yet she was convinced that the, thing must have fallen all the way. The shaft, as she well knew, was, quite perpendicular and the masonry compact and well finished. The, object of those who had built it had been precisely to prevent the, possibility of the victim catching on a projection of any sort while, falling.\\n\\nYet she did not look well. There was an odd, half-frightened look in her, eyes when they were all gone and she was left alone with her husband., But he did not notice it, and made it easy for her, bestowing infinite, praise upon her tact and talent as a hostess. Though she did not hear, all he said, she was vaguely pleased, that, after spending the whole, evening at Laura's side, he should stay at home instead of going to the, club, and find so many pleasant things to say. In spite of her success\\n\\nAs he repeated the last words he started for they reminded him with, painful force of Gianforte Campodonico's insulting speech, and he, detested himself for even allowing the thought to cross his mind--for, allowing himself to repeat Beatrice's words up to that point. It was he, who had dragged down Maddalena dell' Armi to his level, not she who had, made him sink to hers. And yet Campodonico had said almost the same, thing as Beatrice, and certainly without knowing it. In his heart he, knew that Bianca might have reproached him so, but then, deeper still\\n\\nwith the intention of believing oneself to be passionate by nature, and, in that sense the weakness could not justly be attributed to Ghisleri., But on this particular night he did a thing which many people would, undoubtedly have called sentimental. He turned aside from the highway, when he left the great palace in which Gouache lived, and he allowed, himself to wander aimlessly on through the older part of the city, until, he stopped opposite to the door of a church which stood in a broad, street near the end of the last by-way he had traversed. The night was, dark and gloomy and the stillness was only broken now and then by a, distant snatch of song, a burst of laughter, or the careless twang of a, guitar, just as Ghisleri had described it. Indeed it was by no means the, first time that he had walked home in the small hours of Ash Wednesday, morning, after a night of gaiety and emotion.\\n\\nthere lay another thought which he would not now evoke, lest he should, himself condemn it as sentimental. That secret promise had been honestly, intended, and had been addressed to the memory of one who, though long, dead, still had a stronger influence over him than any one now living., He hardly dared to acknowledge the truth of this and the real meaning of, what he had done, lest, if he failed hereafter, he should have to accuse, himself of faithlessness towards the one woman to whom he had been, really true, and whom, if she had lived, he would have loved till the, end, in spite of obstacles, in spite of mankind, in spite, he added, defiantly, of Heaven itself. All this he tried to keep out of sight\\n\\n\\\"It is the most absurd story I ever heard,\\\" he said. \\\"I ought not even, to say I heard it, for I guessed it from little things that happened., People think that your step-sister's husband, Savelli, is in love with, you, and I suppose they imagine that you have something to do with, it--encouraged him, and that sort of thing. I am quite sure that Donna, Adele--am I to call her Adele now?--is jealous, for I have witnessed the, manifestation with my own eyes. It is all too utterly ridiculous, but as, you are quite English you were at a disadvantage, and were not as, popular as you ought to have been.\\\"\\n\\nin order to show how high a value Ghisleri set upon the confession which, contained a concise account of her doings. But he would, in any case, be, prejudiced against her from the first. One thing was in her favour, she, thought. The Princess of Gerano did not like Ghisleri, and would in all, likelihood be ready to believe evil of him, and to influence her, husband, good and just woman though she was. There was one other person, to whom Adele could apply--Prince Savelli himself. She thought of him, last and wondered why she had not remembered him first. He was a man of, singular energy, courage, and coolness, whose chief fault was a tendency, to overestimate beyond all limits the importance of his family and the, glory of his ancient name. She knew that he was abnormally sensitive on, these points and that if she could rouse his ever ready pride, he would, hesitate at nothing in order to bring retribution upon any one rash, enough to insult or injure any member of his family. And he lived a life, of his own and cared little for the world. His passion, strangely, enough, was of a scientific kind. He was an astronomer, had built, himself an observatory on the top of the massive old palace, and spent, the greater part of his time there. Such existences, in the very heart, of society, are not unknown in Rome. Prince Savelli had remained what he, was by nature, a true student, and was perfectly happy in his own way\\n\\nevery hand is hidden to make the sign of defence; no one will speak to, him who can help it, and then always with concealed fingers kept rigidly, bent in the orthodox fashion, or clasped upon a charm of proved, efficacy. Few, indeed, are those brave enough to ask such a man to, dinner, and they are esteemed almost miraculously fortunate if no, misfortune befalls them during the succeeding four and twenty hours, if, their houses do not burn, and their children do not develop the measles., Incredible as it may appear to northern people, a man or woman may be, socially ruined by the imputation of \\\"projecting,\\\" when it is sustained, by the coinciding of the very smallest accident with their presence, or, with the mention of their names, and quite enough of such coincidences, were actually noted in Laura's case to make the reputation of being a, jettatrice cling to her for life. Ghisleri knew this, and his wrath was, kindled, and smouldered, and grew hot, till it was ready to burst out at, a moment's notice and do considerable damage.\\n\\nfor the sake of the persons concerned. It was very far from Maria B.'s, thoughts to degrade herself by setting a price upon the documents. If, Lady Herbert cared to possess them they should be hers, and any small, reward she might be willing to give would be humbly and thankfully, accepted. In order that she might judge of the nature of the letters in, question, Maria B. enclosed a copy of the one last written before the, transaction alluded to had been concluded. Lady Herbert would be able to, understand the names from the initials used by the copyist.\\n\\n\\\"The man should be tried, convicted, and sent to the galleys,\\\" said, Gerano. \\\"There can be no doubt of the justice of that, if all this can, be established in court. Remember I do not doubt my daughter's word, and, it would be monstrous to suppose that she has invented this story., Whatever the truth about it may be, it must be thoroughly investigated., But there may be a good deal of exaggeration about it, for I have known, Adele to over-state a case. There is a great difference between shutting, one's door on a man, or turning him out of his club, and bringing an, accusation against him which, if proved, will entail a term of penal, servitude. You see that, I am sure. Do you not think that we ought to go, and see Ghisleri together, tell him what we have learned, and ask him to, justify himself if he can?\\\"\\n\\nWhen he left the house, Arden drove to a certain studio, and then and, there bought a small picture which Laura had admired very much, and had, been two or three times to see. To the artist's surprise, he insisted, upon carrying it away with him at once, just as it was. Then he told the, coachman to drive to the Palazzo Savelli. He sent up his card and asked, to see Don Francesco, and at once received an answer, begging him to go, up stairs.\\n\\n\\\"You always take shelter behind assertions of that kind. I know it is of, no use to ask you to tell me the whole story, for if you were willing to, tell it, you would have told it to me already. No one can conceal fact, as you can and yet never be caught in a downright falsehood. Half an, hour ago, when we were sitting in that other room, you knew just as well, as you do now that you were to fight to-morrow, and you had not the, slightest intention of telling me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope you are right. If you are not my friend, who should be? So you, think I hate you. You are very wrong. I am still very fond of you. I, told you so the other day. You should believe me. Remember, when it all, ended, it was you who had changed--not I. I am not reproaching you. I, might say that you should have known yourself better than to think that, you could be faithful; but you might tell me--and it would be quite as, just--that I, a woman, knew what I was doing and had been taught to look, upon my deeds as you never could. But it was you who changed. If you had, loved me, I should have loved you still. Little things showed me long, ago that your love was waning. It was never what it was in those first, days. And now I have changed, too. I love what was once, but if I could, have your love now as it was at its strongest and best, I would not ask, for it. Why should I? I could never trust it again, and anything is, better than that doubt. And I want no consolation.\\\"\\n\\nand he had long been in the habit of throwing into a rough, impersonal, shape, the thoughts that crossed his mind about himself and others, when, he was alone at night. Being, as he very truly said, no poet, he quickly, tore up such odds and ends of halting rhyme or stumbling prose, either, as soon as they were written, or the next morning. Whatever the form of, these productions might be, the ideas they expressed were rarely feeble, and were indeed sometimes so strong that they might have even shocked, some unusually sensitive person in the gay set.\\n\\nand that might, some day, develop into real madness. She was sane enough, still, however, to suffer, and no such merciful termination to her, sufferings as the loss of her reason would be seemed at all imminent., The strong will and acute intelligence had survived, for the poisonous, drug she loved had attacked the body, which was the weaker portion of, her being. Adele was hopelessly paralysed. The last great effort had, been too much for the over-strung nerves. Her hands still moved, convulsively, but she could not direct them at all. Her jaw had dropped\\n\\nWe find no fault with Mr. Henry James's \\\"Princess Casamassima.\\\" It is a, great novel; it is his greatest, and it is incomparably the greatest, novel of the year in our language....

It made his blood sting to, think that a man who had been loved to the latest breath by such a woman, as Bianca should throw himself at the feet of Maddalena dell' Armi--not, to mention any of the others for whom Pietro had felt an ephemeral, passion during the last six years and more. And Pietro, on his side\\n\\nIn the natural course of events, social and domestic, it became, necessary to choose a husband for Adele so soon as she made her first, appearance in society. At that time Laura was not yet seventeen. Gerano, had already looked about him and had made up his mind. He was a little, dark-eyed man, grey, thin and nervous, but gifted with an unusually, agreeable manner, a pleasant tone of voice, a frank glance, and an, extremely upright character--a man much liked in the world and a good, deal respected.\\n\\n\\\"I know more of what you have done for me than you suppose,\\\" said Laura., \\\"Never mind that. The facts are simple enough. We are good friends; we, depend, for a certain amount of happiness, upon seeing one another, often; because the world does not understand, it expects us to sacrifice, our inclinations. For my part, I refuse. There is only one person to be, consulted--my mother, who is dearer to me than any friend can be. I will, speak to her and make her see the truth. In the mean time do nothing\\n\\nand to reflect upon his future conduct, before sending for Ubaldini and, consulting with him. He had almost expected the demand to restore a, document he did not possess, but he was not prepared for the, well-constructed story by which Savelli, Gerano, and their lawyer had, been persuaded of his guilt. The lawyer's words had placed the whole, affair in a light which showed how thoroughly convinced the three men, were of the justice of their accusation, and Ghisleri understood well, enough that Savelli intended to take legal steps. What those steps might, be, Pietro had not the least idea. He rang for Bonifazio and sent him, out to buy the Penal Code. It was probably the wisest thing he could do, under the circumstances, as he did not even know whether, if he were, arrested, he should be admitted to bail or not. He saw well enough that, an order for his arrest might very possibly be issued. Grondona was far, too grave and learned a lawyer to have uttered such a threat in vain\\n\\nOf course, her manner was greatly changed from what it had been. She, never laughed now, and rarely ever smiled, except when she held the, child in her arms. But there was nothing morbid nor brooding in her, gravity. She had accepted her lot and was determined to make the best of, it according to her light. In time she would grow more cheerful, and by, and by she would be her old self again--more womanly, perhaps, and, certainly more mature, but not materially altered in character or, disposition. The short months which had sufficed for what had hitherto, been the chief acts of her life had not been filled with violent or, conflicting emotions, and it is emotion more than anything else which, changes the natures of men and women for better or for worse. The love, that had been born of mingled pity and sympathy of thought had risen, quickly in the peaceful, remote places of her heart, and had flowed, smoothly through the sweet garden of her maidenly soul, unruffled and, undeviating, until it had suddenly disappeared into the abyss of, eternity. It had left no wreck and no ruin behind, no devastation and no, poisonous, stagnant pools, as some loves do. The soil over which it had, passed had been refreshed and made fertile by it, and would bear flowers, and fruit hereafter as fragrant and as sweet as it could ever have, borne; and at the last, in that one great moment of pain when she had, stood at the brink and seen all she loved plunge out of sight for ever, in the darkness, she had heard in her ear the tender cry of a new young, life calling to her to turn back and tend it, and love it, and show it, the paths that lead to such happiness as the world holds for the pure in, heart.\\n\\nLaura had never found much that was congenial in the city in which she, had been brought up as though it had been her birthplace. As for Arden, himself, he was too much accustomed to travelling from place to place to, prefer one city to another in any great degree. So the two were alone, together and desired nothing beyond what they had, which, perhaps, is, the ideal condition for lovers. To most people, however, the honeymoon, is a terrible trial--probably because most young couples are not very, desperately in love with each other. They wander aimlessly about in all, directions, a sort of joint sacrifice, perpetually tortured and daily, offered up on the altar of the diabolical courier, crushed beneath the, ubiquitous Juggernaut hotel-keeper, bound continually in new and arid, places to be torn by the vulture guide, and ultimately sent home more or, less penniless, quite temperless, and perhaps permanently disgusted with, one another and with married life. And yet the absurd farce is kept up\\n\\nMaddalena did not hesitate. She dressed herself in an old black frock, she found among her things, put on a thick veil, went out alone, and, drove to Pietro's lodgings. Such rash things may be done with impunity, in Paris or London, but they rarely remain long concealed in a small, city like Rome. He was still unconscious from weakness and loss of, blood. His eyes were half closed and his face was transparently white., Maddalena stood still at the foot of the bed and looked at him, while, the doctor and the nurse gazed at her in surprise. During what seemed an, endless time to them she did not move. Then she beckoned to the surgeon\\n\\nThey parted on very bad terms that day, and two or three days more, passed before they saw each other again. The Contessa had almost made up, her mind that she would not speak to San Giacinto at all, and Ghisleri, began to think that she wished to break with him permanently. Far more, sensitive than any one supposed, he had been deeply wounded by her words, and tone, so deeply indeed that he scarcely wished to meet her for the, present. The world did not fail to see the coldness that had come, between them, and laughed heartily over it. The Contessa, said the, world, thought that the way to keep Ghisleri was to be cold to him and, encourage Pietrasanta, but she did not know dear Ghisleri, who did not, care in the very least, who had not a particle of sensitiveness in him\\n\\nThen she told her story from beginning to end. She of course took, advantage of the fact that her father-in-law was but slightly acquainted, with Ghisleri to paint his character with the colours best suited to her, purpose, while asserting nothing about him which could be in direct, contradiction to the testimony of others. She spoke very lucidly and, connectedly, for she knew the lesson well and she was conscious that her, whole existence was at stake. One fault, one little error sufficient to, cast suspicion on her veracity, might be enough to ruin her in the end., She concluded by a well-turned and pathetic allusion to her state of, health, which indeed was pitiable enough. She knew that she was dying\\n\\ndo not think that is a phrase. I do not love you any more. Are you glad, to know it? I wish I did. But I am far too fond of you not to wish you, to be happy if you can. You are my dearest and best friend. It is, strange, is it not? Think of me kindly sometimes, in your new life., And--and do not speak my name before her, if you can help it. She knows, what we were to each other once, and it might hurt her.\\\"\\n\\nLaura had not yet returned, and he was glad, on the whole, that she was, away. Matters were evidently coming to a crisis, and he believed that, whatever was to happen would have long been over by the time she was in, Rome again. If she had already arrived he would have found it hard not, to tell her of what occurred from day to day, and, indeed, he would have, felt almost obliged to do so for the sake of her opinion of him, seeing, how frankly and loyally she had acted in the case of the letters she had, received from the supposititious \\\"Maria B.\\\" On the other hand, he longed, to see her for her own sake. The summer months had been desperately long, and lonely. He did not remember that he had ever found the time weigh so, heavily on his hands as this year, both at Torre de' Ghisleri and in, Rome. He forgot his present danger and the interview before him in, thinking of Laura Arden, when Bonifazio threw open the door and, announced Prince Savelli, the Prince of Gerano, and the Advocato, Geronimo Grondona.\\n\\nOn the following day the news was announced to the city and the world., The world held up its hands in wonder, and its tongue wagged for a whole, week and a few days more. Laura Carlyon was to marry a penniless cripple, of the most dissipated habits. How shocking! Of course every one knew, that Lord Herbert had not fainted at all on that night at the Palazzo, Braccio, but had succumbed, in the natural course of events, to the, effects of the champagne he had taken at dinner. That was now quite, certain. And the whole world was well aware that his father had cut him, off with a pittance on account of his evil ways, and that his brother, had twice paid his gambling debts to save the family name from disgrace., Englishmen as a race, and English cripples in particular, were given to, drink and high play. The man had actually been the worse for wine when, talking to Laura Carlyon in her mother's house, and Ghisleri had been, obliged to carry him out for decency's sake before anything worse, happened. Scandalous! It was a wonder that Ghisleri, who, after all, was, a gentleman, could associate with such a fellow. After all, nobody ever, liked Laura Carlyon since she had first appeared in society, soon after, dear Donna Adele's marriage. It was as well that she should go to, England and live with her tipsy cripple. She was good-looking, as some, people admitted. She might win the heart of her brother-in-law and, induce him to pay her husband's debts a third time. They were said to be, enormous.\\n\\nwhich strongly suggested the high predominance of all that was good over, the ordinary instincts of average human nature. He felt a sort of, reverence for her which he had never felt for any one; he knew that she, was good, he imagined that she was almost saintly in her life, and he, believed that she might, under certain circumstances become, in the best, religious sense, a holy woman. Had he seen her on that evening when, Arden had found her strangling an imaginary enemy in a fit of, exceedingly human anger, he could hardly have accepted the evidence of, his senses. All that was good in her appealed directly through all that, was bad in him to the small remnant of the better nature which had, survived through his misspent life. It did not, indeed, rouse in him the, slightest active desire to imitate her virtues. The very idea that he, could ever be virtuous in any sense, brought a smile to his face. But he, could not help admiring what he knew to be so very far beyond his, sphere--what he believed, perhaps, to be even further from his reach, than it actually was. He had reached that almost morbid stage of, self-contempt in which a man, while still admiring goodness in others\\n\\nBefore night he received a note from Laura Arden. She wrote that she had, seen him driving, though he had not seen her pass, as he had been, looking in the opposite direction. If he was able to bear the fatigue of, making a call, she begged that he would come to her at any hour he chose, to name, as she wished to speak to him. He answered at once that he, would be at her house on the following day at three o'clock.\\n\\nHe had hardly finished speaking when the door opened, and Donald, announced Don Francesco and Donna Adele Savelli. A very slight shadow, passed over Laura's face, as she rose to meet her step-sister, but, Ghisleri remained cold and impassive. Adele started perceptibly, as, Laura had done, when she saw him, and Ghisleri was struck by the change, in her own appearance. Her expression was that of a woman who is in, almost constant pain, and who has grown restless under it, and fears its, return at any moment. Her eyes turned uneasily, glancing about the room, in all directions, and avoiding the faces of those present. She was, pale, too, and looked altogether ill.\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" exclaimed the Marchesa, who had known the Princess of Sant', Ilario more than twenty years earlier. \\\"No one was ever so beautiful as, Corona. Laura is much shorter, too, and that makes a difference. Laura, reminds one of a saint, and Corona looked an empress--or what empresses, are supposed to be like. But Laura is a beautiful woman. There is no one, to compare with her now but Christina Campodonico, and she is too thin., What a good looking couple Ghisleri and his wife will make. He has grown, younger during the last two years.\\\"\\n\\nHe joined in the conversation during a few minutes longer, and then took, leave of the three. Formerly he would have gone to spend an hour or two, with Maddalena, but he had no inclination to do so now. He would gladly, have stayed with Laura if the Savelli couple had not come. He wished to, be alone, now, and to think over what he had done. It was the first time, that he had ever told the story of his love for Bianca Corleone to any, one, and calm as he had seemed while telling it, he had felt a very, strong emotion. He was glad to be at home again, alone with his own, thoughts, and with the picture that reminded him of the dead woman. He, knew that she would have forgiven him for speaking of her to-day as he, had spoken, and to such a woman as Laura Arden. For in his heart he, compared the two. There had been grand lines in Bianca Corleone's, character, as there were in that of her passionate brother, as Ghisleri, believed there must be in Laura Arden's also, and great generosities\\n\\nNevertheless, he was conscious of being surprised at the calmness of his, own repentance, as he called it rather contemptuously, and he wished, himself, as usual, quite different from what he was. And yet he had not, forgotten the semi-theatrical resolution to change his life, which he, had made on the night before the duel, still less had he any intention, of breaking it. He had always laughed at men and women who made sudden, and important resolutions under the influence of emotion, and, on the, whole, he had never seen any reason for looking upon such gratuitous, promises as valid, unless there had been witnesses to them, and human, vanity afterwards came into play. But now, in his own case, he meant to, try the experiment. It made no difference whether he were vain about it, or not, if he succeeded, nor, if he failed, whether he scorned his own, weakness a little more than before. No one would ever know, and since by, Laura Arden's rigid standard of right and wrong the end to be gained, belonged distinctly to the right, he would be in a measure following her, advice in regard to life in general. Deeper down in his nature, too\\n\\nand he has told me that unless some saint performs a miracle nothing can, save you at the trial. So that I must give my evidence. But if I do, the, Princess Adele will go to the galleys, and the house of Savelli will be, quite ruined. For the Princess murdered Lord Herbert Arden, and tried to, murder Donna Laura, as we call her. She invited them to dinner and gave, them napkins which she with her own hand had poisoned with infection of, the scarlet fever, her maid Lucia having had it at the time. And Lord, Herbert died within three days, but Donna Laura did not catch it. And I, have read how she did this, and many other wicked things, in a letter, written with her own hand. For it was I who found the confession they, speak of, when I went alone to look at the old prisons at Gerano, while, you and the signori were out driving. And now I do not know what to do\\n\\nAs she proceeded she watched the Prince's face, and she saw that she had, produced the right impression from the first. The plausibility of the, tale, as she told it, was undeniable, and might have shaken the belief, in Ghisleri's integrity in the minds of men who knew him far better than, the elder Savelli. As she had anticipated, the latter took up the, question as one deeply affecting the honour of his name. He was very, angry in his calm way, and his blue eyes flashed through his great, gold-rimmed spectacles, while his slender, energetic white hand clenched, itself and opened frequently upon his knee.\\n\\n\\\"Just as you went to get me the lemonade, I heard two people talking in, a low voice behind me,\\\" said Maddalena. \\\"They must have stopped first by, the door--I looked round afterwards and saw them, but I do not know, either of them--some new people from one of the other embassies, or, merely foreigners here on a visit. They spoke rather bad French. There, was a man and a lady. They saw you cross the room and the lady asked the, man who you were, and the man told her, saying that he only knew you by, sight. The lady uttered an exclamation, and said that you were the one, man in Rome whom she wished to see because you had been loved by--you, know whom I mean--I know it hurts you to speak of her, and I understand, it. The man laughed and said there had been others since, and that there, was especially a certain Marquise d' Armi, as he called me, who was, madly in love with you. The most amusing part of the whole thing\\n\\n\\\"I would rather you should not do that,\\\" she said at last. \\\"I may as, well tell you what I think about it. To me, and to you, it seems, thoroughly absurd that you should not see me whenever we choose to meet., There are many reasons why I should look upon you as a friend, and why, you should come more often than any other man I know. But the world, thinks differently. My mother has spoken to me about it more than once\\n\\nGhisleri grew even more careful of his speech after that. But he did not, see Laura often before she went away northward for the summer. The, spring was going fast, and the time was coming when Rome would be its, quiet old-fashioned self again for those few who loved it well enough to, face the heat of July and August. Almost every one was thinking of going, away. The Prince and Princess of Gerano were going out to the castle, earlier than usual, for the news of Adele grew steadily worse. Francesco, now had the doctor out regularly three times a week, and was forced to, lead an existence he detested. His wife was by this time quite unable to, get rest without taking very large quantities of chloral, and at times, her sufferings were such that it seemed almost advisable to give her, morphia. Every one, however, who brought intelligence from Gerano agreed, in saying that she did her best to keep up, and seemed to dread the idea, of an illness which might keep her permanently in her room. Whenever, she felt able she insisted on driving out and on going through the, regular round of monotonous country occupations. Her father and, step-mother therefore determined to go out and help Francesco to take, care of her, and make her existence as bearable as possible. Amongst all, her friends she was spoken of with the utmost compassion, and no one, ever suggested that her illness could proceed from any such cause as, Ghisleri believed to be at the root of it.\\n\\nThe servant returned as he finished, and handed his master the little, yellow-covered volume with an expression of inquiry on his face., Ghisleri looked at him and hesitated, debating whether it would be wise, to warn the man of what might take place at any moment. There was much, friendliness in the relations between the two. Bonifazio had been with, Pietro many years and perhaps understood the latter's character better, than any one. The servant was almost as unlike other people, in his own, way, as Ghisleri himself, and was in two respects a remarkable contrast, to him. He was imperturbably good-tempered in the first place, and, in, the second, he was extremely devout. But there were resemblances also\\n\\nWhile making the most desperate attempts to control herself, Adele was, in a state of the wildest and most conflicting emotion. Her strength, returned, indeed, in a certain measure after a few hours, but her, distress seemed rather to increase than to diminish, when she was able, to walk about the room and submit to being dressed. Her maid irritated, her unaccountably, too, and at last, giving way to the impulse she had, felt so long, she told her that she must go at the end of the month.\\n\\nThey had scarcely sat down and he could see that Ghisleri was beginning, to talk, when Anastase Gouache appeared and stood still before them. To, Arden's surprise the Contessa welcomed him with a bright smile and, pointed to a chair at her side of the sofa. Anastase Gouache was a, celebrated painter who had married a Roman lady of high birth, and was a, very agreeable man, but Arden had not expected that he would be invited, so readily to interrupt so promising a conversation. Ghisleri's face, expressed nothing. He appeared to join in the talk for a few minutes and, then rose and left the Contessa with Gouache. She looked after him, and, Arden thought she grew a shade paler and frowned. A faint smile appeared, on the Englishman's face and was gone again in an instant as Ghisleri, came near him, returning again to the ball-room. Ghisleri had glanced at, him as he passed and had seen that he was not talking to a lady.\\n\\nand reticent in the highest degree. That such an otherwise perfect, creature should have defects was only to be expected. Bonifazio was as, obstinate as flint when he had made up his mind as to how any particular, thing was to be done. He was silently officious, in his anxiety to be, always ready to fulfil his master's wishes, and often annoyed him in, small ways by thrusting services upon him which he did not require. On, rare occasions he would insist upon giving very useless and uncalled-for, advice.\\n\\nSo the dinner passed off admirably--so well, indeed, that when all were, going home, Laura and her mother looked at one another as though they, could hardly believe what they had seen and heard. The Princess of, Gerano began to doubt the truth of the accusations against Adele, and, even Laura fancied that they must have been very much exaggerated. The, Prince, himself, the only one of the party who had heard the slander, from Adele's own lips, sentence by sentence, and almost word for word as, Ghisleri had repeated it to him, wisely held his peace, while by no, means so wisely believing that his daughter had repented and was, carrying out his instructions in all sincerity. He kissed her, affectionately on the forehead when he went away, and she felt that she, had won a victory.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he ascertained that Laura was likely to be hampered for ready, money. Her mother's private resources were very slender, and Laura was, far too proud to accept any assistance from Adele Savelli's father. She, could not dispose, as a matter of fact, of anything which her husband, had left her except the actual ready money which happened to be in the, house; for she could not even draw upon his letters of credit until the, will was proved and the legal formalities all carried out. It was, natural, too, that at such a time she should neither be aware of her, position nor give a thought to such a trivial matter as household, expenses.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, she behaved with a courage and determination, admirable in themselves. Few women could have borne the constant strain, upon the faculties at all, still fewer after such illness as she had, suffered. But she was really very strong, though everything which, affected her feelings and thoughts reacted upon her physical nature as, such things never can in less nervously organised constitutions. She, bore the excruciating anxiety about the lost confession better than the, shadowy fear of the supernatural which still haunted her in the hours of, the night. On the third day she begged her husband to increase the dose, of chloral by a very small quantity, saying that if only she could sleep, well for a whole week she would then be so much better as to be able to, give it up altogether. Savelli hesitated, and at last consented. Since, she had seemed so much more quiet he dreaded a return of her former, state, for he was a man who loved his ease and hated everything which, disturbed it.\\n\\nThey continued to talk upon indifferent subjects. At dinner Pietro took, much pains to be agreeable, and succeeded admirably, for he was well, able to converse pleasantly when he chose. Though extremely tired, he, sat up till nearly midnight talking politics with Savelli, as Adele had, foreseen, and when he was at last shown to his distant room by, Bonifazio, who had spent most of his day in studying the topography of, the castle, he was very nearly exhausted.\\n\\nand somewhat novel, so that every one was delighted. As a matter of, fact, the Count did not care a straw for his wife, rarely saw her at, all, and then only to discuss the weather. He had married her in order, that her fortune might help him in his political career, he had got what, he wanted, and he was supremely indifferent to the rest. The sad part of, the matter was--if any one had known the truth--that poor Maddalena, dell' Armi had been married out of a convent, and had then and there, fallen madly in love with him, her own husband. He had resented her, excessive affection, as it interfered with his occupations and, amusements, and after an interval of five years, during which the, unhappy young wife shed endless tears and suffered intensely, he had the, satisfaction of seeing that she no longer loved him in the least, and, rather avoided him than otherwise. In taking a fancy to Pietro Ghisleri, he thought she had shown considerable discrimination, since every one, knew that Ghisleri was a very discreet man. The amazing cynicism of his, view altogether escaped him. He was occupied in politics. If he had, observed it, he would have undoubtedly laughed as heartily as he did, when a lady on the outskirts of society told him that he was supposed to, be a jealous husband.\\n\\nThat night, in despair, she swallowed a larger dose of sulphonal than, she had ever taken before. The consequence was that towards two o'clock, she fell asleep and seemed more quiet than usual, as the nurse watched, her. An hour passed without her waking, then another, and then the dawn, stole through the panes of the deep windows, and daylight came at last., The room was quite light, and Adele was generally awake at that hour., But this morning she slept on. The nurse was accustomed to take away, the lamps as soon as Adele needed them no longer, not extinguishing them, in the room on account of the disagreeable smell they made. It chanced, on this occasion--or fate had decreed it--that one of these gave signs, of going out. The nurse rose very softly and took it away, moving, noiselessly in her felt slippers, passing through the open door of the, dressing-room in order to reach the corridor in which the lamps were, left to be taken and cleaned at a later hour. She set the one she, carried upon a deal table which stood there, and tried to put it out, so, as to leave no part of the wick still smouldering, lest it should smoke., She was a very careful and methodical woman, and took pains to be neat, in doing the smallest things. Just now, too, she was in no hurry, for it, was broad daylight, and Adele would not be nervous if she awoke and, found herself alone.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid not. Even my lawyer thinks that your testimony would not, help me much. After all, you know what happened. I told you that I was, innocent, and you believed me. Or, if you please, you believed me, innocent before I said I was. There is only your belief or my word to, fall back upon, and neither would prove anything in court. Ubaldini says, so. I really expect to be convicted, and I will bear it as well as I, can. I will certainly not do anything to escape from it all.\\\" He had, hesitated as he reached the last words, but he saw that Laura, understood.\\n\\nand that she herself expected no return of it. That alone was enough to, change his whole existence in the present, and in the immediate future., Then, too, he felt that he had at least settled old scores with, Campodonico and had in a measure expiated one, at least, of his past, misdeeds, almost at the cost of his life. Morally speaking, too, he had, kept his oath to Bianca Corleone, for under the utmost provocation he, had refused to fight in the old quarrel, and even when driven to bay and, forced upon new ground by Campodonico's implacable hatred, he had stood, up to be killed without so much as firing at Bianca's brother. There, was a deep and real satisfaction in that, and he was perhaps too ill as, yet to torture himself by stigmatising it as a bit of vanity. The world, might think what it pleased. Maddalena might misjudge his motives, and, Gianforte might triumph in his victory--it all made no difference to, him. He was conscious that to the best of his ability he had acted, according to the dictates of true honour, as he understood it; and at, night he closed his eyes and fell peacefully asleep, and in the morning, he opened them quietly again upon the little world of his invalid's, surroundings.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, unless a man is very rich. Bring a suit against his title, and, if he fights it, the lawyers will eat up all he has. Then you can play, the magnanimous part and say that you give up the suit out of pity for, him. That is very pretty, too. But the prettiest of all is the new way, of killing people, because nobody can possibly find you out.\\\"\\n\\nBut now a change had come. For the first time in years, he knew that if, the choice were suddenly offered him at the present moment he would, choose to live out all the days allotted to him, and would wish that, they might be many rather than few. There was, indeed, a dark spot on, the page last turned, of which he could never efface the memory, nor, in, his own estimation, outlive the shame. In his day-dreams Maddalena dell', Armi's coldly perfect face was often before him with an expression upon, it which he feared to see, knowing too well why it was there--and out of, a deeper depth of memory dead Bianca Corleone's eyes looked at him with, reproach and sometimes with scorn. There was much pain in store for him, yet, of the kind at which the world never guessed, nor ever could. But, he would not try to escape from it. He would not again so act or think, as to call himself coward in his own heart's tribunal.\\n\\n\\\"MY DEAR SIGNOR GHISLERI:--I care for the world and its opinion much,     less than you do for my sake, or than you suppose I do for myself. I,     mean to see you, and to have it known that I see you, and I will. If,     you are not here to-morrow at precisely one o'clock I will go to,     your lodgings and wait for you if you are out. People may say what,     they please.\\n\\nshe should be kept in ignorance of what was occurring. Having decided, this point, he began to think of choosing some person to whom, if he, were actually arrested, he might apply for assistance in the matter of, obtaining bail. There was no time to be lost, as he was well aware., Since Savelli really believed him guilty of the abominable crime with, which he was charged, it was not likely that time would be given him to, leave the country, as his adversaries would naturally expect that he, would attempt to do. They had probably gone straight from his lodging to, the office of the chief of police,--the questore, as he is called in, Italy,--and if they succeeded, as in all likelihood they would, in, getting a warrant for his arrest, he might expect the warrant to be, executed at any moment during the day. It was extremely important that, he should be prepared for the worst. He thought of all the men he knew\\n\\nFaithful and devoted in every way, he wholly disapproved, on religious, grounds, of Ghisleri's mode of life, even so far as he was acquainted, with it. He considered that Pietro lived and had lived for many years in, seven-fold deadly sin, and he daily offered up the most sincere prayers, for Pietro's repentance and reformation. Twice a year, also, he, privately presented the parish priest with a small charity out of his, savings, requesting him to say a mass for Ghisleri's benefit. Obstinate, in this as in everything else, he firmly believed that his master's soul, might ultimately be saved by sheer prayer-power, so to say.\\n\\nLaura read aloud a great deal in the intervals of conversation, and the, days passed almost too quickly. The vessel was a large steam-yacht, of, the modern type, comfortable in the extreme, and capable of, accommodating a large party--for two persons it was almost palatial., Whatever the weather, cool or hot, rainy or dry, rough or fair, there, was always a place where they could install themselves in the morning or, the afternoon, and talk and read to their hearts' content. They had no, fixed plan either in their wanderings, but went where their fancy took, them, to Palermo, to Messina, to Syracuse. They sat together in the vast, ruined theatre above magic Taormina, and gazed on the sunlit sea and, Etna's snowy crest. They went to Malta, they drove, side by side\\n\\nBut she did not answer, as she sank into a chair before the table, and, almost mechanically dipped a pen into the ink. San Giacinto laid the, formal denial before her, holding the confession behind him, for he, believed her capable of snatching it from him and tossing it into the, fire at any moment. She signed painfully in large, sloping characters, that decreased rapidly in size at the end of each of her two names. The, pen fell from her hand as she finished, and San Giacinto quietly laid, the sealed letter before her. If she had been on the point of fainting\\n\\nNow Padre Bonaventura of the Minor Order of St. Francis was Adele's, confessor in Rome. After the long struggle which Lucia had watched, through the door, Adele's conscience had got the upper hand, aided by, the belief that in following its dictates she would be doing the best, she could towards recovering her peace of mind. Not being willing to go, to the parish priest of Gerano, who had known her and all her family, from her childhood, and who was by no means a man able to give very wise, advice in difficult cases, and being, moreover, afraid of rousing her, husband's suspicions if she insisted upon going to Rome merely to, confess, she had written out a most careful confession of those sins of, which she accused herself, and, as is allowable in extreme cases, had, sent it by post to Padre Bonaventura.\\n\\nbeautiful, good Laura Arden for his wife, especially since she was so, immensely rich? Doubt the justice of Heaven after that, if you could! As, for the world, it meant to tell them both how sorry it was that it had, misunderstood them. Of course it would be sinful not to hope that Adele, might some day get well, but she had her deserts, and if she ever came, back to society, people would not care to meet her. She might go mad, again at any moment and try to ruin some one else, and might succeed the, next time, too.\\n\\nAdele turned pale and leaned against the wall, breathing hard. If Lucia, had acted differently she might have been suspected of having told a, falsehood, and of keeping the letter back in order to extort a larger, sum for it at some future time. But Lucia had evidently been frightened., Moreover, the woman was undoubtedly ignorant of the existence of the, well under the stone, or, she would never have been so foolish as to, choose such a place for hiding anything so valuable, and it was clear, that she had no idea of the manner in which the package had disappeared., That it must have reached the bottom, Adele was quite sure. In that case, some one had been in the dungeon before her and had picked it up, but, who the some one might be she had no means of conjecturing.\\n\\nconsidering what she knew. She suspected some new and tortuous, development of his character, and would have instinctively drawn back, from the intimacy she felt was growing up between him and herself, had, she not by experience found out that she might be quite wrong about him, after all. She tried, at the present juncture, to shake off the, sensation which was now far more distasteful to her than it had formerly, been, in proportion as she had fancied that she understood him better., But she could not altogether succeed. It was too strange, in her, opinion, that he should willingly be Adele's guest, and put himself, under even a slight obligation to her. It showed, she thought, how, individual views could differ in regard to friendship. She was even, rather surprised to find that she was asking herself whether, if, Gianforte and Christina Campodonico possessed a habitable castle and, invited her to stop with them, she would accept, considering that, Gianforte had almost killed her husband's best friend. She, unhesitatingly decided that she would not, and resented Ghisleri's, willingness to receive hospitality from one who, as he well knew, had, foully slandered both Arden and herself. Her doubts were certainly, justifiable to a certain extent. But there was no immediate probability, that they would be cleared away for the present. Ghisleri understood her, perfectly, and wondered whether he were not risking too much in, endangering a friendship so precious to him for the sake of following, out a suspicion which might, in the end, prove to have been altogether, without foundation. On the other hand, his natural obstinacy of purpose, when once called into play was such as not to leave the smallest, hesitation in his mind between doing what he had determined to do, or, not doing it, when he had once made up his mind, irrespective of, consequences. Having lost sight of the virtue of constancy, he clung to, a vicious obstinacy as a substitute.\\n\\nThe huge, giant strength of the man was imposing in itself, apart from, the terribly determined look of the iron features and deep-set eyes. Few, men would have cared to find themselves opposed to San Giacinto even, when he was perfectly calm, hardly any, perhaps, if his anger was, roused. The last time he had been angry had been when he dragged the, forger, Arnoldo Meschini, from the library to the study in Palazzo, Montevarchi more than twenty years earlier. His hair was turning grey, now, but there were no outward signs of any diminution in his powers\\n\\n, Pietro at once realised the situation and the meaning of the look he, saw. Something was passing in his old enemy's mind which had passed, through his own while he was looking at the picture, for Campodonico and, Ghisleri were both thinking of the extraordinary resemblance between, poor Bianca Corleone and the Tamara of Zichy's painting. That, resemblance, striking in a high degree, was the reason why Ghisleri, liked it, and had a photograph of it at his lodging. He regretted now, that he should have been so tactless as to stand long before it when, Campodonico was in the room. It was too late, however, and there was, nothing to be done but to meet the man's angry look quietly, and go, away. It was unfortunate that there should have been any discussion, between them at dinner, too, for Campodonico, as his wife said, was, hot-tempered in the extreme, and Ghisleri, though outwardly calm, had, always been liable to outbreaks of dangerous anger. There was, indeed\\n\\nThe tone this time, was, if possible, more humble and piteous than, before. After enumerating and discanting upon the horrible sufferings, the family underwent, and declaring that unless some charitable, Christian would give assistance in some shape, even were it but a loaf, of bread, the whole household must inevitably perish, and after adding, that father, mother, and all four children--the latter of tender, age--expected to be turned into the street by a hard-hearted landlord\\n\\nShe might have been proud to shed them, for they showed how much more, she loved her husband than she cared for herself, but she was conscious, only of the intense desire to face Adele, and do her some grievous, bodily hurt and be revenged for the foul slander cast on Herbert Arden., She opened and shut her hands convulsively, as though she were clutching, some one and strangling the breath in a living throat. Every drop of, blood in her young body was fire, every tear that rolled down her pale, cheek was molten lead, every beat of her angry pulse brought an angry, thought to her brain. How long she remained in this state she did not, know.\\n\\nand after a little hesitation he decided that he would write to San, Giacinto. The latter had always been friendly to him, and Pietro, remembered how he had spoken at the club, years ago, when Pietrasanta, was gossiping about Arden's supposed intemperance. San Giacinto's very, great moral weight in the world, due in different degrees to his, character, his superior judgment, and his enormous wealth, made him the, most desirable of allies. While he was waiting for Bonifazio's return\\n\\n, As Ghisleri had anticipated, Adele kept up a lively correspondence with, him for some time. All her letters were duly filed by Ubaldini, who took, certified copies of Pietro's replies, but did not mention what he, himself had done in the matter. Adele bargained sharply until Ghisleri, wrote to her as plainly as he well could that the manuscript was not to, be had for less than the sum he had repeatedly named, and that he could, do nothing more for her. Thereupon she answered that she would consider, the matter, and did not write again. Pietro, after waiting several days\\n\\nTo break my own if I lose you--Lose you? No--do not start.,     You angel--you bitter-sweet creature of heaven, I love you and hate,       you!,     For I know what you are, and I know that my sin cannot mate you.,     I know you are better than I--by the blessing of God!--,     And I hate what is better than I by the blessing of God!,     What right has the Being Magnificent, reigning supreme\\n\\nShe and Francesco reached the castle in the afternoon of the day, following their visit to Laura Arden. The weather was fine and the, westering sun streamed through the broad windows and lent everything a, passing air of life and almost of gaiety. During the first hours, Adele, felt that she must soon be better, and that she could find some rest at, last in the atmosphere which recalled her childish days and all her, peaceful girlhood.\\n\\nNearly a month had passed when Ghisleri was at last admitted to see, Laura. He found her lying upon the same sofa on which she had slept a, few hours during the memorable night before her husband died. She was, even thinner now, he thought, and her eyes seemed to be set deeper than, ever, while her face was almost transparent in its pallor. But the look, was different--it was that of a person growing stronger rather than of, one breaking down under a heavy strain. She held out her hand to him and, looked up with a faint smile as he came to her side. The greeting was, not a very cordial one, and Ghisleri felt a slight shock as he realised, the fact.\\n\\n\\\"Then remember it. Be sure of what you mean and of yourself, if you, can,--be quite, quite sure. You know what it would mean to me to break., I have not even a little child to love me, as Laura Arden has. I shall, have nothing when you are gone--nothing but the memory of all the wrong, I have done, all that can never be undone in this world or the next.\\\"\\n\\nlike an anapaest--and the sharp click of the stick between. She tried to, look behind her, but her blood froze in her veins, and she could not, move. Every instant increased her agony of fear. A moment more and, Herbert Arden would be upon her. Suddenly a second echo, that of, Francesco Savelli's firm, quick step reached her ears. Then she heard, voices, and as the curtain was lifted she recognised the tones of old, Giacomo, the lame warder, who had met her husband in the passage, and, was asking for the orders to be given to the carter who started for, Rome every other night and brought back such provisions as could not be, obtained in Gerano.\\n\\nHe stood at his open window early in the morning, and gazed out at the, fresh, bright country. The delicate hand of spring had already touched, the world with colour, and the breath of the coming warmth had waked the, life in all those things which die yearly, and are yearly raised again., Ghisleri felt the morning sun upon his thin, pale face, and he realised, that he also had been very near to death during the dark months, and he, remembered how he had wished that he might be not near only to dying\",\n          \"\\u201cI know he got a promise from Clarice to obey,\\u201d he thought. \\u201cI saw how, the image held her in its power. But that is as far as I have been able, to go. I may even be wrong in supposing the girl will come to-night. But, I think not. Let me see, they are all going to a ball to-night, Bentham, told me. That means they will leave home about eleven o\\u2019clock. It isn\\u2019t, ten yet. Can it be possible that she would come here first?\\u201d\\n\\nSeveral times in the past attempts had been made to wrest the district, leadership from him, but in all those cases his opponents had been so, weak, and their campaigns so poorly organized, that he had been able to, defeat them without much effort. The Honorable Sugden Lawrence, he had, reason to believe, would prove a much more formidable foeman. The, ex-judge possessed a personality which made him an opponent to be feared, even by so powerful a boss as Samuel J. Coggswell. Therefore the latter, had spoken with the utmost sincerity when he told Jake Hines that he, would miss him. He feared that in order to win, much dirty work would, have to be done; and Boss Coggswell disliked dirty work--when he had to, do it himself. It would have been so much pleasanter to have the, indefatigable Jake on hand to take care of the hiring of \\u201cguerrillas,\\u201d, the \\u201cfixing\\u201d of election inspectors, and various other details of a, similarly sordid and disagreeable character which Jake had always taken, care of so faithfully.\\n\\n\\u201cNow is the time,\\u201d thought Patsy. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do what he says about going, behind this big brass dub of an idol. But, first of all, I\\u2019ve got a, little private business of my own to pull off. I didn\\u2019t see anybody in, the kitchen when I came through. I hope it will be the same now. If it, isn\\u2019t---- Well, the chief said I wasn\\u2019t to mind getting into a scrap, when it was forced on me. I\\u2019d just like to land on that black guy who, let me in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t want to be recognized, eh?\\u201d smiled Bentham. \\u201cWhy? You don\\u2019t think, there will be anybody there who would be afraid of you as Nicholas, Carter, the detective, do you? Ched Ramar is a man who moves in the, highest circles and is known all over India. His house, in Brooklyn, Heights, is one that questionable characters would find it hard to, enter. He has two tall men of his own race perpetually on guard at his, door--besides many other servants engaged in this country.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019ll stay till I\\u2019ve looked at all of them. I hope you won\\u2019t think, I\\u2019m a coward. When I said I was afraid I meant that I felt a sort of, awe. I should think most persons would experience some such feeling on, beholding all these strange figures for the first time. No doubt, if I, lived in Tibet, or wherever these images come from, I should regard them, only with reverence, and believe in them as sacred guardians, like the, others who have been familiar with them from childhood.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d answered Dallas, \\u201cwhen the letter carrier opened the box and took, out the mail, and I caught sight of that square, pink envelope lying on, top of the heap, I jumped to the conclusion that it was mine, and I, grabbed it and hurried away, fearing that he might change his mind about, giving it to me. You see, Owen, I was very much excited. The letter, which I had received from my scapegrace brother that day was very, startling. It informed me that he was in great trouble, and was about to, do something desperate--the letter didn\\u2019t state what--and that the only, thing which could prevent him from taking this step was my coming to, Chicago immediately. It warned me, too, that I mustn\\u2019t let a soul in New, York know where I was going.\\u201d\\n\\nJust as the train which was to carry him off to prison was about to pull, out of the station, Jake received a visit from the man in whom he had, such faith. Coggswell rarely yielded to sentiment when it was against, his interest to do so, but in this instance, although he realized that, he could ill afford to be seen shaking hands with the convicted man, he, decided that the latter\\u2019s loyalty in refusing to \\u201csqueal\\u201d was deserving, of this tribute; so he was there to say farewell to his faithful, henchman.\\n\\nThe figure reached almost from floor to ceiling, so that the sapphire, was very high. If one wished to look at the jewel at close range--and, most persons who entered this room did want to do so--he had to climb a, small stepladder which stood conveniently at one side. Nick saw the girl, looking at this ladder, and he was about to make his presence known so, that he could move it for her, when she carried it over herself to the, front of the image and placed it firmly for use.\\n\\nProfessor Botkins tells of a remarkable instance of intelligence, exhibited by a garden toad. He was watching the efforts of his pet toad, to capture a very large worm. The toad had been sitting still, and, giving no sign that it saw anything. The worm gave a little wriggle as, it began to come out of the ground, when, quick as a flash the toad made, a leap, and seized the end of the worm in its mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cAn employment agency in New York. He had been a valet for a theatrical, man before he came to me. But he didn\\u2019t like traveling, and he was, willing to do the menial work I require rather than go on the road, again. He wanted to stay in New York, so that he could study more, conveniently. He is a bright chap, and he speaks German and French, as, well as English and his own native tongue.\\u201d\\n\\nChester Tupper, of Paternos, Wash., was riding through the orchard of C., J. Stiner in pursuit of some cattle, when his horse broke through a, hidden well, which had been dug to a depth of sixty feet and then, covered with loose boards. Tupper threw himself clear of the saddle and, saved himself. The horse went down, but somehow managed to keep his head, above the water. A tripod was rigged with pulley and snatch block. A, team was hitched to this and the horse was brought safely to the, surface.\\n\\nHe came back to Whitewater, and all went well for a dozen years. Last, week Mr. Williams began to complain of headaches, and on Tuesday started, for Janesville on some legal business. He disappeared exactly as he had, twenty years ago. And the strange display of his dual personality was, that he immediately went to Merriville, Ind., and tried to get work at, the same farm where he was found after his first disappearance.\\n\\n\\u201cHe has proved an alibi--without trying to do so. He mentioned that he, was visiting a fellow countryman of his who is employed at Yonkers, and, that he did not get home till two o\\u2019clock this morning. This friend of, his is in the service of a friend of mine, and I had him on the, telephone just before I came out this afternoon. Swagara did not leave, the house in Yonkers till one o\\u2019clock. He and his chum sat in the, kitchen, talking till that hour. My friend happened to have company\\n\\n\\u201cThe greatest tragedy is that, while under the dominion of another\\u2019s, will, the hypnotic subject has no realization of its doings, and, when, consciousness returns, no remembrance. Well, if Ched Ramar is taking, advantage of that young girl\\u2019s innocence of the ways of the world to, make her do things she would shrink from under ordinary circumstances, I, don\\u2019t think it will be well for Ched Ramar. In fact---- Hello! What\\u2019s, the trouble now? Here comes Chick!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhile Chick is talking to Swagara, will you have the cook and Mary up, here? I should like to question them in the presence of each other. No,\\u201d, continued Nick, with a smile, as he saw a peculiar expression in Matthew, Bentham\\u2019s face, \\u201cit isn\\u2019t that I want them to contradict each other, and, so prove that they are not telling the truth. In their nervousness they, are likely to tell different stories. My object is to get at the exact, truth by letting one remind the other of details she may have forgotten., I believe both those young women are honest.\\u201d\\n\\nand I was awfully scared. But I didn\\u2019t very well see how I could get out, to him, because\\u201d--she hesitated, and blushed painfully--\\u201cbecause I--I, didn\\u2019t have the fare, Owen. I had been sending more than I could spare, to Chester recently, to help him to get out of a scrape, and I was very, hard up. So I had to write him that I was very sorry, but I really, couldn\\u2019t come to Chicago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, indeed,\\u201d replied Bentham, with a slight smile, as he shook his, head. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t suppose I should receive the head of the Yellow Tong in, my house without knowing who he was? This Professor Ning Po--or whatever, his name was--did not look the kind of man to be connected with such an, infamous organization. He was a very mild sort of man, blinking behind, large spectacles, and a decidedly entertaining personage.\\u201d\\n\\n, The young politician took his medicine with a stoicism worthy of a, better cause. There was actually a broad grin on his beefy face as he, heard the judge utter the words which condemned him to several years, behind prison bars. But it was not wholly stoicism. His attitude was, partly due to the fact that even at that desperate stage of the game he, had not quite lost faith in the power of his master and mentor to aid, him.\\n\\n1--The Man from Nowhere., 2--The Face at the Window., 3--A Fight for a Million., 4--Nick Carter\\u2019s Land Office., 5--Nick Carter and the Professor., 6--Nick Carter as a Mill Hand., 7--A Single Clew., 8--The Emerald Snake., 9--The Currie Outfit., 10--Nick Carter and the Kidnaped Heiress., 11--Nick Carter Strikes Oil., 12--Nick Carter\\u2019s Hunt for a Treasure., 13--A Mystery of the Highway., 14--The Silent Passenger., 15--Jack Dreen\\u2019s Secret., 16--Nick Carter\\u2019s Pipe Line Case., 17--Nick Carter and the Gold Thieves., 18--Nick Carter\\u2019s Auto Chase., 19--The Corrigan Inheritance., 20--The Keen Eye of Denton., 21--The Spider\\u2019s Parlor., 22--Nick Carter\\u2019s Quick Guess., 23--Nick Carter and the Murderess., 24--Nick Carter and the Pay Car., 25--The Stolen Antique., 26--The Crook League., 27--An English Cracksman., 28--Nick Carter\\u2019s Still Hunt., 29--Nick Carter\\u2019s Electric Shock., 30--Nick Carter and the Stolen Duchess., 31--The Purple Spot., 32--The Stolen Groom., 33--The Inverted Cross., 34--Nick Carter and Keno McCall., 35--Nick Carter\\u2019s Death Trap., 36--Nick Carter\\u2019s Siamese Puzzle., 37--The Man Outside., 38--The Death Chamber., 39--The Wind and the Wire., 40--Nick Carter\\u2019s Three Cornered Chase., 41--Dazaar, the Arch-Fiend., 42--The Queen of the Seven., 43--Crossed Wires., 44--A Crimson Clew., 45--The Third Man., 46--The Sign of the Dagger., 47--The Devil Worshipers., 48--The Cross of Daggers., 49--At Risk of Life., 50--The Deeper Game., 51--The Code Message., 52--The Last of the Seven., 53--Ten-Ichi, the Wonderful., 54--The Secret Order of Associated Crooks., 55--The Golden Hair Clew., 56--Back From the Dead., 57--Through Dark Ways., 58--When Aces Were Trumps., 59--The Gambler\\u2019s Last Hand., 60--The Murder at Linden Fells., 61--A Game for Millions., 62--Under Cover., 63--The Last Call., 64--Mercedes Danton\\u2019s Double., 65--The Millionaire\\u2019s Nemesis., 66--A Princess of the Underworld., 67--The Crook\\u2019s Blind., 68--The Fatal Hour., 69--Blood Money., 70--A Queen of Her Kind., 71--Isabel Benton\\u2019s Trump Card., 72--A Princess of Hades., 73--A Prince of Plotters., 74--The Crook\\u2019s Double., 75--For Life and Honor., 76--A Compact With Dazaar., 77--In the Shadow of Dazaar., 78--The Crime of a Money King., 79--Birds of Prey., 80--The Unknown Dead., 81--The Severed Hand., 82--The Terrible Game of Millions., 83--A Dead Man\\u2019s Power., 84--The Secrets of an Old House., 85--The Wolf Within., 86--The Yellow Coupon., 87--In the Toils., 88--The Stolen Radium., 89--A Crime in Paradise., 90--Behind Prison Bars., 91--The Blind Man\\u2019s Daughter., 92--On the Brink of Ruin., 93--Letter of Fire., 94--The $100,000 Kiss., 95--Outlaws of the Militia., 96--The Opium-Runners., 97--In Record Time., 98--The Wag-Nuk Clew., 99--The Middle Link., 100--The Crystal Maze., 101--A New Serpent in Eden., 102--The Auburn Sensation., 103--A Dying Chance., 104--The Gargoni Girdle., 105--Twice in Jeopardy., 106--The Ghost Launch., 107--Up in the Air., 108--The Girl Prisoner., 109--The Red Plague., 110--The Arson Trust., 111--The King of the Firebugs., 112--\\u201cLifter\\u2019s\\u201d of the Lofts., 113--French Jimmie and His Forty Thieves., 114--The Death Plot., 115--The Evil Formula., 116--The Blue Button., 117--The Deadly Parallel., 118--The Vivisectionists., 119--The Stolen Brain., 120--An Uncanny Revenge., 121--The Call of Death., 122--The Suicide., 123--Half a Million Ransom., 124--The Girl Kidnaper., 125--The Pirate Yacht., 126--The Crime of the White Hand., 127--Found in the Jungle., 128--Six Men in a Loop., 129--The Jewels of Wat Chang., 130--The Crime in the Tower., 131--The Fatal Message., 132--Broken Bars., 133--Won by Magic., 134--The Secret of Shangore., 135--Straight to the Goal., 136--The Man They Held Back., 137--The Seal of Gijon., 138--The Traitors of the Tropics., 139--The Pressing Peril., 140--The Melting-Pot., 141--The Duplicate Night., 142--The Edge of a Crime., 143--The Sultan\\u2019s Pearls., 144--The Clew of the White Collar.\\n\\nWhat worried Boss Coggswell most of all was the fear that he would not, be able to carry out successfully on election day the corrupt practices, which now constituted his only hope of winning.

Of this, number only sixty-seven were equipped with lightning rods.

There is much activity in the Wentworth district, where her, interests are located, and she is carrying on operations on a big scale., One of her many mining properties comprises one hundred and sixty acres., The biggest mine in that district is owned by her. Much of her land is, subleased.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Morrison--who was a good woman in her way, and devoted much, time to the poor and sick of New York--would not let him off. They got, to the house of Ched Ramar without Clarice getting an opportunity to, throw in more than a few words here and there, and he did not see her, again until they were in the handsomely furnished reception rooms of the, Indian scholar, and were looking at the curiosities on all sides.\\n\\nHalf an hour later he was explaining to the reporter what was required, of him. The latter was to earn the twenty dollars by interviewing a firm, of lawyers named Hodginson & Lehman, and a young woman named Miss, Marjorie Dorman, if he could find her. He was to ask them about a, breach-of-promise suit which the Honorable Sugden Lawrence had settled, out of court by the payment of thirty thousand dollars.\\n\\n\\u201cEvidently your informant hasn\\u2019t kept you well posted,\\u201d Owen replied, dryly. \\u201cI was ordered there, but I was called back. You see, Mr., Coggswell, you are not the only man who has a pull at Washington. My, friend Judge Lawrence has a friend there who is quite influential in, post-office affairs. He lives at the White House. When he heard that the, judge needed me here, he was kind enough to countermand that transfer, order.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes. I looked a few minutes ago, to make sure. Somehow, I hate to leave, it in the house when I am away. It is something I never have done, before. Still, I am not afraid it will be found--even if my burglar, should come while I am away. He may do that, if he is keeping as close a, watch on me as I think he must. I have too much faith in my hiding, place.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is the truth,\\u201d Inspector Sheridan returned quietly. \\u201cThe speech you, have just made on this platform is enough to convict you. But, in, addition to that, I have arrested the carrier who handed the letter to, your man, Bill Hillman, and I have a complete confession from him. We, have such a good case, Boss Coggswell, that we are fully confident of, the result. Not only are you going to lose the leadership of this, district, but you are going away for a few years to keep your friend and, accomplice, Jake Hines, company in prison.\\u201d\\n\\nBut, although he was an eloquent speaker, he was forced to realize that, his oratory could not save the day. His audiences smiled skeptically, when he protested that he had had nothing to do with the desperate, attempt to railroad young Sheridan to jail. They smiled still more, incredulously when he denied Judge Lawrence\\u2019s charge that he had derived, revenue from the sale of tickets for the various outings of the Samuel, J.

The snake had swallowed an egg on the \\u201cnear\\u201d, side of the fence and then had poked its head through the crack and, swallowed another egg. With two eggs in its throat, one on each side of, the crack, the snake was a prisoner. Moriarity killed the snake but did, not rescue the eggs.\\n\\n\\u201cActually, Mr. Carter, I cannot tell. I must have been so absorbed in my, own thoughts that I didn\\u2019t notice how far the car went, or where I left, it. All I know is that I found myself at home again after a while, and, that I got off the car that brought me here at the corner, two blocks, down our avenue. I had been thinking about various things the whole, time, and I had performed my whole journey mechanically.

In other words, the, invention is all that is claimed for it, and it makes it possible for a, man or a body of men to disappear in a twinkling. Mr. Comerford has, given several demonstrations of the invention to his friends, who say, that it will revolutionize modern warfare.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you quite sure that you have the goods on Judge Lawrence regarding, that breach-of-promise case?\\u201d asked Sheridan, with a quizzical smile., \\u201cPerhaps you are mistaken, Coggswell. Perhaps the judge is not quite the, rascal you have painted him. It is true that he is acquainted with a, young person named Marjorie Dorman. It is also true that he is very fond, of her. But it is not true that he has ever asked her to marry him. As a, matter of fact, she is not quite old enough to consider a proposal of, that sort. She is only six years old. She is the judge\\u2019s little niece.\\u201d\\n\\nNick did not believe Ched Ramar was the person he pretended to be. He, doubted even whether he were an Indian at all. Well did the detective, know the almost diabolical skill of the notorious Sang Tu, head of the, Yellow Tong, and it would not surprise him at all to find that Ched, Ramar was carrying out the behests of the unscrupulous Celestial in, obtaining his strange power over Clarice Bentham.\\n\\nBoss Coggswell frowned. \\u201cYoung man, you had better be careful. I warn, you that if you go ahead with this foolishness the consequences will be, most disastrous to you. I presume this is a piece of spite work on the, part of my opponent. No doubt he has heard that I\\u2019ve got the goods on, him regarding that breach-of-promise case, and he thinks he\\u2019ll be able, to square himself with the voters of this district by making this, outrageous move.\\u201d\\n\\nThis was all shooting in the dark for Nick Carter. But he knew the ways, of Ched Ramar. He had not been idle all day, and he had found out from a, friend of his at police headquarters considerably about Ched Ramar\\u2019s, methods. It is a way the police have--that of making a few secret, inquiries about mysterious foreigners in New York who have plenty of, money and no particular apparent business.\\n\\n\\u201cI shall not rest until I have satisfied myself on several points that, have a direct bearing on the mystery. I am in hopes that when I have, done that, I shall have a report for you that will be valuable. I cannot, say any more than that at this stage. I will call you up as soon as I, have something to communicate. Meanwhile, I should advise you not to, walk about the streets or go into public places much.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy friends, as you all know, since the start of this contest I have, deplored personal attacks. I have raised my voice in protest against the, outrageous mud slinging indulged in by my opponent and his misguided, friends. But inasmuch as they have persisted in their shameful abuse of, a man who for seventeen years has worked night and day to serve the, people of this district, I feel justified in showing you that we can do, a little mud slinging, too. I am going to handle this Mr. Justice, Lawrence without gloves. I am going to show him to you in his true, colors.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Carroll\\u2019s mother lived at what is now Thirteenth and Farnam, Streets. At that time it was neither Thirteenth nor Farnam. It was just, a place in the hills, prairie and timber. The present Mrs. Carroll was, about three years of age. Her mother employed a young Indian squaw as a, domestic. All was fine, but the domestic didn\\u2019t like to work. She liked, to play with the baby, however. The baby took a great liking to the, brown maid.\\n\\n714--The Taxicab Riddle., 717--The Master Rogue\\u2019s Alibi., 719--The Dead Letter., 720--The Allerton Millions., 728--The Mummy\\u2019s Head., 729--The Statue Clue., 730--The Torn Card., 731--Under Desperation\\u2019s Spur., 732--The Connecting Link., 733--The Abduction Syndicate., 736--The Toils of a Siren., 738--A Plot Within a Plot., 739--The Dead Accomplice., 741--The Green Scarab., 746--The Secret Entrance., 747--The Cavern Mystery., 748--The Disappearing Fortune., 749--A Voice from the Past., 752--The Spider\\u2019s Web., 753--The Man With a Crutch., 754--The Rajah\\u2019s Regalia., 755--Saved from Death., 756--The Man Inside., 757--Out for Vengeance., 758--The Poisons of Exili., 759--The Antique Vial., 760--The House of Slumber., 761--A Double Identity., 762--\\u201cThe Mocker\\u2019s\\u201d Stratagem., 763--The Man that Came Back., 764--The Tracks in the Snow., 765--The Babbington Case., 766--The Masters of Millions., 767--The Blue Stain., 768--The Lost Clew., 770--The Turn of a Card., 771--A Message in the Dust., 772--A Royal Flush., 774--The Great Buddha Beryl., 775--The Vanishing Heiress., 776--The Unfinished Letter., 777--A Difficult Trail., 782--A Woman\\u2019s Stratagem., 783--The Cliff Castle Affair., 784--A Prisoner of the Tomb., 785--A Resourceful Foe., 789--The Great Hotel Tragedies., 795--Zanoni, the Transfigured., 796--The Lure of Gold., 797--The Man With a Chest., 798--A Shadowed Life., 799--The Secret Agent., 800--A Plot for a Crown., 801--The Red Button., 802--Up Against It., 803--The Gold Certificate., 804--Jack Wise\\u2019s Hurry Call., 805--Nick Carter\\u2019s Ocean Chase., 807--Nick Carter\\u2019s Advertisement., 808--The Kregoff Necklace., 811--Nick Carter and the Nihilists., 812--Nick Carter and the Convict Gang., 813--Nick Carter and the Guilty Governor., 814--The Triangled Coin., 815--Ninety-nine--and One., 816--Coin Number 77.\\n\\nand realized the mistake I had made, I was in a quandary. The, hundred-dollar bill and the letter which the envelope contained were, each in four pieces. I was afraid to go to the post office and explain, how it had happened, because I knew that if I did so it would get, Carrier Andrews into trouble for violating the rules. So I decided to, cut some sticking plaster into small strips, and paste the pieces, together. I made quite a neat job of it; then I addressed a fresh, envelope, inclosed the patched-up letter and hundred-dollar bill, and, dropped it into a mail box.\\u201d\\n\\nAs the detective moved about with the others, looking at the many, curious idols of various metals that were disposed about the great, rooms, and answering readily to his assumed name of Doctor Hodgson, he, seemed not to have any interest outside of what he was inspecting with, the other guests. But his gaze never left the swarthy face of Ched Ramar, for more than a few seconds at a time.\\n\\n\\u201cAny thief who thinks he can get it, is welcome to try,\\u201d he said, with, great confidence. \\u201cThis Buddha is able to take care of itself and of, everything it possesses. You remember what I said just now--that it is, supposed to be endowed with strange powers. But let me show you, something else. I am rather proud of this room. It contains the finest, specimens in my collection of antiques.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe has a room in a street off Fulton, down near Borough Hall, Maggie, says. That\\u2019s all she knows about it. Of course, I had to get all this, out of her by degrees, and under the seal of confidence. I tried to make, a good impression on Maggie,\\u201d continued Chick, with a grin, \\u201cand I, flatter myself she thinks I\\u2019m all right. I told her I was your clerk\\n\\n\\u201cYes. There are not many things would have made me trouble you at this, time of the morning, so you can easily guess. I was tired when I got, home last night, after that reception at Ched Ramar\\u2019s, or I would have, looked then to see that the records were safe. But I went to the place, where I had put them the first thing this morning, even before, breakfast.\\u201d\\n\\n, After Owen had seen Jake Hines safely locked up in a local police, station, he went back to Dallas to fulfill this mission which had, brought him to Chicago. \\u201cI want you to explain to me about that letter, you got from the mail box,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou got the wrong letter by a, mistake, of course? Instead of the one which you had mailed to your, brother, you got the pink envelope which the Reverend Doctor Moore, dropped into the box?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat has never been found out. Two men concerned in the murder have, paid the penalty. But the one at the back of it all is still at large., We shall get him, but we haven\\u2019t done it yet. I only mentioned this to, convince you that the power which put Andrew Anderton out of the world, is not likely to hesitate at breaking into your house and stealing the, records that were the cause of his assassination.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI beg your pardon for laughing, Miss Bentham,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut, really, I, had never thought of my poor idols in that light before. These things, that so many thousands of people in Asia believe can save them from all, ill, and bring succor to them in distress--surely ought not to frighten, any one, even an American young lady. But, if you are timid, why, I\\u2019ll, take you down at once.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe idea was to set a little trap for you,\\u201d Owen explained. \\u201cAs I said, before, the judge has had cause to suspect for some time that his mail, was being tampered with--that somebody was steaming open the envelopes, and reading their contents before they were delivered to him. He put the, matter in my hands, and we decided to make a little test to ascertain, whether his suspicions were correct. We fixed up a decoy letter. It told, of an imaginary check for thirty thousand dollars which the judge paid, to settle an imaginary breach-of-promise suit. It was sent to the judge, through the mails, and was intercepted in the usual way by you\\n\\n\\u201cIt was something like that,\\u201d confessed Swagara. \\u201cBut not quite. Ched, Ramar saw me in a restaurant on the East Side of New York, where I, sometimes play chess. He is a chess player, and he got into conversation, with me one night. It ended in my saying I wanted employment, and, soon--I don\\u2019t know how it was--I found myself engaged by him. I keep his, rooms in order, and I do anything he tells me.\\u201d\\n\\nBoss Coggswell was disappointed, but not dismayed. \\u201cI scarcely expected, that you\\u2019d be able to make them talk,\\u201d he told his newspaper friend;, \\u201cbut I thought it was worth trying. Of course, the more details I could, get about the case the better. However, I have enough information for my, purpose. Come around to Colfax Hall to-night, and you\\u2019ll see some fun., I\\u2019m going to address a big meeting there--the biggest of the whole, campaign--and I\\u2019m going to hand a big jolt to my dear friend the judge., I don\\u2019t imagine that he\\u2019ll be as popular with the voters of this, district after I get through with him. If you can\\u2019t come yourself, you\\u2019d, better see that your paper sends another man to cover the meeting. I\\u2019m, going to notify all the other papers. I want every sheet in town to, print my speech.\\u201d\\n\\n, When it comes to detective stories worth while, the =Nick Carter Stories=, contain the only ones that should be considered. They are not overdrawn, tales of bloodshed. They rather show the working of one of the finest, minds ever conceived by a writer. The name of Nick Carter is familiar, all over the world, for the stories of his adventures may be read in, twenty languages. No other stories have withstood the severe test of, time so well as those contained in the =Nick Carter Stories=. It proves, conclusively that they are the best. We give herewith a list of some of, the back numbers in print. You can have your news dealer order them, or, they will be sent direct by the publishers to any address upon receipt, of the price in money or postage stamps.\\n\\nThere was a rescue. But it never got into the papers. There were no, papers to print thrilling adventures that occurred around the Missouri, River bluffs in those days. The mother, Mrs. John Godola, walked right, out of the house, stopped the squaw, and took the child away from her., If it were to-day, the movies would have a thriller on the screen about, it. But that was before Edison or any one else had thought of making, pictures walk and talk; also, those were the days when experience with, the Indians were many and grotesque. A mere kidnaping did not attract, much attention.\\n\\n\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t find that out. Maggie seems to be afraid to say much about, Ched. All she has been told is that he is a millionaire, and she has, that only on the strength of the jewelry he wears when he goes out, and, the fact that swell people visit him. He has not lived at that house, very long. When he moved in, about six weeks ago, all the things he, brought with him were truckloads of big packing cases. Some of these, were as big as a house, according to Maggie\\u2019s cousin--or sister. When, all those were in, furniture came from some big store. It was all new\\n\\nPickels has commanded her. She was designed for work in Northern waters., As the bronze plate in the captain\\u2019s cabin sets forth, she was presented, to Doctor Wilfred Grenfell in July, 1911, by George B. Cluett. That she, went to sea with purposes other than those of the ordinary trading, schooner, the plate makes plain in these few words: \\u201cThe Sea is His and, He Made It.\\u201d The inscription in the brass band which binds the wheel\\n\\nWhen Julia was brought here in connection with the effort to raise funds, for Hose Truck No. 2, her fierce, untamed conduct, coupled with the fact, that she was said to have two teeth, made the firemen fearful for the, safety of their friends, who, after paying their admission, foolishly, insisted upon feeding peanuts and stick caramels to the evil-eyed, man-eater. The situation became so desperate that Julia growled every, time she woke up--about twice a day.\\n\\n\\u201cMY DEAR JUDGE: I beg to acknowledge receipt of your check for,      thirty thousand dollars, in full settlement of the claims of our,      client, Miss Marjorie Dorman. In consideration of this payment our,      client agrees to abandon her action against you for breach of,      promise of marriage, and to return all letters written to her by,      you. Formal agreement to this effect will be mailed to you under,      separate cover.\\n\\n\\u201cBless me!\\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly drawing back with affected, astonishment after he had completed this operation. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a postage, stamp on this envelope, Bill--an uncanceled stamp. Queer that I didn\\u2019t, notice it before. It looked as if this letter must have somehow dropped, out of the mail. You\\u2019d better take it right away and hand it to a letter, carrier. As good citizens, Bill, it is our duty to see that the United, States mails are not delayed any longer than is absolutely necessary.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t mind the change at all,\\u201d said Owen to Judge Lawrence. \\u201cIt, will be a nice honeymoon trip for us\\u201d--for the transfer order reached, him on the very day of his marriage to Dallas--\\u201cbut I hate the idea of, being away from New York while you are waging your primary battle, against that crook. I was in hopes that I would be able to repay a, little of what you have done for me by helping you in your campaign.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat Buddha and other things in this room will interest you for some, time, Miss Bentham, I have no doubt,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I can hardly remain, away from my guests. I will leave you alone. When you are ready to come, down, you know how to work the elevator. Although it is possible that, some of the other ladies below will be up to see the idols before you, have finished looking at them.\\u201d\\n\\nCoggswell grew more and more alarmed by the strength which his opponent, displayed. Word reached him that the voters of the district were, flocking by thousands to the ex-jurist\\u2019s banner. Men who had never taken, the trouble to vote at a primary election before were taking a keen, interest in this fight. Judge Lawrence was conducting a whirlwind, campaign, and his forceful oratory had the district stirred as it had, never been stirred before.\\n\\nAlthough the proved nimbleness of the _Cluett_ leads her charterers to, hope that she may slip in and out with the rescued MacMillan party in, time to get back to New York in November, the way food supplies have, been poured into her show that no chances are to be taken in a locality, where, as the captain remarked, \\u201cye can\\u2019t fetch stuff from a grocery, \\u2019round the corner.\\u2019\\u201d He shed light upon what for a dozen men might be, considered a two years\\u2019 food supply. Some two thousand pounds of beef\\n\\nHe was afraid, however, to bring about the dismissal of the man before, primary-election day; he knew that if he did so Judge Lawrence would not, fail to make political capital out of the incident; so he decided to, wait until the contest for the district leadership was over. In the, meantime, for safety\\u2019s sake, he contrived to have Sheridan transferred, from the New York district. This he could bring about without laying, himself open to the charge of persecution. A little wire pulling at, Washington, and, without Boss Coggswell\\u2019s name being mentioned in the, matter at all, Owen received peremptory orders to report to the chief, inspector of the San Francisco branch.\\n\\nIt was at this moment that Chick came into the library, attired as a, Chinaman of the poorer class. He wore the blue blouse and trousers, common to laundrymen in America, and his face was of the pale yellow, that is always associated with Mongolians in the average mind. He wore a, large, soft black hat, which completely concealed his head. He wore a, wig, with a queue, but it was not convincing if closely examined, and, Nick Carter had told him to keep on his hat under all circumstances.\\n\\n\\u201cLook here, Carter!\\u201d interrupted Bentham impatiently. \\u201cThis is sheer, waste of time. What if my daughter did take an early-morning walk? There, is nothing remarkable in that. She is a healthy young girl, with a love, of nature. When can you enjoy nature better than in the beginning of a, fine day? But it has nothing to do with this loss of my papers. How, could it have any bearing on such a matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know. I got a card addressed to me. But there is a line, on the card to the effect that any friend of mine will be welcome. It is, written in pencil. The remainder of the card is lithographed. If you, would like to go, I should be pleased to take you in. My daughter is, going, with her aunt, Mrs. Morrison. She is Clarice\\u2019s mother\\u2019s sister.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen, half an hour later, the party left the house, the two ladies had, the magnificently carved jade vases to which Ched Ramar had referred., But Clarice held clasped to her bosom, as if she feared she might lose, it, the gold idol that seemed to have been merely an uncontemplated, gift, but which Nick Carter remembered had been promised to her by the, strange voice from the lips of the gigantic Buddha.\\n\\n\\u201cI won\\u2019t be in the jug long,\\u201d he declared confidently to the deputy, sheriff who led him, shackled, out of the courtroom. \\u201cBoss Coggswell, will get me out. His pull will win me a pardon, all right. So long as, he\\u2019s my friend I\\u2019m not worryin\\u2019. And not only will he get me free,\\u201d he, added, a glint coming into his beady eyes, \\u201cbut you can bet he\\u2019ll make, it hot for everybody that\\u2019s had a hand in sending me up. That judge\\u2019ll, get his for handing me such a stiff sentence; the district attorney will, be made to regret that he wouldn\\u2019t let up when the boss gave him the, hint; and as for that big stiff of a Sheridan--well, I\\u2019m willing to bet, a thousand to a hundred that he won\\u2019t be holding that inspector\\u2019s job, very long. They\\u2019ll all be made to feel that it ain\\u2019t healthy to defy a, man like Samuel J. Coggswell.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI need scarcely say,\\u201d he explained unctuously to the group of newspaper, men who were on the platform to see Hines depart, \\u201cthat there is no man, who condemns and deplores more than I the atrocious crime for which that, wretched young man is about to pay the penalty. Still, I cannot quite, forget the time when poor, misguided Jake Hines was an honest man, who, enjoyed my esteem and friendship. It is in memory of those days\\n\\n\\u201cI know that. Ched Ramar doesn\\u2019t like his affairs talked about. But you, are quite safe here. I know Ched Ramar, and he has no secrets from me--I, mean, of an ordinary nature. You have been with him ever since he took, that house in which he lives at present--on Brooklyn Heights. You never, met him until you were recommended to him by somebody whom you do not, know. Ched Ramar has never told you how he came to know of you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe armature is less than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and the, wire is of the size of number one-hundred thread. A jeweler\\u2019s microscope, must be used to see the different parts, and the whole thing weighs only, twenty grains, or as much as a third of a teaspoonful of water. When, coupled with small dry batteries, it runs at very high velocity and, makes a noise like a fly on a windowpane.\\n\\n\\u201cI did,\\u201d she admitted readily. \\u201cProfessor Ched Ramar showed it to me, himself. He only told me that it was a fine specimen. Then he went away., When I was alone, I climbed up to look at the face of the idol, and, Doctor Hodgson, who came into the room, spoke to me about it in a, general way. Professor Ched Ramar also came in, with my aunt, Mrs., Morrison, and my father. Ched Ramar afterward gave me a small gold, idol.\\u201d\\n\\nFor some time it has been impossible for the family of James Rich, of, Fidelity, to use the stove in the summer kitchen, because the flue had, become choked in some manner. The other day Mrs. Rich noticed a cat, sitting on the stove and looking steadfastly at the stovepipe. At the, same time Mrs. Rich\\u2019s attention was attracted by a tap-tap-tapping, sound. Although the woman is not a spiritualist, she answered the three, taps by rapping on the stove with a fork handle. The taps responded from, the stovepipe.\\n\\nHillman grinned again as the boss folded the letter, replaced it in the, envelope, and carefully gummed down the flap. It had been opened by, holding it over a steaming kettle, and was necessary for Coggswell to, resort to the mucilage bottle on his desk in order to close it again. He, performed the task with a dexterity which showed that he was a master, craftsman at that sort of thing, taking great care not to invite, suspicion by applying too much mucilage.\\n\\nThe concussion was too much for Ched Ramar. It doubled him up, so that, Nick Carter got a better hold on the handle of the scimitar than he had, been able to obtain heretofore. At first he thought he had won the, weapon altogether. But Ched Ramar\\u2019s hold was too sure for that. He still, retained his grip, but not quite so good a one as he had had, because, there was not so much room for his fingers.\\n\\nWar was the first setback circus people experienced. Then came the, foot-and-mouth disease among live stock. Each at first had an indirect, result, but now the loss of foreign acrobats, animal trainers, and wild, animals, together with the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, prescribing narrow zones in which a circus can move for fear of carrying, or contracting the foot-and-mouth disease, have caused lots of trouble, for the three-ring showmen.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Doom of Sang Tu; or, Nick Carter\\u2019s Golden Foe,\\u201d will be the,      title of the long, complete story which you will find in the next,      issue, No. 153, of the NICK CARTER STORIES, out August 14th. In,      this story you will read of the great detective\\u2019s ultimate triumph,      over the shrewd leader of the Yellow Tong. Then, too, you will also,      find an installment of a new serial, together with several other,      articles of interest.\\n\\nor a sense of justice, but because she had started a suit for breach of, promise against him, and he was afraid of the scandal. He was afraid of, being shown up to his fellow men in his true colors, so he paid her, thirty thousand dollars hush money to call off the suit. The name of, this young woman is Miss Marjorie Dorman. I challenge the _Honorable_, Sugden Lawrence to deny these facts.\\u201d The speaker placed withering, emphasis upon the word honorable. \\u201cI challenge him to deny that he paid, that money to prevent the breach-of-promise suit from going to court.\\u201d\\n\\n, The opportunity which came to Boss Coggswell was in the form of a, letter. Bill Hillman brought it to him as he sat in his private office, at the headquarters of the Samuel J. Coggswell Association. Hillman was, one of his henchmen, who, during the enforced absence of Jake Hines, had, been chosen by the boss to fill that unfortunate young man\\u2019s place as, his confidential man. He was not as able a worker as Jake, judged by the, standard which had made the latter so useful to his chief, but he, combined the qualities of shrewdness, audacity, and unscrupulousness to, a greater degree than anybody else in the organization; therefore\\n\\nThe judge made it a point to go extensively into the details of those, notorious outings. He quoted figures to show that at each outing the, sale of tickets had brought in several thousand dollars more than the, total expenses. He charged that this surplus had gone into the boss\\u2019, coffers, and exposed the blackmailing methods by which Jake Hines and, the other lieutenants had forced the reluctant civil-service employees, and business men of the district to take tickets. It made excellent, campaign material.\\n\\nHe is thirty-six years of age and has a wife and seven children. He, attended the Indian school at Genoa, Neb., three years and attended, school at Carlisle, Pa., in the year 1902. While he was a student there, during that year he played center on the famous Indian football team. He, then weighed two hundred and five pounds. He has written some newspaper, articles on Indian clan organizations and Indian burial customs, and has, co\\u00f6perated with the government in anthropological research.\",\n          \"\\\"There'll be some little chance of their swimmin' ashore if they haven't, got too many clothes on,\\\" Uncle Zenas replied mournfully, and then he, raised his head quickly as the muffled report of the gun could be heard., \\\"I'm proud of 'em, Sonny, proud of 'em!

The light-house at Corunna, Spain, is,     believed to be the oldest existing light-tower. This was built in,     the reign of Trajan, and in 1634 it was reconstructed. The erection,     of the Eddystone Light-house, off Plymouth, England, formed an era,     in the construction of light-houses. The masonry was 76 feet 6,     inches, and the top of the lantern 93 feet, above the foundation.,     It was completed in 1759. The various courses were so dovetailed,     into each other, and the whole fifty so secured together, that the,     tower was almost as solid as if cut out of the solid block. Immense,     difficulties had to be overcome from the first landing on the rock,     on April 5, 1756, to the laying of the first stone, June 12, 1757\\n\\n\\\"It don't stand to reason that 'ere craft has got shipwrecked men, aboard, else we would see 'em, Sammy, an' I'm certain she's light, but, for a man in the stern-sheets.

It won't be a great while before you can run the whole, business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sammy did his full share of the work, Sonny, an' did it like a little, man,\\\" the old keeper said, continuing his story as if there had not been, any interruption. \\\"The first time we ran down, the captain of the, wrecked vessel tossed one of the men aboard us, for the poor fellow was, so far gone he couldn't help himself. The second trip we got another, passenger in the same way, an' the third venture, which was nigh bein', the last of our work, owin' to an ugly sea catchin' us when we were, within four or five feet of the wreck, the other two men jumped aboard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll allow it was a pretty tough job; but nothing to be compared, with what the Board has done in other places. Now I was reading, not a, great while ago, in one of the books the inspector sends us, about their, building a tower on a rock off the coast of Oregon called Tillamook., Putting one up here wasn't a marker alongside the trouble they had with, that, because there wasn't many days in the summer when a full crew, couldn't work here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The light is forty-eight feet above the base of the tower and 136 feet, above sea-level. It was shown for the first time on February 1, 1881. If, it had been finished a month earlier it would possibly have saved the, English iron bark _Lupata_ of 1,039 tons burden, which was dashed to, pieces on the main shore, not a mile from the light-house, with a loss, of the vessel, its freight, and every one of the twenty persons on, board. The bark came so near the rock that the creaking of the blocks, and the voices of the officers giving orders were distinctly heard, but, the night was so dark that nothing could be seen except her lights. The, superintendent of construction had a bon-fire built on the rock as soon, as possible, but the vessel was probably lost before the signal could be, seen. It was on this night that the working party lost their, supply-house and came so near losing their quarters, if not their, lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a foolish question,\\\" he said, speaking aloud as if to hear the, sound of his own voice. \\\"I've _got_ to stay, because I couldn't go away, if I was willing to leave the light alone. It isn't likely any of them, will be back before morning, and I'd be ashamed to confess that I'd made, a baby of myself at a time when it is possible to be of some service to, those who have been so kind to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One evening a fisher from Milford, who had succeeded in landing at, Smalls in an intermission of calm weather, brought to Solway the two, keepers, but one of them was a corpse. The survivor had made a coffin, for his dead comrade, then, after having carried it to a corner of the, gallery, he had stood it on end, attaching it firmly. Left alone he had, done good service. When returned on shore he was so changed, so, emaciated, that his relatives and friends could scarcely recognize him., He asserted that his comrade had died of disease; he was believed, but, after this time there were always three keepers at Smalls in the place, of two--a wise precaution which has since been taken for light-houses, placed in similar conditions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From that moment,\\\" Mr. Sawyer said as he concluded the sad story, \\\"he, remained aft in the bottom of the boat, and I was unable to arouse him., How long we drifted after that, I cannot rightly say; but when I saw you, making preparations to aid us, I tried to pull him to his feet, that he, might be in shape to help himself in some slight degree. I believe he, was already dead, and, knowing that I could not get ashore through the, surf burdened with his lifeless body, I gave no further heed to him., Even as it was, I came near drowning Mr. Peters, for the two of us were, rolled over and over half a dozen times before you pulled us to our, feet, and then I was so dazed that but for his grip on my collar I must, have fallen back into the surf.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We ran down a spar, and he was leaning over the bow trying to make out, if it was a buoy that had gone adrift, or a portion of the wreckage we, had sighted, when a heavy sea came. It seemed to me as if the timber, struck Mr. Sawyer on the head, for over he went like a log, and although, I put the boat back and forth until it grew too dark to see, I couldn't, find him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir, and I made a fool of myself by crying at first. When I got, over that it seemed as if the minutes were as long as hours, and I, wondered how I would get through the night. The worst of it all was that, I didn't believe you could get back to-night, and I knew if a storm came, you wouldn't be able to land on the ledge.\\\"\\n\\nThere is little doubt but that the early colonists recognized the,     necessity for beacons with which to guide their home-returning,     shallops to a safe anchorage, and that they took effective means to,     show the English and Dutch ships which should make their land-fall,     at night the safe way to the harbor. But the first authentic,     evidence of this being done at the public charge, is the record of,     the proceedings of the general court of the Province of,     Massachusetts Bay, from which it appears that on March 9, 1673, a,     petition came from the citizens of Nantasket, Massachusetts (now,     Hull), for the lessening of their taxes, because of the material,     and labor they had expended over and above their proportion in,     building the beacon on Point Allerton, the most prominent headland,     near the entrance to Boston harbor. At that session also it appears,     that bills were paid from Nantasket for making and furnishing,     \\\"fier-bales of pitch and ocum for the beacon at Allerton Point,\\\",     which \\\"fier-bales\\\" were burned in an iron grate or basket on the,     top of a beacon, for the building of which Nantasket had furnished,     400 boat-loads of stone.\\n\\n\\\"It strikes me that a man of your age, Cap'n Eph, could be in better, business than tellin' stories about light-houses that have been carried, away, to a lad who's gettin' his first taste of a storm in a place like, this! I wouldn't have thanked anybody for spinnin' sich yarns the first, year I came on this ledge. We didn't have a heavy sea in all that time, but I expected the tower would go, an' when a nor'easter struck us, I, allowed there wasn't any show of savin' our lives.\\\"\\n\\nSidney stood ready with the lantern curtains until the keeper should, show him how they ought to be hung, for he had come to believe there was, a rule for the most trifling labor, when an exclamation of surprise, caused him to turn toward the door in the floor, and he saw the head and, shoulders of Mr. Peters, who was surveying the scene with a comical, expression on his face.\\n\\nMr. Peters had made his way over the rocks to the very line of surf, and, stood there until the moment should come for the supreme effort, while, Uncle Zenas and Captain Eph watched his every movement closely, prepared, to slacken the rope or haul in as should be necessary when the battle, with the waves was begun. Nearly in the center of the room, but where he, could see all that took place, Sidney stood, his eyes fixed on the boat, while his hands were clenched as if by much straining of the muscles he, might aid in the coming struggle.\\n\\n\\\"What good would it do you to eat the buff-skin, Sammy?\\\" Captain Eph, asked in a mild tone, and without looking up from his task of polishing, the lenses. \\\"It stands to reason that you'd have a fit of the dyspepsy, after doin' it, an' then I'd be called upon to report that we'd lost a, buff-skin, an' the best part of Number 12 from the medicine chest, for, I'd feel it my duty to doctor you up to the best of my ability an' the, printed instructions from the Board, even though you had been makin' a, fool of yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course you couldn't have an idea that any accident would happen, because of your staying in bed as you did, and so I don't think you're, as much to blame as you make out,\\\" Sidney said earnestly. \\\"You needn't, worry that I'll ever tell Captain Eph or Uncle Zenas what you've said;, but if they knew the whole story, I'm certain neither of them would look, at it as you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I remember rightly, it was sometime in October of 1879, when the, steam tender landed four men with drills, hammers, and such like, to say, nothing of provisions, fuel, a stove, an' some canvas for them to make a, shanty of. There those poor, wretched creeters hung to the rock like, starfish, not able to do much of anything more than keep themselves from, tumbling off into the water. It was three days before they got five, other men an' a small derrick on to that blessed rock, an' for near to, two weeks they had nothin' to shelter them from the rain and the spray, but that 'ere square of canvas they had carried out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Although persons are appointed to the service and assigned to a given, station, they are frequently transferred from one station to another, as, the interest of the service may demand, and while it is usual to consult, a keeper's wishes in his assignments, there is nothing in the, regulations to prevent the transfer of a man appointed in Maine to a, station in Georgia; and occasionally keepers are, with their own, consent, transferred from one district to another at a great distance., Young men who have seen some sea service are preferred as assistants at, the larger stations; and at stations requiring but one keeper, retired, sea captains or mates who have families are frequently selected.\\n\\nA comical appearance did the lad present when he was clad in oiled, garments which had been made for the cook. It was necessary to turn back, the sleeves of the coat until he had around his wrists huge rolls of the, stiff fabric, causing Mr. Peters to remark that in case they \\\"needed, fenders for the boat it would only be necessary for Sonny to let his, arms hang over the rail.\\\" The legs of the trousers were treated in the, same manner as the sleeves, and when he was fully clad, the skirt of the, coat dragged on the ground, while the waistband of the trousers was, fastened under his arms.\\n\\nstandin' high out of fifteen fathom of water, an' a full mile from the, mainland. As I remember, it's located twenty miles south of the mouth of, the Columbia River. It seems, 'cordin' to the printed story, that that, 'ere rock was split in two, with a wide crack running east an' west, an', the top of it was about a hundred feet above the level of the sea., Nothin' larger than fifty foot square could be built on it, an' it was a, mighty ticklish job for even sailormen to get a footin' there, even in, the fairest of fair weather. Why, the foreman of the first crew that, went off was drownded when the natives thereabouts allowed that the sea, was calm. That put a damper, so to speak, on the work; but the Board was, bound to have a light there, an' when they get their minds set on a, thing, it's pretty sure to be brought about.\\n\\n, The tears nearly blinded the lad as he lighted the lamp, started the, clock, and watched to make certain it was running smoothly. Then he, raised the wick until the flame was of the same size as Captain Eph had, said was required to get the greatest amount of light without danger of, smoke, and, closing the door of the lantern softly lest the echoes, should be aroused, crept down to the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"Bless you, no, Sonny. There was the Eddystone, off Plymouth, England., It was a fanciful sort of a thing, an' disappeared during a hurricane in, the year 1703. The tower was rebuilt, an' in 1755 was burned, because, there was a good deal of wood-work inside, which you won't find in, light-houses built nowadays. That makes up the list of coast lights that, have been destroyed, so you see we needn't bother our heads about, anything of the kind happenin' here, for Carys' Ledge Light has stood, against many a worse gale than this.\\\"\\n\\nAt the same moment Captain Eph began to descend the iron stairs at the, best possible speed, and, on arriving at the landing immediately over, the kitchen, saw that which caused him to believe the disaster was, fully as great as Sidney had announced. In his eagerness he leaped, his, feet struck the stair midway from the bottom, and down he came like a, log, lying motionless on the floor as if he had been killed.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's our well,\\\" Uncle Zenas said in reply to Sidney's question., \\\"Least-ways it's a hole in the masonry which is filled every once in a, while by the water-boat from the harbor, which comes out here for that, purpose. Yonder is the oil, and our lamp eats lots of it. This 'ere is, what is known as a first order light, an' we use somewhere over eight, hundred gallons of oil in a year. The Light-House Board sends all our, supplies, for it stands to reason we can't run out to the shop whenever, we're needin' anythin' extra.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that bein' the case, Sammy, after I've entered in the watch book, an account of his comin' here, an' set down the fact that I count on, keepin' the lad till somebody comes to claim him, I reckon it's nobody's, business but mine an' the United States Government's. He's here, an', here he stays, unless the inspector says he must be turned adrift, in, which case I'll go with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Although but one grade of keeper is recognized by law, usage has, divided keepers into a number of grades, with different pay as well as, different duties, and with promotion running through the various grades., At one light-house there may be but one keeper; at another, a principal, keeper and an assistant; and there is a station where there is a, principal keeper with four assistants, the fourth having the lowest, grade and the lowest pay, and the others having been appointed at that, grade, and promoted as merit was shown and vacancies occurred; or they, may have been transferred and promoted from another station.\\n\\n\\\"We wouldn't take the value of a cent if you had all the money in the, land,\\\" Captain Eph cried emphatically. \\\"This 'ere crew tries to do its, duty by the Government, an' when that's been done, if we can work in a, little overtime, like takin' you off the wreck, we feel as if we could, look ourselves in the face knowin' we'd lent a hand when it was needed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here she is, an' there's a good bit of meanin' to it, lad. 'The lens, and the glass of the lantern must be cleaned daily and always kept in, the best possible condition. Before beginning to clean the lens it must, be brushed with the feather brush to remove all dust. It must then be, wiped with a soft linen cloth, and finally polished with buff-skin. If, there is oil or grease on any part, it must be taken off with a linen, cloth, moistened with spirits of wine, and then polished with a, buff-skin. Under no circumstances must a skin which has been wet or damp, be used, as this will scratch the lens.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All the light stuff would have been in the cabin, an' I'm allowin' that, a good bit of it will be washed up on the ledge,\\\" Captain Eph said as he, looked with a weatherly eye at the sky. \\\"We're goin' to have the wind, from the east'ard mighty soon, if signs count for anything, an' then's, when you'll get all the lumber needed for half a dozen boats, though, where it can be stored for the winter beats me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you're goin' to settle down to a spell of writin', an' I'm allowin', it won't be any small job to put the thing together ship-shape, I'll see, what can be done toward patchin' up the boy's boat,\\\" Mr. Peters said as, if making a suggestion. \\\"If we get any good weather, an' the motor is, in fair shape, it mightn't be very much of a trip to run across.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why don't you go an' fix up my bed so's we can put him in it, Sammy?, What good do you suppose it does to stand 'round here first on one foot, an' then on the other as if you was a brazen image?\\\" Captain Eph, demanded fiercely of his first assistant, and the latter ran up the, spiral stairway, hurriedly, muttering something about the folly of, treating a case such as the one in hand, before first studying the, \\\"rules and regerlations\\\" to learn whether the Board had made any, provisions for similar emergencies.\\n\\n\\\"All it needed was a clear head an' plenty of grit, Sonny,\\\" Captain Eph, added. \\\"We were stripped down to it till we had to work or freeze, an', so we kept her goin', but more'n once I made up my mind that we'd have, to turn back in spite of the hankerin' to give them poor fellows a lift., Sammy ain't overly fond of laborin', as a general thing; but I must say, he pulled away this forenoon as if he was a glutton at it, an' time an', time again it seemed as if he reg'larly lifted the dory out'er the water, with his oars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, he's lookin' 'round to see what kind of a chance he can find for, launchin' the dory! He's crazy, dead crazy! Of course I know how wild he, is at bein' obleeged to stay here idle when people are bein' drowned, before our very eyes, even though we can't see 'em, for I feel the same, way; but he an' Sammy will be only givin' up their own lives in tryin', anythin' of the kind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me and my assistants believe it is our duty, though not so laid,     down in the rules and regulations, to make a special report because,     this morning a small boy came on to the ledge in a motor boat that,     got smashed up pretty considerable on the rocks while making a,     landing, said boy claiming to be the son of Captain Harlow of the,     five-masted schooner _West Wind_ bound for Porto Rico, and he,     wishing to let his father hear that he ain't drownded. Not knowing,     how to send word to the said father that the boy is on this ledge,     safe and sound, with us feeding him out of our rations so that the,     Government won't come short of provisions, I hereby, being of sound,     mind and disposition, make report to you that the said father ought,     to be hunted up by your honorable and respected Board, so that he,     may be able to know that his son ain't yet drownded.\\n\\n\\\"We went out to look at what seemed to be a lot of wreckage; it was so, calm that the _West Wind_ hardly moved through the water, and father, said I might go with Mr. Sawyer, because I know how to run the motor and, steer. Then, before we'd got to the wreckage, the fog shut in, and we, couldn't see the schooner. I believe I could have gone straight to her, at first, but after Mr. Sawyer fell over-board, I turned the boat around, so many times trying to pick him up, that I couldn't tell where the, _West Wind_ might be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frozen? I was so cold, Sonny, that I couldn't tell you what my name, was, an' layin' there on the timbers with the wind blowin' half a gale, didn't tend to make me any warmer. After a while, though, I got to, understand that I'd die for sure if somethin' wasn't done, because I, counted help couldn't come till I'd drifted ashore, an' that mightn't be, much before mornin'. Wa'al, as I figgered it, thinkin' you folks on the, ledge couldn't come out to help me owin' to your not havin' a boat, my, only chance was to work the raft in toward the shore faster'n the wind, was carryin' her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed it isn't, Sonny, not by a long chalk. From the ledge to the, light is only one hundred an' twenty feet; but I've got up-stairs an, account of the highest tower the Board ever built, an' you shall read, it. I ain't tryin' to fill you chock-a-block with facts about, light-houses, but when you spring these 'ere questions on me I can't, help flashin' up what I know about 'em, which ain't a great deal when, you come to simmer it right down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the summer of 1772 Whiteside first made the acquaintance of the, place on which he was to indelibly engrave his name. He disembarked on, the rocks with a gang of Cornish miners, and the obstacles which they, met at the commencement of the work nearly disgusted him with the, enterprise. He and his companions had started the work when a storm, suddenly broke upon them. The wind blew with great force, and the cutter, which had brought them had to fly before the fury of the gale. The, workmen left on the rock hung on the best they could for two days and, nights. Whiteside was not discouraged, and finally brought the work to, a successful end, but not without being exposed to many dangers.\\n\\n\\\"He's right, Sonny; we're bound to set him ashore as soon as it may be, done, an' I'll write to your father myself, tellin' him what we old, shell-backs are willin' to do for the sake of keepin' on Carys' Ledge a, little shaver whom we're mighty glad to have with us. Of course you'd, rather go to him; but since he's arranged for you to stay ashore, I hope, you'll want to stop with us.\\\"\\n\\nthat we must leave the crew of Carys' Ledge and their guest, for the, very good reason that it would not be practicable to follow them day by, day to the present time. The year which Sidney was to remain there does, not come to an end until next October, and, therefore, it is impossible, to say whether he will leave the crew when his father returns, or live, so near them that daily visits may be possible.\\n\\nan' as the wheels go 'round it is raised till the whole of the flame is, uncovered, an' then lowered till it's nearly shut out. The whole thing, is simple enough, but it took a mighty clear-headed man to think it up., When a vessel comes off this coast, an' the cap'n sees Carys' Ledge, light growin' dim an' then brightenin' up, he counts the number of, seconds that go by from one bright flash to another, an' says to, himself, says he: 'That 'ere is a forty-second flash, an' she's about so, an' so off the coast.' Then he dives inter the cabin, hunts up his list, of lights, sees which one answers to the description he's got in mind\\n\\nThe Wolf Rock Light-house, off Land's End, Cornwall, England, is,     the last great British work, and both in its structure and its,     illumination it combines all the refined improvements. A survey was,     made in 1861, and the foundation commenced in March, 1862. In the,     first season only eighty-three hours of work could be done, and,     between that and its completion, on July 19, 1869; there were in,     the eight working seasons two hundred and ninety-six landings on,     the rock, and the time occupied was equal to about one hundred and,     one working days of ten hours each. The cost was L62,726.\\n\\nThe clock which regulated the flashing of the light ticked loudly; the, boom of the surf against the black reef sounded like distant thunder;, but Captain Eph heard nothing save the soft breathing of the lad after, he fell asleep, and saw nothing save the face of the \\\"little shaver\\\", against which he pressed his lips from time to time, while his eyelids, glistened in the lamp-light as if they had been wet with dew.\\n\\n\\\"There are times when it's terribly tryin' to have Sammy pokin' 'round, the kitchen; but if any trouble comes up, you can count on him every, minute of the day or night, no matter how many chances he may be takin', of losin' his own life. He an' Sonny together have run the light, done, the cookin', an' doctored Cap'n Eph and me up in great shape since we, were laid by the heels.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Right you are,\\\" Uncle Zenas added, \\\"an' I for one don't see as there is, any need of talk. We've got stuff enough to eat, an' jest so long as his, appetite sticks by him I'll give him a chance to find out what kind of a, cook I am, though it stands to reason I can't come anywhere near mixin', up what he's been in the habit of gettin' on board one of them big, schooners.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The two men who had life enough left in 'em to bear a hand, bailed the, water out while Sammy an' I pulled at the oars the best we knew how,\\\", Captain Eph continued, \\\"an' when she was lightened a bit, they got out, the second pair of oars. Of course the wind helped us mightily, when we, was homeward bound; but at the same time considerable work was needed to, fetch her in safe. That's all there was to the rescue, Sonny, an' I, reckon Sammy an' I are feelin' a good deal better than if we'd hung, 'round here listenin' to the gun without liftin' a hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because, Sonny, I wouldn't encourage sich pryin',\\\" Captain Eph replied, gravely. \\\"The man ought'er had sense enough to know that the keeper of a, first order light don't run 'round tellin' everything he knows. Perhaps, if he'd come right out an' asked who you was, I might have told him; but, when he beat about the bush, guessin' this and guessin' that, I made up, my mind he shouldn't know the least little thing about what was goin' on, at the ledge.\\\"\\n\\nAn odd-looking man was Mr. Peters (better known to his companions in the, service as \\\"Sammy\\\"), because of the fact that a bullet from the works of, Petersburg had ploughed a deep furrow across his left cheek, and carried, away a goodly portion of one ear. Thus indelibly branded as a veteran of, the Civil War, Mr. Peters had been glad to accept the position of first, assistant keeper of Carys' Ledge light, under the command of his old, comrade-in-arms, Captain Ephraim Downs.\\n\\nDescending the first flight, the keeper came to the watch room, where, was a table, a chair, a stove, and a small lamp for the comfort and, convenience of those who were on duty during the night to make certain, the lamp in the lantern (meaning the floor above), burned steadily; and, here also was a square, upright piece of mechanism known as the driving, clock, which operated the flashing light.\\n\\nIf Mr. Peters had collapsed immediately Captain Eph's needs were, supplied, Sidney would not have been surprised; in fact, he would have, looked upon it as the most natural thing possible. But the first, assistant showed no signs of weakening even now when they were absent, from the scene of the accident; he appeared to be in as good bodily, condition as ever, and the lad was so very curious regarding the, situation that he asked abruptly:\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you what it is, Sonny, we must have our motor boat in, runnin' order before next spring, for pullin' a pair of oars when a man, can jest as well sit still an' let a screw do the work is all nonsense., I've found a fellow who claims he can put your machinery in prime order, for us, an', what's more, he's comin' out here to get it, when the wind, hauls 'round to suit him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Congress prescribed, by act of September 28, 1850, that red buoys, with, even numbers, be placed on the right-hand side, and black buoys, with, odd numbers, on the left-hand side of channels approached from seaward;, that buoys placed on wrecks and other obstructions, having a channel on, each side, be painted with red and black horizontal stripes; that those, buoys placed in mid-channel, and which indicate that they must be passed, close-to to avoid danger, be painted with white and black perpendicular, stripes; and, finally, that perches, with balls, cages, etc., when, placed on buoys, will indicate a turning-point, the color and number of, the buoy showing the side on which they are to be passed.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon comin' out from the ledge has become what you might call, second nature with me, seein's how I've been knockin' about here so, long; but there ain't anything very astonishin' in findin' a shoal that, stands close by a buoy, for a man's ears ought to be as good as his, eyes. Howsomever, we're here, an' now it's our business to catch as many, fish as we can. I'll bait your hook, Sonny, an' you're to let it down, until you feel that the lead strikes bottom, then pull her up four or, five feet an' wait till you get a good, strong jerk. After that it's a, case of landin' your fish, or losin' it, cordin' to the amount of common, sense you bring into play.\\\"\\n\\nThe maritime colonies followed the example of Massachusetts, and,     when the United States by the act of August 7, 1789, accepted the,     title to, and joint jurisdiction over, the light-houses on the,     coast, and agreed to maintain them thereafter, they were eight in,     number, and comprised the following lights, all of which are still,     in existence, though so greatly improved that they are the same,     only in purpose and in site:\\n\\n\\\"We had better have this thing understood at the start, Sammy. When you, allowed that it was your business to hear whatever the keeper sent to, the inspector, it was all wrong, because if I want to make a report, privately, it ain't any concern of my assistants; but in this 'ere case, I have made you an' Uncle Zenas a part of the doc'ment, so to speak, an', that's why I'm explainin' matters.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Keepers are forbidden to engage in any business which can interfere, with their presence at their stations, or with the proper and timely, performance of their light-house duties; but it is no unusual thing to, find a keeper working at his station as a shoemaker, tailor, or in some, similar capacity, and there are light keepers who fill a neighboring, pulpit, who hold commissions as justice of the peace, and there are, still others who do duty as school teachers without neglecting their, light-houses.\\n\\nThere was an expression of deepest anxiety on Captain Eph's face as he, ascended the iron stairs, and on arriving at the floor above he stood, for a moment gazing at the childish face which could be seen amid the, mountain of bed-clothing, for in his desire to do all that might be, possible for the little fellow, Mr. Peters had piled upon the bed every, blanket and comfortable to be found in the tower.\\n\\n\\\"If you look back a page or two, Sonny, you'll find that the one burned, was built wholly of timber on the outside, and so was the top part of, the inside. This tower couldn't burn flat, bein' all stone, but the, rooms would have been pretty well cleaned out if you an' Sammy hadn't, worked mighty lively. We came off a good deal better than those poor, fellows did, an' Uncle Zenas can thank his lucky stars that it was, melted fat instead of lead which fell on him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As the fishing-boat could do nothing to quell the flames, it returned, to Plymouth to land the keepers; one, as soon as he got on shore, ran, away, it is supposed in a panic; the one burned by the melted lead was, sent to his own home for medical attendance; he was ninety-four years, old, but remarkably active considering his age. He told the doctor that, he had swallowed the molten lead, and that he could not be cured unless, it was removed. He lived until the twelfth day, when he suddenly, expired--the doctor opened his stomach, and found therein a solid oval, piece of lead weighing more than seven ounces.\\\"\\n\\nDown another flight, and the keeper was in a third circular room, where, were two beds. Another flight brought him to his own apartment, and, below that the kitchen, over which Uncle Zenas presided as cook and, second assistant light keeper, where everything was wondrously neat and, clean, and where every inch of space was economized for the better, keeping of the food, cooking utensils, and such articles as are, ordinarily found in similar apartments on shore.\\n\\n\\\"Early in the day, as the tide rose, the sea made a complete breach over, the rock, washing every movable thing away, and of the old dwelling not, one stone was left upon another. The new dwelling was flooded, and the, windows had to be secured to prevent the violence of the spray from, breaking them in. As the tide came, the sea rose higher and higher, till, the only endurable places were the light-towers. If they stood we were, saved, otherwise our fate was only too certain. But for some reason, I, know not why, I had no misgivings, and went on with my work as usual., For four weeks, owing to rough weather, no landing could be effected on, this rock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thought I'd gone crazy, eh?\\\" he cried as soon as it was possible for, him to speak. \\\"You an' Uncle Zenas have been figgerin' how you could get, me into the hospital, I s'pose? Crazy!\\\" and again the first assistant, laughed until he choked and gasped for breath. \\\"Let me tell you, Cap'n, Eph, that when I do go off the hooks you won't see me loafin' 'round, peaceable as this, for I'll think I'm in front of Petersburg again, an', cut up in a way that you can't call pleasant.\\\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later the keeper and his assistants were busily engaged on, their respective tasks. Captain Eph sat in the watch-room laboring over, his report; Uncle Zenas was cooking as if his very life depended upon, getting the largest amount of provisions prepared for eating in the, shortest possible space of time, and on the rocks Mr. Peters was, measuring and figuring on the shattered boat, confident that he could, soon put her in a seaworthy condition, provided he should be able to, find the proper material.\\n\\n\\\"The purpose of a light-ship is to do the work of a light-house in a, place where one is necessary, but where it has not been erected because, of the great difficulty, not to say expense, of such a structure. To, insure permanency of position is a matter of great difficulty. When, moorings have been made too heavy to drag, chains have broken; when they, have held, mooring-bitts have been torn out; when they have held, the, ship has foundered at her anchors, or the cable has been slipped, and, the ship has sought a harbor or gone to sea for safety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not? When a man comes as far as he has while a storm seems to be, brewin', it would kind'er be hard lines to hold him because Sammy was, off wreckin'. We'll load on the motor as soon as it can be done, an', send him back while the weather is decent, else he might be on our hands, quite a spell. People can't get out here at this time of year jest when, the fancy strikes 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It must be, Sonny, else he wouldn't act so kind of queer. All Cap'n Eph, an' I can figger out is that he got squeezed in some way between the, timbers of the raft, for it stands to reason he didn't put 'em together, very carefully. Oh Sonny, Sonny, if only I hadn't refused to give the, poor fellow his breakfast when he asked for it! Somehow I felt last, night as if it wasn't right for him to go off to the wreck alone, an', when he came down-stairs this mornin' reg'larly achin' to be off, I lost, my temper, an' that's the fact. The worst part of this world is that, after you say or do anythin' that's wrong or mean, you can't take it, back agin! Jest as likely as not he'd be in better shape now, if he'd, had a full stomach when he went away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I just sat there and cried, sir, till I remembered what father has, often told me, that when a boy, or a man, for that matter, loses his, courage, he is a great deal worse off than if he kept up his spirits. I, had often run the motor while the _West Wind_ was in port, and I tried, to make out how much gasolene there was in the tank, for I knew, steerage-way was needed, else I couldn't keep her head up into the wind., It was a terribly long while before day came again, and then the fog, covered everything so that I couldn't see very far in either direction., Of course father hunted for me; but I knew he didn't have much chance of, finding me in that kind of weather.\\\"\\n\\nAs Captain Eph had predicted, the storm subsided during the night, and, before breakfast had been eaten the clouds were being driven eastward by, the wind. The sea yet ran so high that the ledge was covered by the, waves a goodly portion of the time; but all the crew were positive that, within the next four and twenty hours it would be possible to make the, trip to the mainland in the dory, even though she carried the four, shipwrecked ones in addition to two of the keepers.\\n\\nThe first assistant led the way up through the one street of the, settlement as if he believed the new uniform he wore would cause a great, deal of excitement, and he was, in fact, the center of attraction while, he remained on shore, for even the children of the village had heard of, the three old cronies who kept the light on Carys' Ledge, holding to, their duties so closely as to visit the mainland no oftener than once in, two or three years.\\n\\n\\\"You can have anything I've got, Uncle Zenas, if it's to be used for, that lad. I don't understand why it is; but the little shaver has got, inter my heart mighty deep, even though he's only been here since, daylight,\\\" and the keeper gazed out into the fog as if he saw there a, picture of a \\\"little shaver\\\" who called him \\\"father\\\" many, many years, ago, but who now, with his mother, awaited the old man on the shores of, that golden river which neither pain, nor sorrow, nor sin can cross.\\n\\n\\\"In May the top of the rock was leveled and a foundation made about 88, feet above the sea, and, on the 31st, three masons, four derricks, a, small engine, and the appliances for laying the masonry, were landed., The stone, a fine grained, compact basalt, quarried near Portland and, cut to dimensions by contract, was delivered at Astoria and shipped to, the rock on the tender. The first cargo was landed on June 17; on the, 22nd the corner-stone was laid, and then the rest of the material was, shipped to the rock as the weather permitted.\\n\\n\\\"Captain Nutter of the _Nautilus_ reported to the Department, through, me, that you two men, at great peril to yourselves, saved the lives of, three of his crew and himself, all of whom would have unquestionably, been drowned but for your heroic exertions. The Light-House Board has, instructed me to say that they are proud to have such men in the, service, and I have here a letter of commendation. The Treasury, Department has sent these two gold medals on which are inscribed your, names and the service rendered, in token that the Government holds you, in especial esteem as brave men--such men as are needed in the, light-house service.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I started, Sonny, but hadn't got very far before I saw that I was, likely to lose some of my load unless it was looked after, so I ran the, bow of the dory up on the lumber, an' got out to make the heaviest, timbers fast. I reckon that in movin' 'round I tilted the side of the, raft down so the boat slipped off; but she was twenty yards away before, I knew what had happened. Of course I didn't suppose that the man would, come after the motor so soon, an' allowed that my only chance of ever, seein' Carys' Ledge agin was to catch the dory.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I'll eat the fish when they are caught,\\\" Mr. Peters exclaimed, indignantly. \\\"Do you suppose I'm that wasteful to let fresh cod spoil? I, haven't got anything agin folks goin' fishin', only when you come to, thinkin' that as soon as a storm springs up we'll be shut off from, workin' on the motor boat, it seems a good deal like wastin' time, since, we ain't really dyin' for need of that kind of food.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An' I called myself all kinds of an old villain for declarin' you, shouldn't have any breakfast, Sammy,\\\" Uncle Zenas said, his voice, tremulous with pain. \\\"I hope you won't lay it up agin me, for we've been, in danger too often to let anything come between us, an' when I get, so's I can stand on my feet, you may kick me all 'round this ledge at, low water.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't reckon you'd do yourself very proud by tryin' anything of the, kind, Sonny. In this 'ere smother it's a case of goin' by ear, an' I'll, pull up to the sound of the whistle, so make yourself comfortable in the, stern-sheets. The line you see there I laid out for you, an' it wouldn't, be a bad idee, if you want to be at work on somethin', to overhaul it., The bait is in this 'ere can amidships.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The iron ice-buoy is made of boiler-iron, and is divided into, compartments, so that any one may be pierced without sinking the buoy., One of the first-class costs $275, is fifty feet long, and stands, twenty-two feet out of water. One of the second-class costs $181, is, forty feet long, and stands seventeen feet out of water. As with wooden, spar-buoys, the ice passes over them without carrying them away; but\\n\\n\\\"Because I was so all-fired mean, Sonny, that is the reason. I saw that, Uncle Zenas was worryin' a good deal about me, an' made up my mind to, give him a good dose, so the next time I wanted to start away early he, wouldn't dare to say I shouldn't have breakfast till it was ready for, all hands. I fixed it with myself that I'd get up sometime this mornin'\\n\\n\\\"Well, go ahead. I reckon there ain't any such terrible great rush on, this 'ere boat, an' besides, as first assistant of the light, it's my, business to know what kind of a tale the keeper is sendin' to the, inspector,\\\" and Mr. Peters seated himself on the sharp edge of a rock in, token that he was prepared to listen; but Captain Eph said gravely, before beginning to read:\\n\\n\\\"Now don't get anythin' like that inter your head, Sonny, although I, allow there's reason for it. When I first came to Carys' Ledge, an' was, standin' watch on a night like this, it seemed certain the tower would, go by the board; but after a time I made myself understand that it was, almost as firm as the solid rock. Besides, not bein' so big as to offer, much resistance to the gale, I question if even a full-sized tornado, could harm it.\\\"\\n\\nWhen a lad is eager to be of assistance to those around him, there is, always ample opportunity, and during the remainder of this day Sidney, found something with which to occupy his time. More than once was he, able to render valuable service in the work of repairing the boat; Uncle, Zenas declared that the lad had \\\"helped him out wonderfully,\\\" and, Captain Eph discovered that the visitor's penmanship was very much more, legible than his own, therefore the \\\"report\\\" to the Board relative to, the coming of a boat belonging to the schooner _West Wind_ was copied, neatly, with much advantage, so far as the general appearance of the, document was concerned.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon it would take a mighty smart man to say that there'd been any, smoke in this 'ere lantern, an' now we'd better go down to see what the, poor fellows are needin'. I don't expect, Sonny, that you'll ever think, of me as anything except the meanest critter that ever walked the face, of the earth; but I'm askin' that you won't show it before the others., Life wouldn't be worth the livin', if they should know what I'd done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Early in the morning the fire was seen on shore, and a philanthropic, gentleman fitted out a fishing boat which arrived at the light-house at, 10 A.M. The fire had then been burning eight hours; the light keepers, had been driven from the tower, and, to avoid the falling timbers and, red-hot bolts, had taken refuge in the hole or cave on the east side of, the rocks under the iron ladder, near the landing.\\n\\n\\\"Keepers are trained to consider the care of the light and the, light-house property their paramount duty, beyond any personal, consideration; and the _esprit de corps_ is such that instances have, happened where the keepers on duty have, as in the case of the first, light on Minot's Ledge, gone down with their light-house and died at, their post; others, where the keeper has saved his lens, letting his, family shift for themselves; and there are repeated instances where the, keeper has saved his light-house property and lost his own.\\n\\n\\\"'In addition to this, the keepers had attached a five-and-a-half inch, hawser to the lantern deck, and anchored the other end to a granite, block, weighing, according to their account, seven tons, placed upon the, bottom at a distance of some fifty fathoms from the base of the tower., The object of this was to provide means for running a box or, landing-chair up and down; but it is very clear that so much surface, exposed to the moving sea had the same effect upon the light-house as, would have been produced by a number of men pulling at a rope attached, to the highest part of the structure, with the design of pulling it, down.\\n\\n\\\"See here, Sammy, there are times when you try a patient man like me, as, nobody has been tried since the days of Job. Of course I ain't tryin' to, keep any baby away from his own true an' lawful father, an' I called you, up here so's we could decide how to get word to the capt'n of the _West, Wind_ that his boy is here as safe an' snug as a bug in a rug.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Sonny, an' for two mighty good reasons. The first is that it's, goin' to blow hard inside of an hour, an' I'll need Uncle Zenas at one, pair of oars. Then agin, the place is not to be left alone, no matter, what straits we are in. Sammy would be the first to say we mustn't try, to help him if it can't be done without takin' the risk of showin' no, light at sunset. You'll be safe on the ledge, an' that's what I'm, thinkin' about.\\\"\\n\\nHe, with one of the men from the fisherman, had been sent out to set, trawls, and while they were thus engaged a white squall struck them. To, make any effort at battling against it was out of the question, and they, allowed their boat to drift before it, doing no more than to keep her, head on to the seas, believing the fishing schooner would be able to, pick them up.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon it wouldn't hurt very much if we broke the regerlations a, little bit, when perhaps there are lives to be saved,\\\" Mr. Peters, muttered as the keeper, raising the trap-door carefully, descended the, narrow, winding staircase, but the first assistant made no attempt to, follow his superior officer, because of knowing full well, from past, experience, that any such disobedience of orders would be followed by a, reprimand not pleasant to receive.\\n\\n\\\"Ay Sonny, sixteen of 'em either froze or went under before we got, there, an' two of these couldn't have lasted another half hour; but we, won't talk about that jest now. From the time Sammy an' me started, I, kept sayin' to myself that when we got back I'd take you in my arms, as, I've got you near an' hold you jest as long as you could stand it, for, you're gettin' to be a good part of my life, laddie.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On one such day this cataract carried away the supply-house, and even, endangered the quarters of the working party. For more than two weeks at, this time it was impossible for the steam-tender which supplied their, wants to cross the bar at the mouth of the Columbia River to go to their, assistance; when, after sixteen days, communication was reopened, the, party was found to be safe, but much in want of fresh provisions. These, were supplied by an endless line running between the mast of the, supply-vessel and a ring-bolt driven into the top of the rock, in, water-tight casks suspended from a traveler by slings, which was made to, move along the line.\\n\\nWhen the clock in the kitchen struck the hour of four, it was as if his, heart ceased beating, for he understood that even if the dory should, come in sight immediately, it would be impossible for the keepers to, reach the ledge before sunset, and he felt positive they would never, return. He would be the sole occupant of that lonely tower until the, inspector found an opportunity of visiting Carys' Ledge.\\n\\n\\\"You'll reach me then, Uncle Zenas, so long as you have your tongue, left,\\\" Captain Eph replied with a hearty laugh at his own wit as he went, hurriedly out of the tower, beckoning Sidney to follow. Not until the, lad had put on the coat made from the keeper's uniform would the cook, allow him to leave the kitchen, and by the time he gained the head of, the little cove, Mr. Peters had the dory ready for the voyage.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Sonny. She'd struck the shoal jest as I allowed, an' had driven up, on the rocks till the fo'c'sle deck was well out'er water, else never, one of the crew would have lived to talk about it. She was a big, barkentine--nigh to a thousand tons, I should say--breakin' up mighty, fast when we got there, with only four men left on deck, an' they so, covered with ice an' snow that you wouldn't have taken 'em for human, beings. They had a small gun, sich as is used for signalin', lashed to, the capstan; but were past firin' it when we hove in sight.\\\"\\n\\nAnd as the crew of the light-house thus discussed the possibility that, the signals of distress might have a terrible meaning for the lad whom, they had learned to love so well, the new day came slowly, revealing a, wind-lashed sea which rolled angrily over the ledge as if striving to, compass the destruction of the tower, while a dense veil of fleecy, particles, blown into wreaths and clouds by the gale, enveloped the, light-house as by a fog.\\n\\n\\\"Spar-buoys frequently lose a portion of their length, which is cut off, by strokes of colliding propeller-blades. Despite state and national, statutes forbidding it, vessels will sometimes make fast to buoys, thus, gradually dragging them off their bearings. A buoy has sometimes been, set adrift that a reward might be obtained for its recovery; but this is, not a profitable operation, as the reward paid is varied with the, circumstances of each case.\\n\\n\\\"If you'll go into my room an' get a book called _Ancient an' Modern, Light-Houses_, which was written by Major Heap of the Army, I'll show, you a story about the burnin' of the second Eddystone light--you, remember that the first was carried away by the sea,\\\" the keeper, replied, and believing it might cause the invalids to forget in some, slight degree their sad condition, Sidney went hurriedly for the book in, question, reading aloud, after Captain Eph had found the story, that, which is set down here:\\n\\nas him. An' the same holds good in my case. I wouldn't put my foot down, on the floor, to step any part of my weight on it, for the best hundred, dollars I ever heard tell about, an' you two couldn't carry me half-way, to my room. I've been thinkin' it all out, an' can't see any other, course than for Uncle Zenas an' me to stay where we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The buoy service has its own code of laws, State and national, a fleet, of small steamers for its maintenance, and a corps of contractors to, attend to the buoyage of coves and inlets impracticable to the steamers., It has its depots for the storage of iron buoys, where they are painted, and numbered, or repaired, and also where wooden buoys are made ready, for service. It has its own directory printed yearly, in thirteen, volumes, distributed gratuitously for the benefit of commerce, in which, each one is mentioned by name, located by station, and described by, size, color, number, and vicinity.\\n\\n\\\"It must be he's makin' for the ledge, an' it stands to reason we, ought'er lend him a hand. There, that's the last we'll see of the craft, unless some mighty fine steerin' is done, an' since it's no use lookin', out in the fog, Sammy, you'd better get to work on the lamp, while I go, down in case he's got brains enough to hold his course. Remember, that, 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations, the work of gettin' things, ship-shape must be begun immediately the light is put out, and we've, loafed too long already.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be in too big a hurry to pull me out, an' I'll get mighty near to, those fellows, if so be the dory strikes anywhere near where we're, expectin',\\\" Mr. Peters said as he came toward the window. \\\"We won't be, havin' any too much time, if I start now,\\\" and he stepped out of the, window, clutching the sill until the two at the rope were ready to lower, him away.\\n\\n\\\"Because I spoke the _West Wind_ two days ago. She had been cruising, around in search of the missing boat, and was only just put on her, course again when I met her. Captain Harlow asked me to have the fact of, the lad's being adrift in a motor boat inserted in all the leading, newspapers, offering a reward to any one who could give information, concerning the boy. He is bound for San Juan, and thence to Cadiz.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If they wasn't we shouldn't have sich lights in this country as we have, got. I ain't claimin' that we're the only nation on the face of the, earth who knows how to light a coast; but I will say, an' I've heard the, same from masters of foreign vessels, that we do the thing up brown, regardless of expense. Listen to rule 127, an' than I reckon it'll be, time to turn off the light: 'To clean reflectors, first dust them and, then rub with a buff-skin, lightly dusted with rouge powder, kept in a, small double bag of muslin; then rub lightly with another skin, and, finally with a third, which should be passed over the reflector in a, light, quick manner with a circular motion. Leakage of gas from the pipe, of the stove used in the watch-room should be carefully guarded against\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to fetch an' carry for this whole blessed crew, an' that at a, time when the fish-cakes are like to be burned to a cinder, I'll send in, a petition to the Board to have this 'ere stairway stretched till an, ordinary man can get through without scrapin' the skin all off his, shoulders,\\\" he said angrily, and Captain Eph replied, as he took the, glasses from the huge hand which was extended toward him:\\n\\n\\\"It was because of you that we tried to land here the other day; your, father had requested that you be taken from the ledge, and a, boarding-place be found for you on the mainland. Since having received, your letter, however, he telegraphed, yesterday, that you be allowed to, remain in the light until his return, and because of the assistance, which I learn you have rendered the keepers, I see no reason why the, Board will not grant his request.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When we found Sammy it looked to me as if he was pretty far gone; but, yet I took note of everything to be seen, with the hope of gettin' an, idee as to how the trouble came about. The top part of the raft was made, of heavy timbers, which appeared as if they'd been thrown there the last, thing because he'd seen that it would be jest as easy to take 'em along\\n\\n\\\"I ain't so certain 'bout that, though I'll admit that a man couldn't, keep his footin' there, an' 'tend to much of anything else; but the tide, is ebbin' now, an' it'll be within an hour of low water by the time that, 'ere dory gets here. I'm thinkin' you'll be able to see quite a bit of, Carys' Ledge by that time. Has Cap'n Eph made out anything new?\\\"\\n\\nThe great distinction between the later towers and their,     predecessors is that the stones of each course are dovetailed,     together laterally and vertically, so that the use of metal or,     wooden pins is needless. This method was first used at the Hanois,     Rock, Guernsey. On the upper face and at one end of each block is a,     dovetailed projection; and on the under face and at the other end,     is a dovetailed indentation. The upper and under dovetails are made,     just to fall into each other, and when the hydraulic cement is,     placed on the surface it so locks the dovetailing that the stones,     cannot be separated without breaking. Thus, when the cement is set,     and hardened, the whole of the base is literally one solid mass of,     granite. The lower courses for the first 39 feet of the Wolf Rock,     Light-house have fillets on their outer edges, into which the,     upper course is stepped, and this prevents the action of the waves,     from penetrating the joint.\\n\\n\\\"I'm goin' to tell you the whole story, Sonny, an' it shall be a secret, 'twixt you an' me. In the first place I was chafin' under the collar a, good bit when I left here to go to the wreck, after Uncle Zenas had, declared I shouldn't have a bite to eat till breakfast was ready. It, didn't seem jest the thing for him to make me go hungry because he was, set against my savin' what I could from the _Nautilus_, an' I'll leave, it to you if I wasn't right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We couldn't do the job without callin' all hands, an' I don't feel as, if I'd be doin' right to take any chances jest to save property. The sea, is breakin' over the ledge already, an' the rocks remainin' out of water, must be covered with snow an' ice. Go back to bed, Sammy, for, as you, know full well, we've got no right to stick our noses outside this, night. After daybreak, if she's still sound, we may be able to work, somethin' for her safety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Still increasing, it required but a slight increase in the height of, the waves, after having reached the deck, to bring it in contact with, the main body of the structure. When this took place it is plain to, perceive that such a sea, acting upon the surface of the building at the, end of a lever fifty or sixty feet long, must be well nigh, irresistible, and I doubt not that the light-house was thus destroyed.'\\n\\n\\\"Don't say a word, Sonny, or my courage won't hold out to tell the whole, of the story. Until about midnight I wasn't more'n half sensible of what, was goin' on; but after then I could have got up an' gone to work jest, as well as I can now, though I felt a bit lazy, an' considerable tired., I was jest mean enough to lay there in bed an' let you three stay on, watch all night, when there was nothin' to prevent my doin' a full share, of the duty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't count on bein' able to give you the idee as to the work of the, lenses sich as a man ought'er; but I'll try my best, an' if I fail you, won't be any worse off than you are now. In the first place this 'ere is, what is known as a light of the first order, meanin' the most powerful, in the service, an' the lens alone cost about eight thousand dollars., The middle part of the lens is made up of what's known as 'refractors,', which, 'cordin' to my way of tellin' it, are rings of glass makin' a, hollow cylinder six feet in diameter, an' thirty inches high. Below it\\n\\n\\\"I must be losin' my mind, to even imagine sich a thing!\\\" he exclaimed, petulantly, dashing the moisture from his eyes as if by so doing it, might be possible to penetrate the dense veil of vapor which shut out, from view even the tower of the light. \\\"It's a crazy trick for a grown, man to be whifflin' 'round here in this smother, without my thinkin' I, heard a boy. Hello-o-o-o!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wa'al, Sonny, I allow it ain't overly cheerful talk on a night like, this; but so long as it's in your mind I don't s'pose it'll make matters, seem worse if we go over the story. Nobody knows jest what time, on the, night of April 16th, the tower was carried away; but it's reasonable to, allow it was done about high water, which was an hour after midnight. It, was built on iron piles set into the rock, instead of bein' a solid, tower sich as are put up nowadays. I've heard them as should know, say, that keepers weren't held up to the rules an' regerlations as strict as, they are now, an' them as were in charge of Minot's Ledge Light had, built a platform well down below the livin' rooms, where they could stow, anything which it might not be convenient to keep inside. Here's what, the Government engineer, who was sent to look after the matter, said, about it,\\\" and Captain Eph, opening a book which lay near him, read the, following:\\n\\n\\\"Sonny,\\\" he cried, \\\"run up-stairs an' strip all the beds; bring the, clothes here, an' then help me rub these poor creeters down. Ephraim, Downs, you an' Sammy Peters are to get out of them wet duds jest as, quick as you know how, an' don't you dare let me see you liftin' a, finger till you're in dry clothes. I've had trouble enough about you, this day, without your gettin' all drawed up with rheumatiz jest for, spite. You're enough to wear a man down to skin an' bones, an' I've come, to that pass where I can't stand any more of your capers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've studied the rules an' regerlations ever since I was so, misfortunate as to be appointed second assistant keeper of this 'ere, light, an' so far I haven't found anything laid down agin answerin' the, keeper back when he tries to ride over a man. I allow you're in command, of the lantern, Captain Eph; but I've got some rights all to myself here, in the kitchen, an' there's goin' to be trouble if them as belong, up-stairs interfere while I'm 'tendin' to my reg'lar duties.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I had, I'd pull this 'ere dory all the way to the mainland for the, sake of reportin' 'em as a crew of lunatics what ought'er be locked, up before they drown themselves! It was some pleasure craft, manned by a, lot of idjuts who most likely think they are sailormen because of once, havin' sailed a toy boat in a wash-tub,\\\" and Captain Eph took up the, oars again. \\\"I reckon we'll let that put an end to our fishin' for this, day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The buoy's worst enemy, however, is ice, when moving in mass, and with, a tide or current. A well-made, well-moored buoy at the mouth of a, narrow river can create an ice-gorge; but usually, when the ice moves in, force, the buoys met have their mooring-loops torn out, their, mooring-chains broken, or their mooring-anchors weighed; and in each, case the buoys are carried out to sea, when the buoy tenders give chase\\n\\nBy this time Uncle Zenas had arrived at the scene, and, thanks to his, assistance, the little craft with her crew of one was pulled so far in, toward the rocks that the keeper and the cook had no difficulty in, running her bow on the ways, after which, as Mr. Peters scrambled out of, the water looking like a very large, half-drowned cat, the boy was taken, from the boat by Captain Eph.\\n\\n\\\"'Sir,--Finding ourselves at this moment in the most critical,    and dangerous condition, we hope that Providence will guide this,    letter to you, and that you will immediately come to our succor.,    Send to seek for us before spring, or we will perish, I fear;,    our supply of wood and water is almost exhausted, and our house,    is in the most sad state. We do not doubt that you would come to,    seek us as promptly as possible. We can be reached at high tide,    in almost any weather. I have no need to tell you more, you will,    comprehend our distress, and I remain\\n\\nAll hands stood watch during the night. Sidney felt positive he could, not close his eyes in slumber if he went to bed, and Captain Eph did not, urge him, understanding full well how the lad felt. Uncle Zenas claimed, that it was his right, because of what had happened in the morning, to, sit by the side of Mr. Peters, even though it might not be possible to, do him any good, and thus it was that the crew remained on duty, throughout the hours of darkness.\\n\\n\\\"Why should we? Ain't three of us enough for company? When all hands get, to loafin' 'round the kitchen I think it's reg'larly crowded. The fact, of the matter is, Sonny, we don't really have time for anything of that, kind. What with keepin' the place cleaned 'cordin' to the rules an', regerlations, an' doin' the odd chores, about all the time is so took up, we couldn't be lonesome if we wanted to; but we don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I allow it can be done without turnin' a hair. I'm predictin' a fair, day for to-morrow; but with a heavy sea runnin'. Four an' twenty hours, later it should be possible for Sammy an' me to make the mainland in the, dory. It'll take the best part of to-morrow for me to write out another, report as to the wreck, an' a letter to your father, so we'll be gettin', off about as soon as all hands are ready.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what we don't jest know, Sonny. We overtook the raft ten miles, or more from here, an' poor little Sammy was stretched out at full, length on it as if he was dead, with the waves washin' clean over him, every now an' then. It didn't take us long to find that there was some, little life left in his body, an' you can make up your mind that we, jumped it to the dory after takin' him aboard, for the only hope of, fetchin' him around was to get back here. Uncle Zenas an' I were feelin', mighty glum, as you can well guess; but there was a big lot of gladness, come inter our hearts when we saw the light streamin' out from Carys', Ledge, an' knew that the little shaver we'd left behind was bucklin', right down to duty.\\\"\\n\\nan' says to himself, says he: 'That's Carys' Ledge, an' I'll make the, course a leetle more southerly.' If that 'ere clock should happen to, break down on account of not bein' properly cared for, we'd have to take, turns grindin' a crank to keep the brass cylinder movin' up an' down, 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations, else there'd soon be another, ship piled up on the rocks alongside the _Nautilus_.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not so certain of that,\\\" Mr. Peters said as he examined the motor, carefully. \\\"Of course neither you nor me could set it up, because we, don't know how; but if it holds good weather I'm goin' to take it, ashore, an' put it in the hands of some man who understands his, business. If it's possible to get it in shape, I'll buy a hull, an' next, spring we can knock around out here like a couple of swells, with our, own yacht.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Number 125 is longer; but it ain't hard to catch the general idee of, it. 'When the light is extinguished in the morning the keeper must hang, the lantern curtains and immediately begin to put the apparatus in order, for relighting. While doing this the linen aprons provided for the, keeper's use must be worn, that the lens may not suffer from contact, with the wearing apparel. The illuminating apparatus must be carefully, covered before the cleaning is begun.' Now here's Sammy's apron for you\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, they managed to chisel out a kind of a hole at one side where, they could bolt some timbers to the solid foundation, an' cover them, with canvas. That was enough to give 'em a place to crawl into when the, sea ran too high; but look you, lad; I ain't certain that I'm tellin', this story straight, so supposin' we go back to the watch-room, an' I'll, give it to you set down in print, the same as I read it, then there, won't be any mistake.\\\"\\n\\nwhile he, with more brains in his little finger than the whole of us can, muster, comes up an' tells the facts. Of course that was why the tender, came out here, an' we'll see her again before many days. Sammy, I'm, goin' to make a try at gettin' up-stairs, so's there will be one bed, less in this kitchen, an' we'll see if things can't be pulled 'round as, they ought'er be 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations.\\\"\\n\\nIn a twinkling the room was a scene of the greatest excitement. Captain, Eph, forgetting his injured limb, attempted to spring to his feet, but, sank back quickly with a groan, and Uncle Zenas, thinking only that the, inspector might not be pleased at seeing beds in the kitchen, bent over, to gather up the clothing, when the partially healed burns caused him to, straighten up again as a cry of pain escaped his lips.\\n\\n\\\"Now don't fret over that a little bit, Cap'n Eph,\\\" Mr. Peters cried, imploringly. \\\"It wouldn't hurt me any if I stood watch every night till, you an' Uncle Zenas got 'round agin; but Sonny has shown that he can, look after the light as well as either of us, an' he an' I will run, things slick as grease. He can go on watch till midnight, an' I'll take, the rest of the time, doin' all the cleanin' alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now I reckon we'll go inter the lantern,\\\" Uncle Zenas said when it was, no longer possible to distinguish the faces of those in the boat, owing, to the dim light. \\\"Cap'n Eph will keep his eyes on the light, an' if it, shouldn't happen to die away at the very minute when the sun ought'er, rise 'cordin' to his watch, the chances are he'd make all hands come, back to straighten us out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, look here, Cap'n Eph, there ain't any call for you to get up so, high on your ear,\\\" Mr. Peters interrupted. \\\"I wasn't allowin' it could, be anything but the truth, an' only spoke that way because there didn't, seem to be much else to say. We've got him here, an' are bound to take, care of him, no matter what the rules an' regerlations say about, boardin' or lodgin' houses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The men were stupefied, and the wind being from the east made a landing, extremely hazardous, if not impracticable. They, however, were saved by, the crew first anchoring the large boat, then a small boat was rowed, toward the rock, paying out a rope which was attached to the large boat;, when near enough to the rock a heaving-line was thrown to the men. Each, light keeper in turn fastened the rope around his waist, and, jumping, into the sea, was hauled into the boat.\\n\\nSidney was not particularly elated by the promise, since he believed the, motor was injured beyond repair; but Mr. Peters was so confident that, he talked of little else during the remainder of the day, and before, sunset even Uncle Zenas had begun to speculate upon the possibility of, owning a power boat, which might be housed on the mainland during the, winter season, when she could not be kept on the ledge.\\n\\nand the family ran short of food. Waiting until famine stared them in, the face, the son started in a little skiff equipped with a sail, made, by the aid of his sister, to obtain succor. Pushing from the rock in his, frail craft, he was at first lost sight of in the trough of the sea; he, reappeared on the top of the waves for a short distance, and was seen no, more for twenty-one days, during which time the mother and the four, girls were reduced to a cup of corn-meal and one egg each per day. Added, to risk of perishing of famine in mid-ocean, was the torturing suspense, as to the fate of father and son.\\n\\nSave for two rows of timbers securely bolted to the rocks, and extending, from the base of the tower to the water's edge to form \\\"ways,\\\" on which, a boat could be drawn up or launched, and a small hut not unlike the, dwelling of an Esquimau, made of cement, and large enough to shelter a, dory, there was nothing to be seen on the ledge of jagged rocks, over, which one could make his way only with considerable difficulty.\\n\\n\\\"Bless your heart, yes, Sonny. Many a vessel went ashore here before the, tower was built, an' we've had a wreck close at hand twice since, though, neither of the craft struck this ledge. If the weather is changin', as, Sammy says, it ain't very pleasant to be talkin' 'bout what's likely to, happen whenever the light can't be seen. Ain't it time for you to show, up your surprise, Sammy?\\\"\\n\\nThe theory of coast lighting is that each coast shall be so set,     with towers that the rays from their lights shall meet and pass,     each other, so that a vessel on the coast shall never be out of,     sight of a light, and that there shall be no dark places between,     lights. This is the theory upon which the United States is,     proceeding, and it plants lights where they are most needed upon,     those lines. Hence from year to year the length of the dark spaces,     on its coasts is lessened or expunged entirely, and the day will,     come when all its coasts will be defined from end to end by a band,     of lights by night, and by well-marked beacons by day.\\n\\n\\\"Wa'al, I can't say as to that, Sammy, seein's how we haven't had a, chance to send the letter ashore yet, and even if that was done, I, couldn't figure to any certainty on how long it would take to carry it, to Porto Rico. Of course I ought to know all about that, seein's I've, fished on the Banks, man and boy, for pretty nigh half my life; but yet, I don't. Somehow I'm afraid I ain't up in geography as I ought'er be., Any way, the first part of the work is done, meanin' the makin' of the, report, and now it stands us in hand to keep a bright lookout for a, craft that can be hailed.\\\"\\n\\nthe furious sea always prevented a landing. One of them returned one day, with a strange report. Its crew had seen a man, standing motionless, in, a corner of the exterior gallery. Near him floated a signal of distress., But was he dead or alive? No one could say. Each evening anxious looks, were cast at the light-house to see if its light would be shown, and, each evening it shone brightly, proof that some one was still there. But, were both keepers alive, and if there were but one who was the survivor?, This was learned later.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon, after thinkin' of all that, there ain't any one of this 'ere, crew as feels like complainin', eh?\\\" and Captain Eph looked around, sternly, much as though believing his assistants were on the verge of, insubordination. \\\"If a seventeen-year-old girl, with the same as, nothin' to eat, can take care of a whole family an' a light for, twenty-one days durin' heavy weather, we deserve to be kicked if there's, any show of gettin' down at the heel.\\\"\\n\\nand when so far distant from market as to make its carriage equal or, exceed its cost, with fuel and rations. Suitable boats are furnished, stations inaccessible by land; and at those stations on shore, distant, from markets, barns are built for their cattle and horses. Something, also has been done for the intellectual needs of the keepers and their, families by supplying them with libraries. These are arranged in cases, so constructed that they make rather a neat appearance when set upright, on a table, and they need only to be closed and locked to be ready for, transportation. They contain on an average about fifty volumes each. One, of these libraries is left at a station for some three months, when it, is exchanged and passed on to another station. This is usually done when, the inspector makes his quarterly inspection; so each of the stations to, which libraries are furnished sees some two hundred different books each, year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, Sonny, is the hard part of explainin' the business, because I, don't know so much about it as I ought'er; but I've heard the inspector, talk somethin' like this: The flame of the lamp sends its rays in all, directions--up, down, an' sideways; an' what's wanted is to get the, light streamin' out in a straight line all around, so the top an' bottom, of this 'ere glass cage is put on to bend the rays till they go in the, same direction as those in the middle of the flame. 'Cordin' to the, inspector, when a ray of light strikes a prism of glass, it turns toward, the base, as you'll see in this--wa'al, I don't hardly know what to call, it--that I've been drawin' so's you'll understand what the inspector, means by bendin' the rays. You'll notice that, except in the middle, the, prisms are each set at a different angle, an' with a space between 'em\\n\\n\\\"Bless your soul, Sonny, you'd be of use if you didn't do more than let, us old shell-backs look at you,\\\" and Captain Eph seated himself in the, chair, rocking the lad as if he had been a baby. \\\"You never can know how, much good it has done us to have you here. If it wasn't for the sore, heart I know your father has this minute, I'd thank God you got lost in, the fog, an' pray that you might never find your way off this 'ere ledge, so long as I lived.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It don't stand to reason he could hold his course long enough to hit, this 'ere ledge; but I reckon it's my duty as a Christian man an' a, light keeper to do what I can toward lendin' a hand. If he don't come, ashore here, the chances are mightily agin his strikin' land while the, breath is left in his body, for this 'ere smother is enough to mix up, anybody except an old shellback like me. Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd have been willin' to staid there, an' it was what I wanted to do,\\\", Uncle Zenas replied breathlessly, as he tried unsuccessfully to lower, his huge body through the narrow aperture. \\\"If the crew of this 'ere, light hadn't been so desperately lazy that they couldn't come down after, a little pair of glasses, we wouldn't be losin' the best mess of, fish-cakes that was ever put together on Carys' Ledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay, lad, but he came up within reach of the wreckage we went out to, look at. Again and again I yelled while you were cruising around, expecting to see me come to the surface near where I had disappeared;, but you didn't hear me, and then the fog shut down again. I gave myself, up for lost; but within an hour two fishermen in a dory blundered, along, and took me to their vessel three or four miles away. There was, no such thing as finding the _West Wind_ while the sea was covered with, fog so thick that it could almost be cut with a knife, and I've served, an apprenticeship as fisherman, eating my heart out because the skipper, wouldn't put into port until he had a full fare.\\\"\\n\\nDespite the protests of the shipwrecked men, they were sent to sleep in, the room used by the assistants. Uncle Zenas laid down a pile of, blankets in the kitchen for his couch, and the same kind of a bed was, made for Sidney in the watch-room, he begging for the privilege of, remaining there during the night, to the end that Mr. Peters and Captain, Eph might use the keeper's room.\\n\\n\\\"He's got to find a vessel bound for that port, an' then coax the cap'n, into givin' him a passage, all of which takes time. It don't stand to, reason, Sonny, that he'll get there, an' your messages can be sent in a, reg'lar letter, for of course your father wrote you an' me 'bout the, same time he telegraphed to the inspector. It seems to me everything has, come 'round jest as we'd like to have it, an' you're to stay here with, us!\\\"\\n\\nThe cook was brimming over with curiosity as to the nature of the, surprise which Mr. Peters had in store for them, and Captain Eph, confessed that he was \\\"all in the dark\\\"; but, remembering the shape of, some of the packages the first assistant brought with him, and his fear, lest they should get wet, Sidney believed he could make a very good, guess as to what was coming.\\n\\n\\\"I've been expectin' you'd ask that same question jest as soon as you'd, got well inter this 'ere light-house business, an' it strikes me you'll, know more about it by readin' somethin' I've put by here, than if I, spent the whole day tryin' to tell it in my clumsy way,\\\" the keeper said, as he gave to Sidney an open book, from which the lad read that which, follows:\\n\\n\\\"When you have the time there's nothin' to hinder your readin' what the, Board says about whistlin' buoys; but I won't promise that you'll be any, the wiser after doin' it, for in all these years I haven't been able to, get it through my head, though I've figgered out a gen'ral idee of how, she works. The top of the buoy is shaped a good deal like a pear, an', measures about twelve feet across the widest part. Inside the upper, part, an' runnin' down into the sea to a depth of thirty-two feet, is an, iron pipe thirty-three inches across it. Right at the very top of the, pipe, an' showin' above the whole thing, is a 10-inch locomotive, whistle, connected with some little tubes, which the inspector says make, a piston-and cylinder movement, whatever that may be.\\n\\n\\\"I allow there's a good chance for an argument there, Cap'n Eph; but, seein's how we're kind'er pressed for time, we'll let the matter drop a, spell, an' take it up when there's nothin' else on hand, I mean about, your havin' the right to make a report without my knowin' what's in it., Go ahead with the readin' an' then I'll explain how I count on fixin' up, Sonny's boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's no use talkin', Uncle Zenas, you lay way over anybody I ever, saw when it comes to cookin,' an' this 'ere lay-out is fit for the best, king that ever lived,\\\" the first assistant said approvingly, as he, applied himself industriously to getting a full share of all that had, been placed before him. \\\"It's growin' cold mighty fast, an' gives a man, quite an appetite to loaf around on the ledge only about half dressed.\\\"\\n\\nbecause she hasn't been on the station more'n two years. I don't claim, to be anything of a coward in seafarin' matters; but I never wanted any, part of a light-ship in weather like this. Let's have a look around the, lantern, lad. If a body don't feel jest right in mind, it's a good idee, to move about a bit, instead of stayin' in one place listenin', for the, wind does contrive to make some mighty queer noises.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then this is the way I look at the sitewation, Captain Eph,\\\" the first, assistant began, waving his knife in the air as if to attract attention., \\\"This 'ere fog mull may hang on for a week or ten days, an' since I've, been on the ledge I've known the smother to last a full two weeks, without liftin' enough to show a man the end of his own nose. It stands, to reason we can't hail any craft that we ain't able to see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Meantime the keepers of another light-house, fearing the ice, had, deserted their post, and gone on shore. The fact that no vessels could, have needed their lights while the ice remained unbroken, and that they, returned to their post when the danger had passed, did not avail them., So soon as the fact of their desertion was determined they were, dismissed the service, and the two keepers who had spent those terrible, hours afloat in Sharp's Island light-house, and then saved its, apparatus, were highly complimented by a letter direct from the Board, itself, and then were appointed to the deserters' places.\\n\\n\\\"After setting up the main derrick and cutting a pathway up the face of, the rock, they opened a bench around it by suspending the workmen on, staging supported by bolts let into the rock's crest. The bench once, formed, the reduction was pushed to the center. The outer surface of the, rock was easily removed with moderate charges of black powder, but the, nucleus was hard and firm, and giant powder was necessary to open the, mass, when large charges of black powder acted satisfactorily.\\n\\n\\\"I never think I'd like to be in the life-savin' service except at sich, a time as this,\\\" he said as he returned to the table. \\\"Even if the crew, can't really do anything, there must be a good deal of satisfaction in, makin' a big fight for it; but to be shut in a place like this, knowin', what's goin' on outside, gets on to a man's nerves worse'n anything I, ever struck. A hot battle ain't a marker alongside of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We bought what Sammy an' me both allowed was the proper kind of an, outfit for a boy who counted on spendin' the winter on Carys' Ledge, an', you'd seen the whole lot by this time, if you hadn't been in sich a, pucker for us to come to dinner,\\\" Captain Eph replied, much as if he, felt in some way injured because the meal had been served so promptly.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon we'll have to finish this 'ere talk some other time, for Uncle, Zenas does surely seem to be gettin' nervous. He's a mighty handy man, 'round a light-house; but I do wish he'd get over bein' so dreadful, particular about all hands settin' down to the table the very instant a, meal is ready. There are times, like this, when I'd rather linger a, little; but I don't dare to on account of his bein' so particular.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course these 'ere buoys are anchored in deep water, an' it stands to, reason that they rise an' fall on the waves, consequently the water, inside the big pipe pumps up an' down, compressin' the air till it jest, nat'rally has to escape through the whistle, makin' the noise. The whole, thing was invented by a man named Courtenay, an' I'm bound to say he, must have had a big head on his shoulders to think out sich a, contrivance. It may be, lad, that you'll understand it better by readin', from the report; but I can't tackle the big words, an' don't know a, piston or an apex from the Queen of Sheba, consequently it don't do me, any great amount of good to puzzle over 'em.\\n\\n\\\"Sammy!\\\" Captain Eph cried sharply. \\\"What do you mean by runnin', yourself down like that? Uncle Zenas an' I have summered an' wintered, with you, an' know there ain't a mean bone in your body, so don't let's, hear any more 'bout your bein' to blame for what happened this day. If I, hadn't yelled so loud, the fat wouldn't have been spilled, an' then I, shouldn't have blundered down-stairs like an old fool.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'At 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, the 16th, or ten hours before the, light fell, the platform above mentioned came ashore at Cohasset. As, this was forty-three feet above the line of low water, and twenty-eight, feet above high water, spring tides, the sea had at that time reached, within seven feet of the base of the store-room of the light-house., Without undertaking to speculate upon the probable shock that the, structure must have received from the effect of the sea upon a platform, fastened to the piles forty feet above the rock, it is enough to know, that the sea had reached within seven feet of the body or solid part of, the structure.\\n\\nan' there'll be no harm done if you don't hear what he's got to say for, two weeks to come. S'posen he's sent a message, which I don't believe he, has, for you to come to Porto Rico, what good would it do you to know, it, seein's how you can't get off this 'ere ledge till the sea goes, down? It's foolish to fret over what can't be helped. Tell me, did you, ever hear of a light called Barnegat?\\\"\\n\\nHere he found nothing contrary to the opinion he and his first assistant, had already formed--that she had been built as a tender to a large, vessel. A gasoline motor of 3 horse-power, with the appearance of having, been well cared for, was aft where the helmsman could attend to it while, holding the boat on her course, and lashed on either side inboard were, oars and spare fittings. Everything about the craft told that she had, lately been looked after by sailormen, and, having ascertained this, much, Captain Eph set about learning how seriously she had been damaged, by the rocks.\\n\\n\\\"I had lumber enough to make a hundred oars, but no tools with which to, put 'em in shape. I got out a piece of plankin', usin' my foot as a, thole-pin, an' in that way got the raft workin' more favorably in the, wind; but I couldn't raise the plank high enough out of the water. A big, wave caught the outer end, an' then I got sich a clip on the stomach as, knocked me silly. It looked as if I was pretty nigh my last gasp, an', jest then a sea swept me clean off the timbers. It's a solemn fact\\n\\nThe second assistant was by no means satisfied with this statement. He, declared that if the medals were not to be worn daily, they should at, least be kept where visitors would be certain to see them, and, threatened that, unless some arrangement of that kind were made, he, would resign his position of second assistant without delay, \\\"rather, than stay 'round with a couple of idjuts who didn't know enough to, spread themselves when they had the chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Government has got eighty-eight whistling buoys in position, an', every blessed one of 'em cost nigh to eleven hundred dollars. Then there, are one hundred an' thirty-nine bell-buoys which cost three hundred, dollars apiece, an' five thousand one hundred an' eighty-three other, buoys costin' different prices, so you see, lad, that outside the, light-house part of the service, it takes a big pile of money to buy, buoys an' keep 'em in position.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

He had the misfortune to show his, worst side to most people, and he had shown it to her. She had seen more, than once that he was ready to undertake and carry out almost anything, for his friend's sake, and she had been honestly grateful to him for all, he had done. But she had not been able, until now, to shake off that, feeling of distrust and timid dislike she had always felt in his, presence. She had, indeed, succeeded tolerably well in hiding it from, him, but it had always made her cold in conversation and somewhat formal, in manner, and he, being outwardly a rather formal and cold man had, so, to say, put himself in harmony with her key. For the first time in their, acquaintance, and under pressure of what he considered necessity, he had, suddenly unbent, and had told her the principal story of his life with a, frankness and simplicity that had charmed her. From that hour she judged, him differently. After that first visit, he went often to see her, and, on each occasion he felt drawn more closely to her than before.\\n\\nBut his manliness rose up at this and smote his cynicism out of the, field for a time. That little he owed Maddalena, at least--he could not, do less than defend her, at whatever cost, and he knew well enough that, he always would. As for his wish that she might know it, that was, nothing but his own detestable vanity. For his own part, he wished with, all his heart that the next morning might end his existence. He had, never valued his life very highly, and of late it had been so little to, his taste that he was more than ready to part with it, even violently., The future did not appall him, although, strangely enough, he was very, far from being an unbeliever, and had been brought up to consider a, sudden end, in mortal sin, as the most horrible and irreparable of, misfortunes. To him, in his experience of himself, no imaginable, suffering could be worse than the self-doubt, the self-contempt, and the, self-hatred which had so often tormented him during the past years. If, he were to be punished for his misdeeds with the same torture, even, though it were to be never-ending, at least he should bear the pain of, it alone, such as it was, without the necessity for hiding it and for, going through the daily mummery of life with an indifferent face. And in, that state there would be no more temptation of the kind he feared. What, he had done up to the hour of death would close the chronicle of evil\\n\\n\\\"I shall be very sincerely grateful for anything you can do to help the, wife of my old friend,\\\" he said. \\\"And I think you can do a good deal., You have great influence in the gay set--and that means the people who, talk the most--Donna Adele, Donna Maria Boccapaduli, the Marchesa di San, Giacinto, and all the rest, who are, more or less, your intimates. It is, very good of you to help me--Lady Herbert needs all the help she can, get. Spicca is a useful man, too. If he can be prevailed upon to say, something particularly witty at the right moment, it will do good.\\\"\\n\\nthe men had been circumspect in their remarks, but there were few who, did not make the sign when they saw her go by. If anything had been, needed to prove the fact, there was the issue of the duel. The man who, had taken Laura's side had nearly lost his life, though he had fought, several times previously without ever receiving any serious hurt. That, was proof positive. Adele's illness, too, dated almost from the day of, her reconciliation with Laura, and seemed likely to end fatally. Then\\n\\nGerano was obliged to admit that there was truth in this, though his, instinct told him that Ghisleri should be heard before being accused. He, was one of those men whose faith being once shaken is not easily, re-established, and he could not forget that his daughter had once, deceived him, a fact with which Savelli was now also acquainted, since, Adele had told him the whole truth about that part of the story, but to, which he attached relatively little importance as compared with, Ghisleri's villanous conduct in attempting to extort money from a member, of the Savelli family.\\n\\nShe walked again on that day, and by an almost superhuman effort kept, up appearances until bedtime, even succeeding in eating a moderately, abundant dinner. That night she told Lucia that, on the whole, she would, prefer to keep her, that she had always been more than satisfied with, her services, and that if she had suddenly felt an aversion to her, it, was the result of the extreme nervousness she had suffered of late. Now, that she could sleep, she realised how unkind she had been. Lucia humbly, thanked her, and said that she hoped to live and die in the service of, the most excellent Casa Savelli. Thereupon Adele thanked her too, said, very sweetly that she was a good girl and would some day be rewarded by, finding a good husband, and ended by giving her five francs. She, reflected that to give her more might look like the beginning of a, course of bribery, and that to give nothing might be construed as, proceeding from the fear of seeming to bribe.\\n\\nthe readiness to go to any length for the sake of real passion, the, power to hate honestly, to love faithfully, and to forgive wholly--all, things which Pietro missed in himself. And Laura had to-day waked the, memory of that great love which had once filled his existence, and which, had not ended with the life that had gone out before its day, in all its, beauty and freshness. He was grateful to her for that, and he sat long, in his chair after his lonely meal, thinking of her and of the other\\n\\nAnd she went on to give him an account of the baby life that so wholly, absorbed her thoughts. Ghisleri listened quietly as though he understood, it all. He wished, indeed, that it were possible to talk of something, else, and he felt something like a sensation of pain as Laura constantly, called the child \\\"Herbert,\\\" just as she had formerly been used to speak, of her husband. Nevertheless, he was conscious also of a certain sense, of satisfaction. During the month which had elapsed she had learned to, hide her great trouble under the joy of early motherhood. There was, something very beautiful in her devotion to the child of her sorrow, and, hurt though Ghisleri was by her manner to him, she seemed more lovely, and more admirable than ever in his eyes. He said so when he went to see, Maddalena dell' Armi late in the afternoon.\\n\\nMrs. Carlyon was very poor when she came to Rome. Her husband had been a, careless, good-humoured, and rather reckless younger son, and when he, broke his neck in coming down the Gross Glockner he left his widow about, as much as men of his stamp generally leave to their families; to wit, a, fearful and wonderful confusion of unpaid debts and a considerable, number of promises to pay money, signed by persons whose promises were, not of much consequence, even when clearly set down on paper. It seems, to be a peculiarity of poor and good-natured men that they will lend, whatever money they have to impecunious friends in distress rather than, use it for the paying of the just debts they owe their tailors.\\n\\nAdele looked very ill. By this time her complexion was of a pale, yellow, and she was thin to absolute emaciation. In spite of her, determined efforts to break the habit that was killing her, or perhaps, as a first consequence of them, she was liable to moments of nervousness, in which she could hardly control herself and in which she did not seem, to remember what had happened a few minutes earlier. Her sufferings at, such times were painful to see. She could hardly keep her hands from, moving about in a helpless fashion, and her face was often slightly, contorted. Very rarely, on fine days when she had been driving, a little, colour came into her ghastly cheeks. It was easy to see that only her, strong will supported her continually, and that women more weakly, organized would long ago have succumbed to the effects of the poison.\\n\\nLord Herbert and Laura lived in blissful ignorance of what was said, about them. The preparations for the wedding were already begun, and, Laura's modest trousseau was almost all ordered. She and Arden had, discussed their future, and having realised that they must live in a, very economical fashion for the present and so long as it pleased Heaven, to preserve Arden's maternal uncle among the living, they decided that, the wedding should be as quiet and unostentatious as possible. The old, Prince, however, though far too conscientious to have settled a penny of, his inherited fortune upon Laura, even if she had chosen to marry a, pauper, was not ungenerous in other ways, and considered himself at, liberty to offer the pair some very magnificent silver, which he was, able to pay for out of his private economies. As for Donna Adele, she, presented them with a couple of handsome wine-coolers--doubtless in, delicate allusion to the fictitious story about the champagne Lord, Herbert was supposed to have taken. The implied insult, if there was, any, was not at all noticed by those who had never heard the tale\\n\\nThe surgeon was surprised by something else in the case. As a general, rule, when a man fights a desperate duel in the very middle of the, season, and especially such a man as he knew Ghisleri to be, and is, severely hurt, he finds himself cut off from society in the midst of, some chain of events in which the whole present interest of his life is, engaged. He is consequently disturbed in mind, impatient of confinement\\n\\nfor love told his own tale plainly. Yet it seemed to him now that if he, had then thought Bianca as cold as he had reason to believe that Laura, was, he might have resigned himself to his fate at the beginning--he, might not have found the strength he now had to risk such a defeat as, perhaps waited him, to run any danger, now that he was free, rather than, live in suspense another day.\\n\\n, It was a relief to be with Laura Arden again for an hour on the day, after his return, as Ghisleri felt when he was installed beside her in, the chair which had come to be regarded as his. She received him just as, usual, and he saw at once that if she had at all resented his visit to, Adele, she was not by any means inclined to let him know it. There was a, freshness and purity in the atmosphere that surrounded her which, especially appealed to him after his visit to Gerano. Whatever she said, she meant, and if she meant anything she took no trouble to hide it. He, compared her face with her step-sister's, and the jaded, prematurely, world-worn look of the one threw the calm beauty of the other into, strong relief. He felt no pity for Adele. What she was, she had made, herself, and if she suffered, it was as the direct and inevitable, consequence of the life she had led and of the things she had done. So\\n\\n, The season had begun, but Pietro Ghisleri had little heart for going, into the world. Apart from the very sad scenes of which he had been a, witness so recently, he really mourned the loss of his friend with a, sincerity for which few would have given him credit. It would, of, course, have been an exaggeration to act as though Arden had been his, brother and to cast himself off from society for several months; but, during a fortnight after he had laid Lord Herbert in the Protestant, Cemetery at Monte Testaccio, he was seen nowhere. He went, indeed, to, the house of the Contessa dell' Armi, but he made his visits at hours, when no one else was received, as everybody knew, and he consequently, saw none of his acquaintances except in the street. Twice daily at, first, and then once, he went to the door of the Tempietto and sent up, for news of Laura and the child. Strange to say, after the first three, or four days the news became uniformly good. Ghisleri learned that the, little boy had come into the world sound and strong at all points\\n\\nThe sick man was unconscious and lay quite still on his back with closed, lids. The sister was on her feet, watching him intently. She shook her, head sadly when Ghisleri looked at her. The end was not far off, as she, in her great experience well knew. In hot haste Pietro sent for the, doctor, with a message saying that Lord Herbert was dying. But when he, came he admitted reluctantly that he could do nothing; there was no hope, even of prolonging life until morning.\\n\\nLaura hesitated a moment, and then slipped a five franc note with her, card into an envelope and addressed it as requested in the letter. On, the next day but one she received a second, full of gratitude, and, expressing the most humble and sincere thanks for the money, but not, asking for anything more. This also was copied from a genuine, communication, and the style was unmistakably the same. Adele had, answered the first by sending a larger sum than Laura had given, in, order that the reply might be relatively effusive.\\n\\nfor she had a good constitution and had rarely even had a headache. In, figure she was well proportioned, of average height and rather strongly, made, with large, firm, well-shaped hands. On the whole, a graceful, girl, but not in that way remarkable among others of her own age. In her, face, and altogether in her presence, the chief attraction lay in the, look of her eyes, which made one forget to notice the well-chiselled, nose,--a little short perhaps,--the really beautiful mouth, and the, perfect teeth. The chin, too, was broad and firm--too firm, some might, have said, for one so young. Considering all these facts together, most, people agreed that Laura was not far from being a great beauty.\\n\\nthrough the lovely gardens of Corfu. They ran in fair weather up to the, lagoons of Venice, and wandered in a gondola through the wide canals and, narrow water lanes of the most beautiful city in the world. Then down, the long Adriatic again, past Zara and Xanthe, round Matapan to the, Piraeus--then, when they had had their fill of Athens, away by one long, run to Sicily again, to Algiers next, and then to Barcelona and the, Spanish coast, homeward bound at last, towards England. For the weather, was growing warm now, and Laura noticed that she saw less often in, Arden's face the colour she had watched with such pleasure during the, first weeks. There was no cause for anxiety, she thought, but it was, possible that he needed always an even temperature, neither cold nor, hot, and it was time to reach England, before the July sun had scorched, the southern land.\\n\\nGhisleri laughed to himself, and at himself, as he went away, for being, so much impressed as he was by what Laura said. But he could not deny, that the impression had been made and remained for some time after he, had left her. There was a healthy common-sense about her mind which was, beginning to act upon the tortuous and often morbid complications of his, own. She seemed to know the straight paths and the short cuts to simple, goodness, and never to have guessed at the labyrinthine ways by which he, seemed to himself to be always trying to escape from the bugbear sent to, pursue him by the demon of self-mistrust. He laughed at himself, for he, realised how utterly impossible it would always be for him to think as, she did, or to look upon the world as she saw it. There had been a time, when he had thought more plainly, when a woman had exerted a strong, influence over him, and when a few good things and a few bad ones had, made up the sum of his life. But she was dead, and he had changed. Worse, than that, he had fallen. As he sat in his room and glanced from time to, time at the only likeness he had of Bianca Corleone, he thought of, Beatrice's reproach to Dante in the thirty-first canto of the, \\\"Purgatory\\\":\\n\\nThereupon Ghisleri passed on, inwardly wondering how long it would be, before Adele became quite mad. Two days later he received a note from, her. She had heard from her husband that he was in Rome, she said, and, wrote to ask a great favour of him. He was doubtless aware of her, father's passion for manuscripts, which was well known in Rome. It was, reported that a certain dealer had bought Prince Montevarchi's library, after the crash, and she very much wished to buy a very interesting, manuscript of which she had often heard her father speak, and which, contained an account of the famous, or infamous, Isabella Montevarchi's, life, written with her own hand--a sort of confession, in fact. As she, did not know the exact title of the document, if it had any, she would, call it a confession, though, of course, in a strictly lay sense. Now\\n\\n\\\"Send me Giacomo,\\\" said Adele, holding the letter in her hand, but as, Lucia went towards the door, she stopped her. \\\"No,\\\" she said suddenly., \\\"Take this to him yourself; tell him to have it registered at once, and, to bring me back the receipt from the post-office. Tell him to be, careful, as it is very important. I am going to lie down. Come to me, some time before sunset.\\\"\\n\\nthough its greater light had gone out. The anguish, the agonising, anxiety, the first moment's joy, and at last the full pride of, motherhood, had come between her and the past, deadening the terrible, shock at first, and making the memory of it less keen and poignant, afterwards, while not in any way dimming the bright recollection of the, love that had united her to her husband. She could take pleasure now in, looking forward to her boy's coming years, to the time when he should be, at first a companion, then a friend, and then a protector of whom she, would be proud when he stood among other men. She could think of his, schooldays, and she could already feel the pain of parting from him and, the joy of meeting him again, taller and stronger and braver at every, return. And far away in the hazy distance before her she could see a, shadowy but lovely figure, yet unknown to-day--Herbert's wife that was, to be, a perfect woman, and worthy of him in all ways. It might be also, that somewhere there were great deeds for Herbert to do, fame for him to, achieve, glory for him to win. All this was possible, but she thought, little of it. Her ambition was to know him some day to be all that his, father had been in heart, and to see him all that his father should have, been in outward form and stature. More than that she neither hoped nor, asked for, and perhaps it was enough. And so she dreamed on, while no, one thought she was dreaming at all, for she was always active and busy, with something that concerned the child, and her attention never, wandered when it was needed.\\n\\nand to tell her so, if he chose. No one could blame him for wishing to, marry her; at most he might be thought foolish for desiring anything so, very improbable as that she should accept him. But he was quite, indifferent to what any one might think of him excepting Laura herself., One resolution only he made and did his best to keep, and it was a good, one. He made up his mind that he would not make love to her, as he, understood the meaning of the term. Possibly, as he told himself with a, little scorn, this was no resolution at all, but only a way of, expressing his conviction that he was quite unable to do what he so, magnanimously refused to attempt. For his instinct told him that his, love for Laura had already taken a shape which differed wholly from all, former passions, one unfamiliar to him, one which would need a new, expression if it continued to be sincere. But that he doubted. He was, quite ready to admit that when Laura came back in the autumn, this early, beginning of love would have disappeared again, and that the old strong, friendship would be found in its place, solid, firmly based, and, unchanged, a permanent happiness and a constant satisfaction. He was no, longer a boy, to imagine that the first breath of love was the, forerunner of an all-destroying storm in which he must perish, or of a, clear, fair wind before which the ship of his life was to run her, straight course to the haven of death's peace. He had seen too much, fickleness in himself and in others to believe in any such thing; but if, he had anticipated either it would have been the tempest. On the whole\\n\\nand he would not hear of her accompanying him on any condition. He, assured her that with his fur coat, and in a closed carriage with a, foot-warmer, he was as safe as at home in the drawing-room, and he gave, her to understand that he had a small surprise in store for her, of, which all the effect would be spoiled if she went with him. Very, reluctantly she let him go. Even after he was gone, when she heard the, brougham rattling down the Via Gregoriana, she was tempted to open the, window and call the driver back. Then she reflected that she was, probably foolish in being so anxious, since he now seemed almost as well, as ever.\\n\\nHe was hard to catch. So far as she could learn, he had changed his mode, of life very considerably during the past two years. It was quite, certain that he had definitely broken with Maddalena dell' Armi, though, no one was really sure of the exact date at which the rupture had taken, place. They were both clever people who kept their secrets to themselves, on the simple plan that, if a thing is not to be known, it should not be, told. Laura was the only other woman whom he visited regularly, and his, doings were far too well known to make it possible to float a scandal, about him in connexion with some one else, which should reach Laura's, ears. Besides, Laura would not care. She was quite capable of not taking, the slightest notice, just as in former times she had not cared whether, he saw Maddalena every day or not. All she wanted, thought Adele, was, that Ghisleri should be at her feet--and there he was.\\n\\nBut as chance would have it, the Contessa found herself talking to San, Giacinto one evening, when she was feeling very lonely and unhappy, and, her half-formed resolution broke down as suddenly as it had presented, itself. The giant looked at her keenly for a moment, bent his heavy, black brows, and then told her the story of what had taken place at the, club. He, who saw most things, and talked little of them, noted the, gradual change in her face, and how the light came back to it while he, was speaking. She understood that the man whom she had accused of, betraying his friend had faced a roomful of men in his defence, and on, the very ground now under discussion, and she repented of what she had, done. Then she swore vengeance on Adele Savelli.\\n\\n\\\"That is always a most disagreeable position,\\\" she said boldly. \\\"We were, talking about it the other day. I wish you had been there. Gouache was, telling a foreigner--Prince Durakoff, I think it was--the old story of, how Prince Montevarchi was murdered by his own librarian because he, would not pay the man a sum of money in the way of blackmail. You know, it, of course. The two families, the Montevarchi and the Saracinesca\\n\\n\\\"Very easily. You can understand it too. When I knew that I loved you, I, knew--I believed, at least, that another suffering had been found for, me, as though I had not enough already. Of course, I was hopeless. How, could I tell, how could any one guess that you--you of all women--with, your beauty, your youth, your splendid woman's heart--could ever care, for me? Oh, my darling--dear, dearest--is there no other word? If I, could only tell you half!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could have done it quite as well yourself, only I knew you would, not do it at all,\\\" answered the latter. \\\"I have no scruples in dealing, with such people, nor do I see why any one should have any. But you, would have gone delicately and presented Donna Adele with the, confession, and then when she had burned it before your eyes, you would, have told her that you trusted to her sense of justice to right you in, the opinion of the world.\\\"\\n\\nespecially as regards your taste in sin, which was perfect and perhaps, is still. But marriage is not at all artistic, my dear Ghisleri, until, it becomes unhappy, and the husband goes about with a revolver in every, pocket, and the wife with a scent bottle full of morphia in hers, and, they treat each other with distant civility in private, and with, effusive affection when a third person is present, especially the third, person who has contributed the most to producing the artistic effect in, question. Then the matter becomes interesting.\\\"\\n\\nthough Pietro was looking better than in the afternoon. The two had, evidently been dancing together, for the Contessa's white neck heaved a, little, as though she were still out of breath. She was a short, slight, woman of exquisite figure, very fair, with deep violet eyes and small, classic features, almost hard in their regularity; evidently wilful and, dominant in character. Arden watched the pair as they went on in search, of a vacant sofa just big enough for two.\\n\\nIn the early summer Laura and her husband were at Torre de' Ghisleri in, the Tuscan hills. The small castle was very habitable as compared with, its former condition, and small as it was by comparison with such, fortresses as Gerano, was by no means the mere ruined tower which many, people supposed it to be. The square grey keep from which it took its, name was flanked by a mass of smaller buildings, irregular and of, different epochs, all more or less covered with ivy or with creepers now, in bloom. The wide castle yard, in the midst of which stood the ancient, well with its wonderfully wrought yoke of iron, its heavy chain, and its, two buckets, had been converted into a garden long ago for the bride of, some Ghisleri of those days, and the plants and trees had run almost, wild for a hundred years, irregularly, as some had survived and others, had perished in the winter storms. Here a cypress, there an oak, further, on again three laurels, of the Laura Regia kind, side by side in a row\\n\\n\\\"It is very simple. I think that no love is worth the name which does, not influence a man strongly for at least ten years. Any really great, passion will do that. But human life is short. Let a man fall in love at, twenty, and three periods of ten years each will bring him to fifty. A, man who falls in love after he is fifty is a rarity, and generally an, object of ridicule. That seems to me a logical demonstration, and I do, not see why it should not apply to a woman as well as to a man.\\\"\\n\\nin his imagination, every conceivable expedient by which he fancied that, he might enjoy Laura's society without compromising her in any way. In, such cases, however, it is hard to find a stratagem which shall at once, satisfy the exigencies of the situation, and an honest man's conscience, and sense of honour. He had long given up the custom of going to see, Laura every other day, and when she was at her mother's house he was, rarely invited, on account of the Princess's prejudice against him, and, which no good conduct on his part seemed capable of destroying. To give, up seeing Laura altogether was a sacrifice so great that he did not feel, strong enough to make it; nor, perhaps, would Laura herself have, understood it. Yet, unless he kept away from her for a long time, he, knew that the all-wise world would continue to say that he saw her, every day. The more he thought about it, the harder he found it to come, to any decision. Considering the terms on which he now saw her, and that, in former times they had more than once spoken of the same matter, he at, last reluctantly resolved to lay the question before her, and to let her, decide what he should do. He hated to ask advice of any one, and he, detested even the appearance of shifting responsibility upon another., But he could see no other way.\\n\\nFor the third time since Arden's death the conviction came upon him that, Adele had been the responsible cause of it, and this time it was, destined to be permanent. The theory of coincidence was exhausted, and, he abandoned it. The stories he had told her about Professor, Wuesterschinder, the great German authority, were quite true, and, Ghisleri's eyes had been opened on the previous evening to the, possibilities of evil disclosed by modern science. He was not yet sure, of what Adele had done, but he was convinced that the general nature of, the process she had employed to communicate the fever to Arden was, similar to those which the professor had described, and that she must\\n\\nwas looking somewhat haggard and weary, and the Contessa met the world, that evening with a stony stare. There was endless matter for, speculation, and accordingly the world speculated without end, and, as, usual, to no purpose. Ghisleri was absolutely reticent, and Maddalena, was a very proud woman, who, in spite of her past sufferings, did her, best not to let any one suspect that she and her husband were on bad, terms. She was also unhappy in the present about a very different, matter, concerning which she was not inclined to speak with any one., Donna Adele's last decided attempt to defame Lord Herbert Arden had, to, a certain extent, been successful, but it had also produced another, result of which Adele did not know, but which would have given her even, greater satisfaction. It had almost caused a quarrel between Ghisleri, and the Contessa.\\n\\nand was not above making use of them. Probably some part of the effect, produced by Laura's eyes was due to the evenly perfect whiteness of her, skin and the straight black brows which divided them from the broad low, forehead. For her hair grew low, and she wore it in a simple fashion, without that abundance of little curls which even then were considered, almost essential to woman's beauty. Her pallor, too, was quite natural\\n\\nAs soon as her mother was gone, Laura wrote a note to Pietro, telling, him that she had heard all the story, that she believed in him as firmly, as ever, and begging him to come and see her on the following day at the, usual hour. The last words dropped from her pen naturally. It seemed but, yesterday that they had spoken of meeting \\\"at the usual hour\\\" on the, morrow of the day after that. Ghisleri's heart beat faster as he broke, the seal, and when he came to the words he was conscious that its, beating annoyed him. He knew, now, that he loved her well, as he had, loved but once before in his life. But he determined that he would not, go and see her. He blessed her for believing in his innocence, but there, were many strong reasons against his going to her house, or even seeing, her. Merely on general grounds he would have kept away, while under the, accusation which hung over him, as even the Princess of Gerano had, anticipated that he would, and feeling as he did that he loved her in, good earnest, it would have seemed absolutely dishonourable to renew, their former relations until he had cleared himself. He wrote her a, short note.\\n\\nshe inquired, would Ghisleri, for old friendship's sake, try to obtain, it for her at a reasonable price? She knew, of course, that such an, original would be expensive, but she was prepared to discuss the terms, if not wholly beyond her means. She sent her note by the carrier, as, that was generally quicker than writing by the post, she said. Would, Ghisleri kindly answer by the same means? The man would call again on, the next day but one. That would perhaps give time to make preliminary, inquiries. With which observation, and with best thanks in anticipation, of the service he was about to render, Adele called herself most, sincerely his.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he took care that we should be, by killing all the other branches, of the family. Those hollows in the stone are supposed to have been made, by his footsteps. Think what a walk! It lasted eighteen years. But it is, an airy place and not damp. Those windows were there then, they say. Do, you see that deep channel in the wall? It leads straight up through the, castle to the floor of the little passage between the old guard-room, and one of the towers. There used to be a trap-door--it was still there, when I was a little girl, but my father has had a slab of stone put down, instead. They used to entice their dearest and most familiar enemies up, there, and just as the man set foot on the board a soldier in the tower, pulled a bolt in the wall and the trap-door fell. It is two hundred, feet, they say. It was so cleverly managed! They say that the last, person who came to grief there was a Monsignor Boccapaduli in the year, sixteen hundred and something, but no one ever knew what had become of, him until the next generation.\\\"\\n\\nand hated Laura Arden for being the evil-eyed cause of all his, misfortunes. How could he still go to see her, knowing, as he must, how, dangerous it was? Had she not almost killed him and Adele, as well as, quite killing her husband? People who touched Laura Arden's hand would, do well to shut themselves up and lie safe at home for four and twenty, hours, until the power of the jettatura was past. Those black eyes of, hers meant no good to any one, in spite of her inspired, nun-like looks.\\n\\ncould he have seen her pale and tear-stained face as she sat motionless, in the place where he had left her, he might possibly have been weak, enough to yield, strong as his determination was not to do so. But that, sight was spared him, and he was glad that he had held his peace when, she had paused to give him an opportunity of speaking. It was far better, so. To act a miserable play with her, no matter from what so-called, honourable motive of consideration, would be to make her life far more, unhappy than it would ultimately be if she knew the truth. He was, satisfied with what he had done, therefore, when he went back to his, rooms and lay down to rest after the fatigue of his first day out. But, the meeting had left a very sad and painful impression, and all that he, felt of remorse and regret for what he had done was doubled now. He, hated to think that by his fault she was cast upon the world, with, little left to save her, \\\"trying to amuse herself,\\\" as she had said, and, he wondered at her gentleness and kindness to himself, so different from, her behaviour at their last meeting. That, at least, comforted him. In a, woman who could thus forgive there must be depths of goodness which, would ultimately come to the surface. He remembered how often he had, thought her hard, unjust, unkind, and, above all, unbelieving, in the, days that succeeded the first outbursts of unreasoning love, and how\\n\\nHis first step was to find out the name of the dealer who had bought the, Montevarchi library. He next ascertained that what Adele wanted was, still unsold, and that he must therefore necessarily enter into, correspondence with her. After that he sought out a young lawyer whom he, had employed once or twice within the last few years when he had needed, legal advice in regard to some trifling point, and laid the whole matter, before him. This young man, Ubaldini by name, had rapidly acquired a, reputation as a criminal lawyer, and had successfully defended some, remarkable cases, but, as he justly observed, acquitted prisoners of the, classes in which crimes are common, pay very little, and condemned, criminals pay nothing at all. He was therefore under the necessity of, taking other kinds of business as a means of support. The last murderer, who had escaped the law by Ubaldini's eloquence had sent him a bag of, beans and a cream cheese, which was all the family could afford in the, way of a fee, but upon which a barrister who had a taste for variety, could not subsist any length of time.\\n\\nconsidering that for years they had met and acted with perfectly civil, indifference towards one another. Nevertheless, he relit his cigarette, which had gone out, and made a step towards the other side of the room., To Campodonico, the calm expression of his face seemed like scorn, and, he became exasperated in a moment. He called the other back. They were, at some distance from the other guests, and out of hearing if they spoke, in low tones.\\n\\nBut it was clear that the die was cast, and that war was declared. More, than ever, he was glad that Laura Arden was not in Rome. The thought, that if she were present she would necessarily have to follow the course, of events little by little, as he must himself, and the certainty that, she knew the truth and would feel the keenest sympathy for him, made him, rejoice at her absence. When she learned what had taken place, she would, know all the circumstances at once, including Ghisleri's proof of his, innocence, which, as he felt sure, would be triumphant. In the meantime\\n\\nSavelli began to speak, and, as he had promised, he stated the case as, he had heard it from Adele and, on the whole, very much as she had, summed it up in her own mind before going to him. Ghisleri sat with, folded arms and bent brows, listening to the wonderfully connected chain, of false testimony she brought against him, with all the courage and, calmness he could command.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Laura answered. \\\"And then, after all, I have known you ever since, I first went out as a young girl. I did not like you at first, I, remember, though I could never tell why. But as for your saying that you, cannot see why I should still be your friend, I do not understand how, you mean it. It seems to me that you have done much to get my friendship, and to strengthen it, and nothing to lose it. Besides, you yourself know, that you are not what you were. You have changed. You were saying so, only yesterday, and you said the change was for the better.\\\"\\n\\nIf Laura Arden had been present she would have been more than ever, inclined to distrust Ghisleri just then. She would have wondered what, possessed him to make him say things so very different from those he, generally said to her. As a matter of fact, he wished Adele to trust, him, for especial reasons, and he knew her well enough to judge how his, speeches would affect her. She had betrayed herself to him a few minutes, earlier and he desired to efface the impression in her mind before, leading her into another trap.\\n\\nThere was no exaggeration in the Contessa's account. The story was, actually in circulation, if the lost confession was not. Unlike the, majority of such tales, however, this one was not openly repeated or, commented upon where more than two people were present. It disappeared, and reappeared in unexpected places like the river Alpheus of old, but, its shape was not materially changed. It was told in whispers and under, terrible oaths of secrecy, and occasionally--very rarely, indeed--the, mere word \\\"Confession,\\\" spoken in casual conversation, made people smile, and look at each other. There was not even a scandalous little, paragraph in any of the daily papers, referring to it. For there are, moments when society can keep its secrets, strangely communicative as it, is at other times. The houses of Savelli and Gerano were too important, and, in a way, too powerful still, to be carelessly attacked. Indeed\\n\\nHe wrote a note to his cousin, the Prince of Sant' Ilario, another to, Gianforte Campodonico, and then a rather longer one to Savelli. In the, last mentioned, he informed the Prince that he would appear on the, morrow, with Campodonico and Sant' Ilario, and that he desired to be, received by Savelli himself in the presence of Francesco and Adele, as, he had a communication of the highest importance to make. In his usual, hard way he managed to convey the impression that it would be decidedly, the worse for the whole house of Savelli and for Adele in particular if, his request were not complied with to the letter. By the time he had, finished a servant announced that the carriage was waiting. San Giacinto, thrust a handful of black cigars and a box of matches into his outer, pocket.\\n\\nTo those who watch the changing world with its manifold scenes and its, innumerable actors, whose merest farce is ever and only the prologue to, the tragedy which awaits all, there is nothing more wonderful, nothing, more beautiful, nothing more touching--perhaps few things more, sacred--than the awakening of a noble heart at love's first magic touch., The greater miracle of spring is done before our eyes each year, the sun, shines and the grass grows, it rains and all things are refreshed, and, the dead seed's heart breaks with the joy of coming life, bursts and, shoots up to meet the warmth of the sunshine and be kissed by the west, wind. But we do not see, or seeing, care for none of these things in the, same measure in which we care for ourselves--and perhaps for others. We, turn from the budding flower wearily enough at last, and we own that, though it speak to us and touch us, its language is all but strange and, its meaning wholly a mystery. Nature tells us little except by, association with hearts that have beaten for ours, and then sometimes, she tells us all. But the heart itself is the thing, the reality, the, seat of all our thoughts and the stay of all our being. Selfishly we see, what it does in ourselves, and in others we may see it and watch it, without thought of self. It is asleep to-day, lethargic, heavy, dull\\n\\nPeople talked for some time of the Shrove Tuesday feast at Gouache's, studio. Then they fell to talking about other things. Lent passed in the, usual way, and there was not much change in the lives of the persons, most concerned in this history. Ghisleri saw much less of Arden than, formerly, of course, as the latter was wholly absorbed by his passion, for his future wife. As for the world, it was as much occupied with, dinner parties, musical evenings, and private theatricals as it had, formerly been with dancing. The time sped quickly. The past season had, left behind it an enormous Corpus Scandalorum Romanorum which made, conversation both easy and delightful. How many of the unpleasant, stories concerning Lord Herbert Arden, Laura Carlyon, Pietro Ghisleri\\n\\nThe Sister of Charity went about with Maddalena's bracelet in her, pocket, feeling very uncomfortable about it, since she had been quite, sure from the first that there was something very sinful in the whole, affair. But she was quite ready to fulfil her promise if Ghisleri showed, signs of departing this life, which he did not, however, either when he, first regained consciousness or later. So she, on her part, said, nothing, and waited for the day when she might deliver up the trinket to, the Mother Superior, to be sold for the poor, as Maddalena had directed., In that, at least, there could be no harm, and she was very thankful, that she was not called upon to deliver the message to Ghisleri himself\\n\\nAnd throughout all this quiet time the song of happiness was ever in, their ears. The world they cared so little for, and which had taken the, trouble to say such disagreeable things about them, was left infinitely, far behind in their new life. From time to time letters reached Laura, from Rome, and Arden had one from Ghisleri, containing little detailed, news, but full of angry threats at a kind of general undefined enemy\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Laura. \\\"It was all a mistake, then?\\\" \\\"Yes. But I suppose, Campodonico was irritated. In the drawing-room I lit a cigarette, and, stood some time looking at a copy of Zichy's picture of Tamara falling, into the Demon's arms. Tamara chances to be a very striking likeness of, the Princess Corleone, and if I had reflected that Campodonico might, have also noticed the fact, I would not have stood there looking at it, as I did. But I forgot. Before I knew it, he was at my elbow, evidently, very angry, for he perfectly understood why I liked the picture. He, asked me whether I did not think that a solemn promise such as we had, made might be broken under certain circumstances. I said I did not think, so. He lost his temper completely, and said I was a coward. I still, refused to quarrel with him, and he grew more and more insulting, until, at last he began a sentence which I would not let him end, to the effect, that, could Donna Bianca have been there to judge us both, she might, wish the promise broken--I suppose that would have been his, inference--if she could have seen that the man she had loved had fallen, so low as to love the lady to whom I referred a little while ago. He, named her. I answered that Donna Bianca never meant that our promise, should shield the liar who slandered a good and defenceless woman\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad to hear of your engagement, my dear old brother,\\\" he, wrote. \\\"They say Miss Carlyon is good and beautiful. I have no doubt she, is, though I do not at this moment recollect knowing any woman who was, both. I have sent the yacht to Naples for you, if you care for a cruise., Keep her as long as you like, and telegraph if you want her sent, anywhere else--Nice, for instance, or Venice. Ask your wife to wear the, pearls by way of making acquaintance at second hand. They are what I, could find. I send a man with them, as they might get lost. Now, good-bye, dear boy, enjoy yourself and come to us as soon as you can., Yours ever, HARRY.\\n\\nAll Ghisleri's suspicions revived at the news Maddalena gave him. Again, he took down the medical work he had consulted on the evening when the, idea that Adele was in some way guilty of Arden's death had first, flashed across his mind, more than a year previously. Again he read the, chapter on scarlet fever carefully from beginning to end, and sat down, to think over the possibilities in such a case, and once more, after, several days of serious consideration, he grew sceptical, and abandoned, the attempt to fathom the mystery, if mystery there were. He knew that, even without that, Adele might have written many things to her confessor, in confidence which, if repeated openly in the world, would do her, terrible harm. He was quite sure that all the infamous slanders on, Laura and her husband could ultimately be traced to Adele alone, and it, was possible that the stolen document contained a full account of them\\n\\nwith its back to the side of the room the guests crossed who went, directly to the ball-room, and facing the side by which they went from, the ball-room to the rooms beyond, and to the supper-room, for there, were four doors, opposite each other, two of which opened into the, great hall where the dancing was going on. Maddalena was seated at the, end of the sofa which was against the pillar, so that a person passing, through behind her might easily not notice her presence.\\n\\nThe connexion between him and Arden was in reality so distant, that they, had never assumed even the outward forms of intimacy, though their wives, called each other sister. Savelli disliked Lord Herbert because he was a, cripple, and chiefly because he had married Laura Carlyon. Arden, on his, side, was more or less indifferent to Francesco, but treated him always, with a shade more warmth than an ordinary acquaintance, as being, in a, sense, a member of his wife's family.\\n\\nhigh or low. The largest of the large open carriages belonging to Casa, San Giacinto was seen rolling solemnly through the city, bearing Pietro, Ghisleri, the Marchese di San Giacinto himself, and two policemen, who, looked very uncomfortable as they sat, bolt upright, side by side, with, their backs to the horses. A few hours later, the same carriage appeared, again, Pietro and the giant being still in it, but without the officers, of the law. San Giacinto insisted upon driving his friend six times, round the Villa Borghese, six times round the Pincio, and four times the, length of the Corso, before taking him back at last to his lodgings.\\n\\nand it was at least a good one. Loving her with all their hearts, in, their different ways, both Ghisleri and Campodonico respected the, obligation they had taken as something supremely sacred. Ghisleri went, and lived alone in a remote village of the south for more than a year, afterwards, and Gianforte spent an even longer period in almost total, seclusion from the world, and in the sole society of his widowed mother., Three years before the time now reached in this chronicle, he had, married, as people said, for love, and for once people were right. His, elder brother bore the title, and as there was another sister besides, the Princess Corleone, Gianforte's portion had been small, for the, family was not rich, and he and his wife lived very modestly in a small, apartment in the upper part of the city, the Palazzo Campodonico having, long ago passed into the hands of the Savelli.\\n\\nwith a vague idea that he might ultimately get the old estate together, again. He generally bought on mortgage, binding himself to pay at a, certain date, and as he was a very honourable man in all financial, transactions, he invariably paid, though sometimes at considerable, sacrifice. He said to himself that unless he were bound he would, inevitably throw away the little money he had to spare. It was a, curiously practical trait in such an unruly and almost lawless, character, but he did such things when he could, and then thought no, more about them until a fresh opportunity presented itself. He was a man, whose life and whole power of interest in life were almost constantly, absorbed by the two or three persons to whom he was sincerely attached\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course. But if there is to be that sort of conversation, it can, always take the form of a discussion, and one can put oneself on the, right side from the beginning just as easily as not. It saves so much, trouble afterwards. The person who is always on the wrong side is, generally the one about whom the others are talking. If we could hear a, tenth of what is said about ourselves I fancy we should be very, uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\nThe maid, Lucia by name, had for some time expected that her days in, Casa Savelli were numbered, for Adele had shown her dislike very plainly, of late, so that the woman did not show much surprise, and accepted her, dismissal respectfully and quietly, promising herself to tell tales in, her next place concerning Adele's toilette which, though without the, slightest foundation, would be repeated and believed all over Rome.\\n\\nHaving concluded his sermon, Gerano kissed Adele on the forehead, as he, was accustomed to do. She bent her head in silence, for she was so angry, that she could not trust herself to speak, and he left her at the door, and went home. All things considered, she knew that she had reason to be, grateful for his forbearance. She was quite sure that her father-in-law, would have behaved differently, and the stories she had heard of old, Prince Saracinesca's temper showed clearly that the race of violent, fathers was by no means yet extinct. She was not even called upon to, make a formal apology to Laura in her father's presence, which was what, she had at first expected and feared. Nothing, in fact, was required of, her except to avoid gossip and treat the Ardens with a decent show of, sisterly affection. She could scarcely have got better terms of peace\\n\\n\\\"You will everywhere say nice things about Laura and her husband. You, will say that you are now positively sure that Arden does not drink. You, will say that there is no truth whatever in the report that Laura is in, love with Francesco, and that you are absolutely certain that the Ardens, are very happy together. Those are the principal points, I believe. You, will also at once ask them to dinner, and you will repeat your, invitation often, and behave to both in a proper way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not want you to make love to me,\\\" Adele answered, \\\"though I, believe you know how to do it to perfection. It is often a very long way, from liking very much to loving a very little. This is the place where, old Gianluca kept his brother Paolo in prison for eighteen years. Then, Gianluca died suddenly one fine morning, and Paolo was let out by the, soldiers and immediately threw Gianluca's wife out of the window of the, east tower, and cut off the heads of his two sons on the same afternoon., I will show you where that was done when we go up stairs. Paolo was an, extremely energetic person.\\\"\\n\\nGhisleri started early, taking his servant with him, and reached Gerano, in time for the midday breakfast. Francesco Savelli received him with, considerable enthusiasm, and Adele's habitually rather forced smile, became more natural. Both felt in different ways that the presence of a, third person was a relief, and would have been delighted to receive a, far less agreeable man than their present guest. They overwhelmed him, with questions about Rome and their friends.\\n\\nShe paused and looked at him. He knew what she meant. If there were a, spark of love, she would forget everything and take him back on any, terms. For a moment the old struggle was violently resumed in his heart., Ought he not, for her sake, to pretend love, and to live out his life as, best he could in the letter of devotion if not in the true spirit of, love? Or would not such an attempt necessarily be a failure, and bring, her more and more unhappiness with each month and year? He only, hesitated for an instant while she paused; then he determined to say, nothing. That was really the turning-point in Pietro Ghisleri's life.\\n\\n\\\"If you happen to be a good hand at forgery,\\\" answered Ghisleri, with, perfect equanimity, \\\"write a number of letters purporting to be from him, to another woman. Put anything you like into them, take them to the, woman who loves him, and ask a large sum for them. She will probably pay, it and leave him. You will accomplish your object and earn money at the, same time. If you cannot forge his handwriting, forge that of an, imaginary woman--that is easy enough--and follow the same course as, before. It is almost sure to succeed.\\\"\\n\\nAdele dressed herself for going out and left the room. But instead of, joining her husband and Ghisleri at once, she turned out of the main, passage by the cross corridor which led to the court-yard, went out and, walked quickly down the inclined road by which she had led Ghisleri to, Paolo Braccio's dungeon. There, where the shaft of the oubliette came, down, she was quite sure of finding the little package of sheets which, meant so much to her and which had almost meant a fortune to Lucia. She, crossed the worn pavement rapidly. There was plenty of light from the, grated windows high up under the vault, and she could have seen the, paper almost as soon as she entered the place. She stopped short as she, reached the foot of the channel in the wall. There was nothing there., She stared up into the blackness above in the hope of seeing a white, thing caught and sticking to the stones, but she could not distinguish, the faintest reflection of anything. Yet she was convinced that the, thing must have fallen all the way. The shaft, as she well knew, was, quite perpendicular and the masonry compact and well finished. The, object of those who had built it had been precisely to prevent the, possibility of the victim catching on a projection of any sort while, falling.\\n\\nYet she did not look well. There was an odd, half-frightened look in her, eyes when they were all gone and she was left alone with her husband., But he did not notice it, and made it easy for her, bestowing infinite, praise upon her tact and talent as a hostess. Though she did not hear, all he said, she was vaguely pleased, that, after spending the whole, evening at Laura's side, he should stay at home instead of going to the, club, and find so many pleasant things to say. In spite of her success\\n\\nAs he repeated the last words he started for they reminded him with, painful force of Gianforte Campodonico's insulting speech, and he, detested himself for even allowing the thought to cross his mind--for, allowing himself to repeat Beatrice's words up to that point. It was he, who had dragged down Maddalena dell' Armi to his level, not she who had, made him sink to hers. And yet Campodonico had said almost the same, thing as Beatrice, and certainly without knowing it. In his heart he, knew that Bianca might have reproached him so, but then, deeper still\\n\\nwith the intention of believing oneself to be passionate by nature, and, in that sense the weakness could not justly be attributed to Ghisleri., But on this particular night he did a thing which many people would, undoubtedly have called sentimental. He turned aside from the highway, when he left the great palace in which Gouache lived, and he allowed, himself to wander aimlessly on through the older part of the city, until, he stopped opposite to the door of a church which stood in a broad, street near the end of the last by-way he had traversed. The night was, dark and gloomy and the stillness was only broken now and then by a, distant snatch of song, a burst of laughter, or the careless twang of a, guitar, just as Ghisleri had described it. Indeed it was by no means the, first time that he had walked home in the small hours of Ash Wednesday, morning, after a night of gaiety and emotion.\\n\\nthere lay another thought which he would not now evoke, lest he should, himself condemn it as sentimental. That secret promise had been honestly, intended, and had been addressed to the memory of one who, though long, dead, still had a stronger influence over him than any one now living., He hardly dared to acknowledge the truth of this and the real meaning of, what he had done, lest, if he failed hereafter, he should have to accuse, himself of faithlessness towards the one woman to whom he had been, really true, and whom, if she had lived, he would have loved till the, end, in spite of obstacles, in spite of mankind, in spite, he added, defiantly, of Heaven itself. All this he tried to keep out of sight\\n\\n\\\"It is the most absurd story I ever heard,\\\" he said. \\\"I ought not even, to say I heard it, for I guessed it from little things that happened., People think that your step-sister's husband, Savelli, is in love with, you, and I suppose they imagine that you have something to do with, it--encouraged him, and that sort of thing. I am quite sure that Donna, Adele--am I to call her Adele now?--is jealous, for I have witnessed the, manifestation with my own eyes. It is all too utterly ridiculous, but as, you are quite English you were at a disadvantage, and were not as, popular as you ought to have been.\\\"\\n\\nin order to show how high a value Ghisleri set upon the confession which, contained a concise account of her doings. But he would, in any case, be, prejudiced against her from the first. One thing was in her favour, she, thought. The Princess of Gerano did not like Ghisleri, and would in all, likelihood be ready to believe evil of him, and to influence her, husband, good and just woman though she was. There was one other person, to whom Adele could apply--Prince Savelli himself. She thought of him, last and wondered why she had not remembered him first. He was a man of, singular energy, courage, and coolness, whose chief fault was a tendency, to overestimate beyond all limits the importance of his family and the, glory of his ancient name. She knew that he was abnormally sensitive on, these points and that if she could rouse his ever ready pride, he would, hesitate at nothing in order to bring retribution upon any one rash, enough to insult or injure any member of his family. And he lived a life, of his own and cared little for the world. His passion, strangely, enough, was of a scientific kind. He was an astronomer, had built, himself an observatory on the top of the massive old palace, and spent, the greater part of his time there. Such existences, in the very heart, of society, are not unknown in Rome. Prince Savelli had remained what he, was by nature, a true student, and was perfectly happy in his own way\\n\\nevery hand is hidden to make the sign of defence; no one will speak to, him who can help it, and then always with concealed fingers kept rigidly, bent in the orthodox fashion, or clasped upon a charm of proved, efficacy. Few, indeed, are those brave enough to ask such a man to, dinner, and they are esteemed almost miraculously fortunate if no, misfortune befalls them during the succeeding four and twenty hours, if, their houses do not burn, and their children do not develop the measles., Incredible as it may appear to northern people, a man or woman may be, socially ruined by the imputation of \\\"projecting,\\\" when it is sustained, by the coinciding of the very smallest accident with their presence, or, with the mention of their names, and quite enough of such coincidences, were actually noted in Laura's case to make the reputation of being a, jettatrice cling to her for life. Ghisleri knew this, and his wrath was, kindled, and smouldered, and grew hot, till it was ready to burst out at, a moment's notice and do considerable damage.\\n\\nfor the sake of the persons concerned. It was very far from Maria B.'s, thoughts to degrade herself by setting a price upon the documents. If, Lady Herbert cared to possess them they should be hers, and any small, reward she might be willing to give would be humbly and thankfully, accepted. In order that she might judge of the nature of the letters in, question, Maria B. enclosed a copy of the one last written before the, transaction alluded to had been concluded. Lady Herbert would be able to, understand the names from the initials used by the copyist.\\n\\n\\\"The man should be tried, convicted, and sent to the galleys,\\\" said, Gerano. \\\"There can be no doubt of the justice of that, if all this can, be established in court. Remember I do not doubt my daughter's word, and, it would be monstrous to suppose that she has invented this story., Whatever the truth about it may be, it must be thoroughly investigated., But there may be a good deal of exaggeration about it, for I have known, Adele to over-state a case. There is a great difference between shutting, one's door on a man, or turning him out of his club, and bringing an, accusation against him which, if proved, will entail a term of penal, servitude. You see that, I am sure. Do you not think that we ought to go, and see Ghisleri together, tell him what we have learned, and ask him to, justify himself if he can?\\\"\\n\\nWhen he left the house, Arden drove to a certain studio, and then and, there bought a small picture which Laura had admired very much, and had, been two or three times to see. To the artist's surprise, he insisted, upon carrying it away with him at once, just as it was. Then he told the, coachman to drive to the Palazzo Savelli. He sent up his card and asked, to see Don Francesco, and at once received an answer, begging him to go, up stairs.\\n\\n\\\"You always take shelter behind assertions of that kind. I know it is of, no use to ask you to tell me the whole story, for if you were willing to, tell it, you would have told it to me already. No one can conceal fact, as you can and yet never be caught in a downright falsehood. Half an, hour ago, when we were sitting in that other room, you knew just as well, as you do now that you were to fight to-morrow, and you had not the, slightest intention of telling me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope you are right. If you are not my friend, who should be? So you, think I hate you. You are very wrong. I am still very fond of you. I, told you so the other day. You should believe me. Remember, when it all, ended, it was you who had changed--not I. I am not reproaching you. I, might say that you should have known yourself better than to think that, you could be faithful; but you might tell me--and it would be quite as, just--that I, a woman, knew what I was doing and had been taught to look, upon my deeds as you never could. But it was you who changed. If you had, loved me, I should have loved you still. Little things showed me long, ago that your love was waning. It was never what it was in those first, days. And now I have changed, too. I love what was once, but if I could, have your love now as it was at its strongest and best, I would not ask, for it. Why should I? I could never trust it again, and anything is, better than that doubt. And I want no consolation.\\\"\\n\\nand he had long been in the habit of throwing into a rough, impersonal, shape, the thoughts that crossed his mind about himself and others, when, he was alone at night. Being, as he very truly said, no poet, he quickly, tore up such odds and ends of halting rhyme or stumbling prose, either, as soon as they were written, or the next morning. Whatever the form of, these productions might be, the ideas they expressed were rarely feeble, and were indeed sometimes so strong that they might have even shocked, some unusually sensitive person in the gay set.\\n\\nand that might, some day, develop into real madness. She was sane enough, still, however, to suffer, and no such merciful termination to her, sufferings as the loss of her reason would be seemed at all imminent., The strong will and acute intelligence had survived, for the poisonous, drug she loved had attacked the body, which was the weaker portion of, her being. Adele was hopelessly paralysed. The last great effort had, been too much for the over-strung nerves. Her hands still moved, convulsively, but she could not direct them at all. Her jaw had dropped\\n\\nWe find no fault with Mr. Henry James's \\\"Princess Casamassima.\\\" It is a, great novel; it is his greatest, and it is incomparably the greatest, novel of the year in our language....

It made his blood sting to, think that a man who had been loved to the latest breath by such a woman, as Bianca should throw himself at the feet of Maddalena dell' Armi--not, to mention any of the others for whom Pietro had felt an ephemeral, passion during the last six years and more. And Pietro, on his side\\n\\nIn the natural course of events, social and domestic, it became, necessary to choose a husband for Adele so soon as she made her first, appearance in society. At that time Laura was not yet seventeen. Gerano, had already looked about him and had made up his mind. He was a little, dark-eyed man, grey, thin and nervous, but gifted with an unusually, agreeable manner, a pleasant tone of voice, a frank glance, and an, extremely upright character--a man much liked in the world and a good, deal respected.\\n\\n\\\"I know more of what you have done for me than you suppose,\\\" said Laura., \\\"Never mind that. The facts are simple enough. We are good friends; we, depend, for a certain amount of happiness, upon seeing one another, often; because the world does not understand, it expects us to sacrifice, our inclinations. For my part, I refuse. There is only one person to be, consulted--my mother, who is dearer to me than any friend can be. I will, speak to her and make her see the truth. In the mean time do nothing\\n\\nand to reflect upon his future conduct, before sending for Ubaldini and, consulting with him. He had almost expected the demand to restore a, document he did not possess, but he was not prepared for the, well-constructed story by which Savelli, Gerano, and their lawyer had, been persuaded of his guilt. The lawyer's words had placed the whole, affair in a light which showed how thoroughly convinced the three men, were of the justice of their accusation, and Ghisleri understood well, enough that Savelli intended to take legal steps. What those steps might, be, Pietro had not the least idea. He rang for Bonifazio and sent him, out to buy the Penal Code. It was probably the wisest thing he could do, under the circumstances, as he did not even know whether, if he were, arrested, he should be admitted to bail or not. He saw well enough that, an order for his arrest might very possibly be issued. Grondona was far, too grave and learned a lawyer to have uttered such a threat in vain\\n\\nOf course, her manner was greatly changed from what it had been. She, never laughed now, and rarely ever smiled, except when she held the, child in her arms. But there was nothing morbid nor brooding in her, gravity. She had accepted her lot and was determined to make the best of, it according to her light. In time she would grow more cheerful, and by, and by she would be her old self again--more womanly, perhaps, and, certainly more mature, but not materially altered in character or, disposition. The short months which had sufficed for what had hitherto, been the chief acts of her life had not been filled with violent or, conflicting emotions, and it is emotion more than anything else which, changes the natures of men and women for better or for worse. The love, that had been born of mingled pity and sympathy of thought had risen, quickly in the peaceful, remote places of her heart, and had flowed, smoothly through the sweet garden of her maidenly soul, unruffled and, undeviating, until it had suddenly disappeared into the abyss of, eternity. It had left no wreck and no ruin behind, no devastation and no, poisonous, stagnant pools, as some loves do. The soil over which it had, passed had been refreshed and made fertile by it, and would bear flowers, and fruit hereafter as fragrant and as sweet as it could ever have, borne; and at the last, in that one great moment of pain when she had, stood at the brink and seen all she loved plunge out of sight for ever, in the darkness, she had heard in her ear the tender cry of a new young, life calling to her to turn back and tend it, and love it, and show it, the paths that lead to such happiness as the world holds for the pure in, heart.\\n\\nLaura had never found much that was congenial in the city in which she, had been brought up as though it had been her birthplace. As for Arden, himself, he was too much accustomed to travelling from place to place to, prefer one city to another in any great degree. So the two were alone, together and desired nothing beyond what they had, which, perhaps, is, the ideal condition for lovers. To most people, however, the honeymoon, is a terrible trial--probably because most young couples are not very, desperately in love with each other. They wander aimlessly about in all, directions, a sort of joint sacrifice, perpetually tortured and daily, offered up on the altar of the diabolical courier, crushed beneath the, ubiquitous Juggernaut hotel-keeper, bound continually in new and arid, places to be torn by the vulture guide, and ultimately sent home more or, less penniless, quite temperless, and perhaps permanently disgusted with, one another and with married life. And yet the absurd farce is kept up\\n\\nMaddalena did not hesitate. She dressed herself in an old black frock, she found among her things, put on a thick veil, went out alone, and, drove to Pietro's lodgings. Such rash things may be done with impunity, in Paris or London, but they rarely remain long concealed in a small, city like Rome. He was still unconscious from weakness and loss of, blood. His eyes were half closed and his face was transparently white., Maddalena stood still at the foot of the bed and looked at him, while, the doctor and the nurse gazed at her in surprise. During what seemed an, endless time to them she did not move. Then she beckoned to the surgeon\\n\\nThey parted on very bad terms that day, and two or three days more, passed before they saw each other again. The Contessa had almost made up, her mind that she would not speak to San Giacinto at all, and Ghisleri, began to think that she wished to break with him permanently. Far more, sensitive than any one supposed, he had been deeply wounded by her words, and tone, so deeply indeed that he scarcely wished to meet her for the, present. The world did not fail to see the coldness that had come, between them, and laughed heartily over it. The Contessa, said the, world, thought that the way to keep Ghisleri was to be cold to him and, encourage Pietrasanta, but she did not know dear Ghisleri, who did not, care in the very least, who had not a particle of sensitiveness in him\\n\\nThen she told her story from beginning to end. She of course took, advantage of the fact that her father-in-law was but slightly acquainted, with Ghisleri to paint his character with the colours best suited to her, purpose, while asserting nothing about him which could be in direct, contradiction to the testimony of others. She spoke very lucidly and, connectedly, for she knew the lesson well and she was conscious that her, whole existence was at stake. One fault, one little error sufficient to, cast suspicion on her veracity, might be enough to ruin her in the end., She concluded by a well-turned and pathetic allusion to her state of, health, which indeed was pitiable enough. She knew that she was dying\\n\\ndo not think that is a phrase. I do not love you any more. Are you glad, to know it? I wish I did. But I am far too fond of you not to wish you, to be happy if you can. You are my dearest and best friend. It is, strange, is it not? Think of me kindly sometimes, in your new life., And--and do not speak my name before her, if you can help it. She knows, what we were to each other once, and it might hurt her.\\\"\\n\\nLaura had not yet returned, and he was glad, on the whole, that she was, away. Matters were evidently coming to a crisis, and he believed that, whatever was to happen would have long been over by the time she was in, Rome again. If she had already arrived he would have found it hard not, to tell her of what occurred from day to day, and, indeed, he would have, felt almost obliged to do so for the sake of her opinion of him, seeing, how frankly and loyally she had acted in the case of the letters she had, received from the supposititious \\\"Maria B.\\\" On the other hand, he longed, to see her for her own sake. The summer months had been desperately long, and lonely. He did not remember that he had ever found the time weigh so, heavily on his hands as this year, both at Torre de' Ghisleri and in, Rome. He forgot his present danger and the interview before him in, thinking of Laura Arden, when Bonifazio threw open the door and, announced Prince Savelli, the Prince of Gerano, and the Advocato, Geronimo Grondona.\\n\\nOn the following day the news was announced to the city and the world., The world held up its hands in wonder, and its tongue wagged for a whole, week and a few days more. Laura Carlyon was to marry a penniless cripple, of the most dissipated habits. How shocking! Of course every one knew, that Lord Herbert had not fainted at all on that night at the Palazzo, Braccio, but had succumbed, in the natural course of events, to the, effects of the champagne he had taken at dinner. That was now quite, certain. And the whole world was well aware that his father had cut him, off with a pittance on account of his evil ways, and that his brother, had twice paid his gambling debts to save the family name from disgrace., Englishmen as a race, and English cripples in particular, were given to, drink and high play. The man had actually been the worse for wine when, talking to Laura Carlyon in her mother's house, and Ghisleri had been, obliged to carry him out for decency's sake before anything worse, happened. Scandalous! It was a wonder that Ghisleri, who, after all, was, a gentleman, could associate with such a fellow. After all, nobody ever, liked Laura Carlyon since she had first appeared in society, soon after, dear Donna Adele's marriage. It was as well that she should go to, England and live with her tipsy cripple. She was good-looking, as some, people admitted. She might win the heart of her brother-in-law and, induce him to pay her husband's debts a third time. They were said to be, enormous.\\n\\nwhich strongly suggested the high predominance of all that was good over, the ordinary instincts of average human nature. He felt a sort of, reverence for her which he had never felt for any one; he knew that she, was good, he imagined that she was almost saintly in her life, and he, believed that she might, under certain circumstances become, in the best, religious sense, a holy woman. Had he seen her on that evening when, Arden had found her strangling an imaginary enemy in a fit of, exceedingly human anger, he could hardly have accepted the evidence of, his senses. All that was good in her appealed directly through all that, was bad in him to the small remnant of the better nature which had, survived through his misspent life. It did not, indeed, rouse in him the, slightest active desire to imitate her virtues. The very idea that he, could ever be virtuous in any sense, brought a smile to his face. But he, could not help admiring what he knew to be so very far beyond his, sphere--what he believed, perhaps, to be even further from his reach, than it actually was. He had reached that almost morbid stage of, self-contempt in which a man, while still admiring goodness in others\\n\\nBefore night he received a note from Laura Arden. She wrote that she had, seen him driving, though he had not seen her pass, as he had been, looking in the opposite direction. If he was able to bear the fatigue of, making a call, she begged that he would come to her at any hour he chose, to name, as she wished to speak to him. He answered at once that he, would be at her house on the following day at three o'clock.\\n\\nHe had hardly finished speaking when the door opened, and Donald, announced Don Francesco and Donna Adele Savelli. A very slight shadow, passed over Laura's face, as she rose to meet her step-sister, but, Ghisleri remained cold and impassive. Adele started perceptibly, as, Laura had done, when she saw him, and Ghisleri was struck by the change, in her own appearance. Her expression was that of a woman who is in, almost constant pain, and who has grown restless under it, and fears its, return at any moment. Her eyes turned uneasily, glancing about the room, in all directions, and avoiding the faces of those present. She was, pale, too, and looked altogether ill.\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" exclaimed the Marchesa, who had known the Princess of Sant', Ilario more than twenty years earlier. \\\"No one was ever so beautiful as, Corona. Laura is much shorter, too, and that makes a difference. Laura, reminds one of a saint, and Corona looked an empress--or what empresses, are supposed to be like. But Laura is a beautiful woman. There is no one, to compare with her now but Christina Campodonico, and she is too thin., What a good looking couple Ghisleri and his wife will make. He has grown, younger during the last two years.\\\"\\n\\nHe joined in the conversation during a few minutes longer, and then took, leave of the three. Formerly he would have gone to spend an hour or two, with Maddalena, but he had no inclination to do so now. He would gladly, have stayed with Laura if the Savelli couple had not come. He wished to, be alone, now, and to think over what he had done. It was the first time, that he had ever told the story of his love for Bianca Corleone to any, one, and calm as he had seemed while telling it, he had felt a very, strong emotion. He was glad to be at home again, alone with his own, thoughts, and with the picture that reminded him of the dead woman. He, knew that she would have forgiven him for speaking of her to-day as he, had spoken, and to such a woman as Laura Arden. For in his heart he, compared the two. There had been grand lines in Bianca Corleone's, character, as there were in that of her passionate brother, as Ghisleri, believed there must be in Laura Arden's also, and great generosities\\n\\nNevertheless, he was conscious of being surprised at the calmness of his, own repentance, as he called it rather contemptuously, and he wished, himself, as usual, quite different from what he was. And yet he had not, forgotten the semi-theatrical resolution to change his life, which he, had made on the night before the duel, still less had he any intention, of breaking it. He had always laughed at men and women who made sudden, and important resolutions under the influence of emotion, and, on the, whole, he had never seen any reason for looking upon such gratuitous, promises as valid, unless there had been witnesses to them, and human, vanity afterwards came into play. But now, in his own case, he meant to, try the experiment. It made no difference whether he were vain about it, or not, if he succeeded, nor, if he failed, whether he scorned his own, weakness a little more than before. No one would ever know, and since by, Laura Arden's rigid standard of right and wrong the end to be gained, belonged distinctly to the right, he would be in a measure following her, advice in regard to life in general. Deeper down in his nature, too\\n\\nand he has told me that unless some saint performs a miracle nothing can, save you at the trial. So that I must give my evidence. But if I do, the, Princess Adele will go to the galleys, and the house of Savelli will be, quite ruined. For the Princess murdered Lord Herbert Arden, and tried to, murder Donna Laura, as we call her. She invited them to dinner and gave, them napkins which she with her own hand had poisoned with infection of, the scarlet fever, her maid Lucia having had it at the time. And Lord, Herbert died within three days, but Donna Laura did not catch it. And I, have read how she did this, and many other wicked things, in a letter, written with her own hand. For it was I who found the confession they, speak of, when I went alone to look at the old prisons at Gerano, while, you and the signori were out driving. And now I do not know what to do\\n\\nAs she proceeded she watched the Prince's face, and she saw that she had, produced the right impression from the first. The plausibility of the, tale, as she told it, was undeniable, and might have shaken the belief, in Ghisleri's integrity in the minds of men who knew him far better than, the elder Savelli. As she had anticipated, the latter took up the, question as one deeply affecting the honour of his name. He was very, angry in his calm way, and his blue eyes flashed through his great, gold-rimmed spectacles, while his slender, energetic white hand clenched, itself and opened frequently upon his knee.\\n\\n\\\"Just as you went to get me the lemonade, I heard two people talking in, a low voice behind me,\\\" said Maddalena. \\\"They must have stopped first by, the door--I looked round afterwards and saw them, but I do not know, either of them--some new people from one of the other embassies, or, merely foreigners here on a visit. They spoke rather bad French. There, was a man and a lady. They saw you cross the room and the lady asked the, man who you were, and the man told her, saying that he only knew you by, sight. The lady uttered an exclamation, and said that you were the one, man in Rome whom she wished to see because you had been loved by--you, know whom I mean--I know it hurts you to speak of her, and I understand, it. The man laughed and said there had been others since, and that there, was especially a certain Marquise d' Armi, as he called me, who was, madly in love with you. The most amusing part of the whole thing\\n\\n\\\"I would rather you should not do that,\\\" she said at last. \\\"I may as, well tell you what I think about it. To me, and to you, it seems, thoroughly absurd that you should not see me whenever we choose to meet., There are many reasons why I should look upon you as a friend, and why, you should come more often than any other man I know. But the world, thinks differently. My mother has spoken to me about it more than once\\n\\nGhisleri grew even more careful of his speech after that. But he did not, see Laura often before she went away northward for the summer. The, spring was going fast, and the time was coming when Rome would be its, quiet old-fashioned self again for those few who loved it well enough to, face the heat of July and August. Almost every one was thinking of going, away. The Prince and Princess of Gerano were going out to the castle, earlier than usual, for the news of Adele grew steadily worse. Francesco, now had the doctor out regularly three times a week, and was forced to, lead an existence he detested. His wife was by this time quite unable to, get rest without taking very large quantities of chloral, and at times, her sufferings were such that it seemed almost advisable to give her, morphia. Every one, however, who brought intelligence from Gerano agreed, in saying that she did her best to keep up, and seemed to dread the idea, of an illness which might keep her permanently in her room. Whenever, she felt able she insisted on driving out and on going through the, regular round of monotonous country occupations. Her father and, step-mother therefore determined to go out and help Francesco to take, care of her, and make her existence as bearable as possible. Amongst all, her friends she was spoken of with the utmost compassion, and no one, ever suggested that her illness could proceed from any such cause as, Ghisleri believed to be at the root of it.\\n\\nThe servant returned as he finished, and handed his master the little, yellow-covered volume with an expression of inquiry on his face., Ghisleri looked at him and hesitated, debating whether it would be wise, to warn the man of what might take place at any moment. There was much, friendliness in the relations between the two. Bonifazio had been with, Pietro many years and perhaps understood the latter's character better, than any one. The servant was almost as unlike other people, in his own, way, as Ghisleri himself, and was in two respects a remarkable contrast, to him. He was imperturbably good-tempered in the first place, and, in, the second, he was extremely devout. But there were resemblances also\\n\\nWhile making the most desperate attempts to control herself, Adele was, in a state of the wildest and most conflicting emotion. Her strength, returned, indeed, in a certain measure after a few hours, but her, distress seemed rather to increase than to diminish, when she was able, to walk about the room and submit to being dressed. Her maid irritated, her unaccountably, too, and at last, giving way to the impulse she had, felt so long, she told her that she must go at the end of the month.\\n\\nThey had scarcely sat down and he could see that Ghisleri was beginning, to talk, when Anastase Gouache appeared and stood still before them. To, Arden's surprise the Contessa welcomed him with a bright smile and, pointed to a chair at her side of the sofa. Anastase Gouache was a, celebrated painter who had married a Roman lady of high birth, and was a, very agreeable man, but Arden had not expected that he would be invited, so readily to interrupt so promising a conversation. Ghisleri's face, expressed nothing. He appeared to join in the talk for a few minutes and, then rose and left the Contessa with Gouache. She looked after him, and, Arden thought she grew a shade paler and frowned. A faint smile appeared, on the Englishman's face and was gone again in an instant as Ghisleri, came near him, returning again to the ball-room. Ghisleri had glanced at, him as he passed and had seen that he was not talking to a lady.\\n\\nand reticent in the highest degree. That such an otherwise perfect, creature should have defects was only to be expected. Bonifazio was as, obstinate as flint when he had made up his mind as to how any particular, thing was to be done. He was silently officious, in his anxiety to be, always ready to fulfil his master's wishes, and often annoyed him in, small ways by thrusting services upon him which he did not require. On, rare occasions he would insist upon giving very useless and uncalled-for, advice.\\n\\nSo the dinner passed off admirably--so well, indeed, that when all were, going home, Laura and her mother looked at one another as though they, could hardly believe what they had seen and heard. The Princess of, Gerano began to doubt the truth of the accusations against Adele, and, even Laura fancied that they must have been very much exaggerated. The, Prince, himself, the only one of the party who had heard the slander, from Adele's own lips, sentence by sentence, and almost word for word as, Ghisleri had repeated it to him, wisely held his peace, while by no, means so wisely believing that his daughter had repented and was, carrying out his instructions in all sincerity. He kissed her, affectionately on the forehead when he went away, and she felt that she, had won a victory.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he ascertained that Laura was likely to be hampered for ready, money. Her mother's private resources were very slender, and Laura was, far too proud to accept any assistance from Adele Savelli's father. She, could not dispose, as a matter of fact, of anything which her husband, had left her except the actual ready money which happened to be in the, house; for she could not even draw upon his letters of credit until the, will was proved and the legal formalities all carried out. It was, natural, too, that at such a time she should neither be aware of her, position nor give a thought to such a trivial matter as household, expenses.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, she behaved with a courage and determination, admirable in themselves. Few women could have borne the constant strain, upon the faculties at all, still fewer after such illness as she had, suffered. But she was really very strong, though everything which, affected her feelings and thoughts reacted upon her physical nature as, such things never can in less nervously organised constitutions. She, bore the excruciating anxiety about the lost confession better than the, shadowy fear of the supernatural which still haunted her in the hours of, the night. On the third day she begged her husband to increase the dose, of chloral by a very small quantity, saying that if only she could sleep, well for a whole week she would then be so much better as to be able to, give it up altogether. Savelli hesitated, and at last consented. Since, she had seemed so much more quiet he dreaded a return of her former, state, for he was a man who loved his ease and hated everything which, disturbed it.\\n\\nThey continued to talk upon indifferent subjects. At dinner Pietro took, much pains to be agreeable, and succeeded admirably, for he was well, able to converse pleasantly when he chose. Though extremely tired, he, sat up till nearly midnight talking politics with Savelli, as Adele had, foreseen, and when he was at last shown to his distant room by, Bonifazio, who had spent most of his day in studying the topography of, the castle, he was very nearly exhausted.\\n\\nand somewhat novel, so that every one was delighted. As a matter of, fact, the Count did not care a straw for his wife, rarely saw her at, all, and then only to discuss the weather. He had married her in order, that her fortune might help him in his political career, he had got what, he wanted, and he was supremely indifferent to the rest. The sad part of, the matter was--if any one had known the truth--that poor Maddalena, dell' Armi had been married out of a convent, and had then and there, fallen madly in love with him, her own husband. He had resented her, excessive affection, as it interfered with his occupations and, amusements, and after an interval of five years, during which the, unhappy young wife shed endless tears and suffered intensely, he had the, satisfaction of seeing that she no longer loved him in the least, and, rather avoided him than otherwise. In taking a fancy to Pietro Ghisleri, he thought she had shown considerable discrimination, since every one, knew that Ghisleri was a very discreet man. The amazing cynicism of his, view altogether escaped him. He was occupied in politics. If he had, observed it, he would have undoubtedly laughed as heartily as he did, when a lady on the outskirts of society told him that he was supposed to, be a jealous husband.\\n\\nThat night, in despair, she swallowed a larger dose of sulphonal than, she had ever taken before. The consequence was that towards two o'clock, she fell asleep and seemed more quiet than usual, as the nurse watched, her. An hour passed without her waking, then another, and then the dawn, stole through the panes of the deep windows, and daylight came at last., The room was quite light, and Adele was generally awake at that hour., But this morning she slept on. The nurse was accustomed to take away, the lamps as soon as Adele needed them no longer, not extinguishing them, in the room on account of the disagreeable smell they made. It chanced, on this occasion--or fate had decreed it--that one of these gave signs, of going out. The nurse rose very softly and took it away, moving, noiselessly in her felt slippers, passing through the open door of the, dressing-room in order to reach the corridor in which the lamps were, left to be taken and cleaned at a later hour. She set the one she, carried upon a deal table which stood there, and tried to put it out, so, as to leave no part of the wick still smouldering, lest it should smoke., She was a very careful and methodical woman, and took pains to be neat, in doing the smallest things. Just now, too, she was in no hurry, for it, was broad daylight, and Adele would not be nervous if she awoke and, found herself alone.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid not. Even my lawyer thinks that your testimony would not, help me much. After all, you know what happened. I told you that I was, innocent, and you believed me. Or, if you please, you believed me, innocent before I said I was. There is only your belief or my word to, fall back upon, and neither would prove anything in court. Ubaldini says, so. I really expect to be convicted, and I will bear it as well as I, can. I will certainly not do anything to escape from it all.\\\" He had, hesitated as he reached the last words, but he saw that Laura, understood.\\n\\nand that she herself expected no return of it. That alone was enough to, change his whole existence in the present, and in the immediate future., Then, too, he felt that he had at least settled old scores with, Campodonico and had in a measure expiated one, at least, of his past, misdeeds, almost at the cost of his life. Morally speaking, too, he had, kept his oath to Bianca Corleone, for under the utmost provocation he, had refused to fight in the old quarrel, and even when driven to bay and, forced upon new ground by Campodonico's implacable hatred, he had stood, up to be killed without so much as firing at Bianca's brother. There, was a deep and real satisfaction in that, and he was perhaps too ill as, yet to torture himself by stigmatising it as a bit of vanity. The world, might think what it pleased. Maddalena might misjudge his motives, and, Gianforte might triumph in his victory--it all made no difference to, him. He was conscious that to the best of his ability he had acted, according to the dictates of true honour, as he understood it; and at, night he closed his eyes and fell peacefully asleep, and in the morning, he opened them quietly again upon the little world of his invalid's, surroundings.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, unless a man is very rich. Bring a suit against his title, and, if he fights it, the lawyers will eat up all he has. Then you can play, the magnanimous part and say that you give up the suit out of pity for, him. That is very pretty, too. But the prettiest of all is the new way, of killing people, because nobody can possibly find you out.\\\"\\n\\nBut now a change had come. For the first time in years, he knew that if, the choice were suddenly offered him at the present moment he would, choose to live out all the days allotted to him, and would wish that, they might be many rather than few. There was, indeed, a dark spot on, the page last turned, of which he could never efface the memory, nor, in, his own estimation, outlive the shame. In his day-dreams Maddalena dell', Armi's coldly perfect face was often before him with an expression upon, it which he feared to see, knowing too well why it was there--and out of, a deeper depth of memory dead Bianca Corleone's eyes looked at him with, reproach and sometimes with scorn. There was much pain in store for him, yet, of the kind at which the world never guessed, nor ever could. But, he would not try to escape from it. He would not again so act or think, as to call himself coward in his own heart's tribunal.\\n\\n\\\"MY DEAR SIGNOR GHISLERI:--I care for the world and its opinion much,     less than you do for my sake, or than you suppose I do for myself. I,     mean to see you, and to have it known that I see you, and I will. If,     you are not here to-morrow at precisely one o'clock I will go to,     your lodgings and wait for you if you are out. People may say what,     they please.\\n\\nshe should be kept in ignorance of what was occurring. Having decided, this point, he began to think of choosing some person to whom, if he, were actually arrested, he might apply for assistance in the matter of, obtaining bail. There was no time to be lost, as he was well aware., Since Savelli really believed him guilty of the abominable crime with, which he was charged, it was not likely that time would be given him to, leave the country, as his adversaries would naturally expect that he, would attempt to do. They had probably gone straight from his lodging to, the office of the chief of police,--the questore, as he is called in, Italy,--and if they succeeded, as in all likelihood they would, in, getting a warrant for his arrest, he might expect the warrant to be, executed at any moment during the day. It was extremely important that, he should be prepared for the worst. He thought of all the men he knew\\n\\nFaithful and devoted in every way, he wholly disapproved, on religious, grounds, of Ghisleri's mode of life, even so far as he was acquainted, with it. He considered that Pietro lived and had lived for many years in, seven-fold deadly sin, and he daily offered up the most sincere prayers, for Pietro's repentance and reformation. Twice a year, also, he, privately presented the parish priest with a small charity out of his, savings, requesting him to say a mass for Ghisleri's benefit. Obstinate, in this as in everything else, he firmly believed that his master's soul, might ultimately be saved by sheer prayer-power, so to say.\\n\\nLaura read aloud a great deal in the intervals of conversation, and the, days passed almost too quickly. The vessel was a large steam-yacht, of, the modern type, comfortable in the extreme, and capable of, accommodating a large party--for two persons it was almost palatial., Whatever the weather, cool or hot, rainy or dry, rough or fair, there, was always a place where they could install themselves in the morning or, the afternoon, and talk and read to their hearts' content. They had no, fixed plan either in their wanderings, but went where their fancy took, them, to Palermo, to Messina, to Syracuse. They sat together in the vast, ruined theatre above magic Taormina, and gazed on the sunlit sea and, Etna's snowy crest. They went to Malta, they drove, side by side\\n\\nBut she did not answer, as she sank into a chair before the table, and, almost mechanically dipped a pen into the ink. San Giacinto laid the, formal denial before her, holding the confession behind him, for he, believed her capable of snatching it from him and tossing it into the, fire at any moment. She signed painfully in large, sloping characters, that decreased rapidly in size at the end of each of her two names. The, pen fell from her hand as she finished, and San Giacinto quietly laid, the sealed letter before her. If she had been on the point of fainting\\n\\nNow Padre Bonaventura of the Minor Order of St. Francis was Adele's, confessor in Rome. After the long struggle which Lucia had watched, through the door, Adele's conscience had got the upper hand, aided by, the belief that in following its dictates she would be doing the best, she could towards recovering her peace of mind. Not being willing to go, to the parish priest of Gerano, who had known her and all her family, from her childhood, and who was by no means a man able to give very wise, advice in difficult cases, and being, moreover, afraid of rousing her, husband's suspicions if she insisted upon going to Rome merely to, confess, she had written out a most careful confession of those sins of, which she accused herself, and, as is allowable in extreme cases, had, sent it by post to Padre Bonaventura.\\n\\nbeautiful, good Laura Arden for his wife, especially since she was so, immensely rich? Doubt the justice of Heaven after that, if you could! As, for the world, it meant to tell them both how sorry it was that it had, misunderstood them. Of course it would be sinful not to hope that Adele, might some day get well, but she had her deserts, and if she ever came, back to society, people would not care to meet her. She might go mad, again at any moment and try to ruin some one else, and might succeed the, next time, too.\\n\\nAdele turned pale and leaned against the wall, breathing hard. If Lucia, had acted differently she might have been suspected of having told a, falsehood, and of keeping the letter back in order to extort a larger, sum for it at some future time. But Lucia had evidently been frightened., Moreover, the woman was undoubtedly ignorant of the existence of the, well under the stone, or, she would never have been so foolish as to, choose such a place for hiding anything so valuable, and it was clear, that she had no idea of the manner in which the package had disappeared., That it must have reached the bottom, Adele was quite sure. In that case, some one had been in the dungeon before her and had picked it up, but, who the some one might be she had no means of conjecturing.\\n\\nconsidering what she knew. She suspected some new and tortuous, development of his character, and would have instinctively drawn back, from the intimacy she felt was growing up between him and herself, had, she not by experience found out that she might be quite wrong about him, after all. She tried, at the present juncture, to shake off the, sensation which was now far more distasteful to her than it had formerly, been, in proportion as she had fancied that she understood him better., But she could not altogether succeed. It was too strange, in her, opinion, that he should willingly be Adele's guest, and put himself, under even a slight obligation to her. It showed, she thought, how, individual views could differ in regard to friendship. She was even, rather surprised to find that she was asking herself whether, if, Gianforte and Christina Campodonico possessed a habitable castle and, invited her to stop with them, she would accept, considering that, Gianforte had almost killed her husband's best friend. She, unhesitatingly decided that she would not, and resented Ghisleri's, willingness to receive hospitality from one who, as he well knew, had, foully slandered both Arden and herself. Her doubts were certainly, justifiable to a certain extent. But there was no immediate probability, that they would be cleared away for the present. Ghisleri understood her, perfectly, and wondered whether he were not risking too much in, endangering a friendship so precious to him for the sake of following, out a suspicion which might, in the end, prove to have been altogether, without foundation. On the other hand, his natural obstinacy of purpose, when once called into play was such as not to leave the smallest, hesitation in his mind between doing what he had determined to do, or, not doing it, when he had once made up his mind, irrespective of, consequences. Having lost sight of the virtue of constancy, he clung to, a vicious obstinacy as a substitute.\\n\\nThe huge, giant strength of the man was imposing in itself, apart from, the terribly determined look of the iron features and deep-set eyes. Few, men would have cared to find themselves opposed to San Giacinto even, when he was perfectly calm, hardly any, perhaps, if his anger was, roused. The last time he had been angry had been when he dragged the, forger, Arnoldo Meschini, from the library to the study in Palazzo, Montevarchi more than twenty years earlier. His hair was turning grey, now, but there were no outward signs of any diminution in his powers\\n\\n, Pietro at once realised the situation and the meaning of the look he, saw. Something was passing in his old enemy's mind which had passed, through his own while he was looking at the picture, for Campodonico and, Ghisleri were both thinking of the extraordinary resemblance between, poor Bianca Corleone and the Tamara of Zichy's painting. That, resemblance, striking in a high degree, was the reason why Ghisleri, liked it, and had a photograph of it at his lodging. He regretted now, that he should have been so tactless as to stand long before it when, Campodonico was in the room. It was too late, however, and there was, nothing to be done but to meet the man's angry look quietly, and go, away. It was unfortunate that there should have been any discussion, between them at dinner, too, for Campodonico, as his wife said, was, hot-tempered in the extreme, and Ghisleri, though outwardly calm, had, always been liable to outbreaks of dangerous anger. There was, indeed\\n\\nThe tone this time, was, if possible, more humble and piteous than, before. After enumerating and discanting upon the horrible sufferings, the family underwent, and declaring that unless some charitable, Christian would give assistance in some shape, even were it but a loaf, of bread, the whole household must inevitably perish, and after adding, that father, mother, and all four children--the latter of tender, age--expected to be turned into the street by a hard-hearted landlord\\n\\nShe might have been proud to shed them, for they showed how much more, she loved her husband than she cared for herself, but she was conscious, only of the intense desire to face Adele, and do her some grievous, bodily hurt and be revenged for the foul slander cast on Herbert Arden., She opened and shut her hands convulsively, as though she were clutching, some one and strangling the breath in a living throat. Every drop of, blood in her young body was fire, every tear that rolled down her pale, cheek was molten lead, every beat of her angry pulse brought an angry, thought to her brain. How long she remained in this state she did not, know.\\n\\nand after a little hesitation he decided that he would write to San, Giacinto. The latter had always been friendly to him, and Pietro, remembered how he had spoken at the club, years ago, when Pietrasanta, was gossiping about Arden's supposed intemperance. San Giacinto's very, great moral weight in the world, due in different degrees to his, character, his superior judgment, and his enormous wealth, made him the, most desirable of allies. While he was waiting for Bonifazio's return\\n\\n, As Ghisleri had anticipated, Adele kept up a lively correspondence with, him for some time. All her letters were duly filed by Ubaldini, who took, certified copies of Pietro's replies, but did not mention what he, himself had done in the matter. Adele bargained sharply until Ghisleri, wrote to her as plainly as he well could that the manuscript was not to, be had for less than the sum he had repeatedly named, and that he could, do nothing more for her. Thereupon she answered that she would consider, the matter, and did not write again. Pietro, after waiting several days\\n\\nTo break my own if I lose you--Lose you? No--do not start.,     You angel--you bitter-sweet creature of heaven, I love you and hate,       you!,     For I know what you are, and I know that my sin cannot mate you.,     I know you are better than I--by the blessing of God!--,     And I hate what is better than I by the blessing of God!,     What right has the Being Magnificent, reigning supreme\\n\\nShe and Francesco reached the castle in the afternoon of the day, following their visit to Laura Arden. The weather was fine and the, westering sun streamed through the broad windows and lent everything a, passing air of life and almost of gaiety. During the first hours, Adele, felt that she must soon be better, and that she could find some rest at, last in the atmosphere which recalled her childish days and all her, peaceful girlhood.\\n\\nNearly a month had passed when Ghisleri was at last admitted to see, Laura. He found her lying upon the same sofa on which she had slept a, few hours during the memorable night before her husband died. She was, even thinner now, he thought, and her eyes seemed to be set deeper than, ever, while her face was almost transparent in its pallor. But the look, was different--it was that of a person growing stronger rather than of, one breaking down under a heavy strain. She held out her hand to him and, looked up with a faint smile as he came to her side. The greeting was, not a very cordial one, and Ghisleri felt a slight shock as he realised, the fact.\\n\\n\\\"Then remember it. Be sure of what you mean and of yourself, if you, can,--be quite, quite sure. You know what it would mean to me to break., I have not even a little child to love me, as Laura Arden has. I shall, have nothing when you are gone--nothing but the memory of all the wrong, I have done, all that can never be undone in this world or the next.\\\"\\n\\nlike an anapaest--and the sharp click of the stick between. She tried to, look behind her, but her blood froze in her veins, and she could not, move. Every instant increased her agony of fear. A moment more and, Herbert Arden would be upon her. Suddenly a second echo, that of, Francesco Savelli's firm, quick step reached her ears. Then she heard, voices, and as the curtain was lifted she recognised the tones of old, Giacomo, the lame warder, who had met her husband in the passage, and, was asking for the orders to be given to the carter who started for, Rome every other night and brought back such provisions as could not be, obtained in Gerano.\\n\\nHe stood at his open window early in the morning, and gazed out at the, fresh, bright country. The delicate hand of spring had already touched, the world with colour, and the breath of the coming warmth had waked the, life in all those things which die yearly, and are yearly raised again., Ghisleri felt the morning sun upon his thin, pale face, and he realised, that he also had been very near to death during the dark months, and he, remembered how he had wished that he might be not near only to dying\",\n          \"\\u201cI know he got a promise from Clarice to obey,\\u201d he thought. \\u201cI saw how, the image held her in its power. But that is as far as I have been able, to go. I may even be wrong in supposing the girl will come to-night. But, I think not. Let me see, they are all going to a ball to-night, Bentham, told me. That means they will leave home about eleven o\\u2019clock. It isn\\u2019t, ten yet. Can it be possible that she would come here first?\\u201d\\n\\nSeveral times in the past attempts had been made to wrest the district, leadership from him, but in all those cases his opponents had been so, weak, and their campaigns so poorly organized, that he had been able to, defeat them without much effort. The Honorable Sugden Lawrence, he had, reason to believe, would prove a much more formidable foeman. The, ex-judge possessed a personality which made him an opponent to be feared, even by so powerful a boss as Samuel J. Coggswell. Therefore the latter, had spoken with the utmost sincerity when he told Jake Hines that he, would miss him. He feared that in order to win, much dirty work would, have to be done; and Boss Coggswell disliked dirty work--when he had to, do it himself. It would have been so much pleasanter to have the, indefatigable Jake on hand to take care of the hiring of \\u201cguerrillas,\\u201d, the \\u201cfixing\\u201d of election inspectors, and various other details of a, similarly sordid and disagreeable character which Jake had always taken, care of so faithfully.\\n\\n\\u201cNow is the time,\\u201d thought Patsy. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do what he says about going, behind this big brass dub of an idol. But, first of all, I\\u2019ve got a, little private business of my own to pull off. I didn\\u2019t see anybody in, the kitchen when I came through. I hope it will be the same now. If it, isn\\u2019t---- Well, the chief said I wasn\\u2019t to mind getting into a scrap, when it was forced on me. I\\u2019d just like to land on that black guy who, let me in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t want to be recognized, eh?\\u201d smiled Bentham. \\u201cWhy? You don\\u2019t think, there will be anybody there who would be afraid of you as Nicholas, Carter, the detective, do you? Ched Ramar is a man who moves in the, highest circles and is known all over India. His house, in Brooklyn, Heights, is one that questionable characters would find it hard to, enter. He has two tall men of his own race perpetually on guard at his, door--besides many other servants engaged in this country.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019ll stay till I\\u2019ve looked at all of them. I hope you won\\u2019t think, I\\u2019m a coward. When I said I was afraid I meant that I felt a sort of, awe. I should think most persons would experience some such feeling on, beholding all these strange figures for the first time. No doubt, if I, lived in Tibet, or wherever these images come from, I should regard them, only with reverence, and believe in them as sacred guardians, like the, others who have been familiar with them from childhood.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d answered Dallas, \\u201cwhen the letter carrier opened the box and took, out the mail, and I caught sight of that square, pink envelope lying on, top of the heap, I jumped to the conclusion that it was mine, and I, grabbed it and hurried away, fearing that he might change his mind about, giving it to me. You see, Owen, I was very much excited. The letter, which I had received from my scapegrace brother that day was very, startling. It informed me that he was in great trouble, and was about to, do something desperate--the letter didn\\u2019t state what--and that the only, thing which could prevent him from taking this step was my coming to, Chicago immediately. It warned me, too, that I mustn\\u2019t let a soul in New, York know where I was going.\\u201d\\n\\nJust as the train which was to carry him off to prison was about to pull, out of the station, Jake received a visit from the man in whom he had, such faith. Coggswell rarely yielded to sentiment when it was against, his interest to do so, but in this instance, although he realized that, he could ill afford to be seen shaking hands with the convicted man, he, decided that the latter\\u2019s loyalty in refusing to \\u201csqueal\\u201d was deserving, of this tribute; so he was there to say farewell to his faithful, henchman.\\n\\nThe figure reached almost from floor to ceiling, so that the sapphire, was very high. If one wished to look at the jewel at close range--and, most persons who entered this room did want to do so--he had to climb a, small stepladder which stood conveniently at one side. Nick saw the girl, looking at this ladder, and he was about to make his presence known so, that he could move it for her, when she carried it over herself to the, front of the image and placed it firmly for use.\\n\\nProfessor Botkins tells of a remarkable instance of intelligence, exhibited by a garden toad. He was watching the efforts of his pet toad, to capture a very large worm. The toad had been sitting still, and, giving no sign that it saw anything. The worm gave a little wriggle as, it began to come out of the ground, when, quick as a flash the toad made, a leap, and seized the end of the worm in its mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cAn employment agency in New York. He had been a valet for a theatrical, man before he came to me. But he didn\\u2019t like traveling, and he was, willing to do the menial work I require rather than go on the road, again. He wanted to stay in New York, so that he could study more, conveniently. He is a bright chap, and he speaks German and French, as, well as English and his own native tongue.\\u201d\\n\\nChester Tupper, of Paternos, Wash., was riding through the orchard of C., J. Stiner in pursuit of some cattle, when his horse broke through a, hidden well, which had been dug to a depth of sixty feet and then, covered with loose boards. Tupper threw himself clear of the saddle and, saved himself. The horse went down, but somehow managed to keep his head, above the water. A tripod was rigged with pulley and snatch block. A, team was hitched to this and the horse was brought safely to the, surface.\\n\\nHe came back to Whitewater, and all went well for a dozen years. Last, week Mr. Williams began to complain of headaches, and on Tuesday started, for Janesville on some legal business. He disappeared exactly as he had, twenty years ago. And the strange display of his dual personality was, that he immediately went to Merriville, Ind., and tried to get work at, the same farm where he was found after his first disappearance.\\n\\n\\u201cHe has proved an alibi--without trying to do so. He mentioned that he, was visiting a fellow countryman of his who is employed at Yonkers, and, that he did not get home till two o\\u2019clock this morning. This friend of, his is in the service of a friend of mine, and I had him on the, telephone just before I came out this afternoon. Swagara did not leave, the house in Yonkers till one o\\u2019clock. He and his chum sat in the, kitchen, talking till that hour. My friend happened to have company\\n\\n\\u201cThe greatest tragedy is that, while under the dominion of another\\u2019s, will, the hypnotic subject has no realization of its doings, and, when, consciousness returns, no remembrance. Well, if Ched Ramar is taking, advantage of that young girl\\u2019s innocence of the ways of the world to, make her do things she would shrink from under ordinary circumstances, I, don\\u2019t think it will be well for Ched Ramar. In fact---- Hello! What\\u2019s, the trouble now? Here comes Chick!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhile Chick is talking to Swagara, will you have the cook and Mary up, here? I should like to question them in the presence of each other. No,\\u201d, continued Nick, with a smile, as he saw a peculiar expression in Matthew, Bentham\\u2019s face, \\u201cit isn\\u2019t that I want them to contradict each other, and, so prove that they are not telling the truth. In their nervousness they, are likely to tell different stories. My object is to get at the exact, truth by letting one remind the other of details she may have forgotten., I believe both those young women are honest.\\u201d\\n\\nand I was awfully scared. But I didn\\u2019t very well see how I could get out, to him, because\\u201d--she hesitated, and blushed painfully--\\u201cbecause I--I, didn\\u2019t have the fare, Owen. I had been sending more than I could spare, to Chester recently, to help him to get out of a scrape, and I was very, hard up. So I had to write him that I was very sorry, but I really, couldn\\u2019t come to Chicago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, indeed,\\u201d replied Bentham, with a slight smile, as he shook his, head. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t suppose I should receive the head of the Yellow Tong in, my house without knowing who he was? This Professor Ning Po--or whatever, his name was--did not look the kind of man to be connected with such an, infamous organization. He was a very mild sort of man, blinking behind, large spectacles, and a decidedly entertaining personage.\\u201d\\n\\n, The young politician took his medicine with a stoicism worthy of a, better cause. There was actually a broad grin on his beefy face as he, heard the judge utter the words which condemned him to several years, behind prison bars. But it was not wholly stoicism. His attitude was, partly due to the fact that even at that desperate stage of the game he, had not quite lost faith in the power of his master and mentor to aid, him.\\n\\n1--The Man from Nowhere., 2--The Face at the Window., 3--A Fight for a Million., 4--Nick Carter\\u2019s Land Office., 5--Nick Carter and the Professor., 6--Nick Carter as a Mill Hand., 7--A Single Clew., 8--The Emerald Snake., 9--The Currie Outfit., 10--Nick Carter and the Kidnaped Heiress., 11--Nick Carter Strikes Oil., 12--Nick Carter\\u2019s Hunt for a Treasure., 13--A Mystery of the Highway., 14--The Silent Passenger., 15--Jack Dreen\\u2019s Secret., 16--Nick Carter\\u2019s Pipe Line Case., 17--Nick Carter and the Gold Thieves., 18--Nick Carter\\u2019s Auto Chase., 19--The Corrigan Inheritance., 20--The Keen Eye of Denton., 21--The Spider\\u2019s Parlor., 22--Nick Carter\\u2019s Quick Guess., 23--Nick Carter and the Murderess., 24--Nick Carter and the Pay Car., 25--The Stolen Antique., 26--The Crook League., 27--An English Cracksman., 28--Nick Carter\\u2019s Still Hunt., 29--Nick Carter\\u2019s Electric Shock., 30--Nick Carter and the Stolen Duchess., 31--The Purple Spot., 32--The Stolen Groom., 33--The Inverted Cross., 34--Nick Carter and Keno McCall., 35--Nick Carter\\u2019s Death Trap., 36--Nick Carter\\u2019s Siamese Puzzle., 37--The Man Outside., 38--The Death Chamber., 39--The Wind and the Wire., 40--Nick Carter\\u2019s Three Cornered Chase., 41--Dazaar, the Arch-Fiend., 42--The Queen of the Seven., 43--Crossed Wires., 44--A Crimson Clew., 45--The Third Man., 46--The Sign of the Dagger., 47--The Devil Worshipers., 48--The Cross of Daggers., 49--At Risk of Life., 50--The Deeper Game., 51--The Code Message., 52--The Last of the Seven., 53--Ten-Ichi, the Wonderful., 54--The Secret Order of Associated Crooks., 55--The Golden Hair Clew., 56--Back From the Dead., 57--Through Dark Ways., 58--When Aces Were Trumps., 59--The Gambler\\u2019s Last Hand., 60--The Murder at Linden Fells., 61--A Game for Millions., 62--Under Cover., 63--The Last Call., 64--Mercedes Danton\\u2019s Double., 65--The Millionaire\\u2019s Nemesis., 66--A Princess of the Underworld., 67--The Crook\\u2019s Blind., 68--The Fatal Hour., 69--Blood Money., 70--A Queen of Her Kind., 71--Isabel Benton\\u2019s Trump Card., 72--A Princess of Hades., 73--A Prince of Plotters., 74--The Crook\\u2019s Double., 75--For Life and Honor., 76--A Compact With Dazaar., 77--In the Shadow of Dazaar., 78--The Crime of a Money King., 79--Birds of Prey., 80--The Unknown Dead., 81--The Severed Hand., 82--The Terrible Game of Millions., 83--A Dead Man\\u2019s Power., 84--The Secrets of an Old House., 85--The Wolf Within., 86--The Yellow Coupon., 87--In the Toils., 88--The Stolen Radium., 89--A Crime in Paradise., 90--Behind Prison Bars., 91--The Blind Man\\u2019s Daughter., 92--On the Brink of Ruin., 93--Letter of Fire., 94--The $100,000 Kiss., 95--Outlaws of the Militia., 96--The Opium-Runners., 97--In Record Time., 98--The Wag-Nuk Clew., 99--The Middle Link., 100--The Crystal Maze., 101--A New Serpent in Eden., 102--The Auburn Sensation., 103--A Dying Chance., 104--The Gargoni Girdle., 105--Twice in Jeopardy., 106--The Ghost Launch., 107--Up in the Air., 108--The Girl Prisoner., 109--The Red Plague., 110--The Arson Trust., 111--The King of the Firebugs., 112--\\u201cLifter\\u2019s\\u201d of the Lofts., 113--French Jimmie and His Forty Thieves., 114--The Death Plot., 115--The Evil Formula., 116--The Blue Button., 117--The Deadly Parallel., 118--The Vivisectionists., 119--The Stolen Brain., 120--An Uncanny Revenge., 121--The Call of Death., 122--The Suicide., 123--Half a Million Ransom., 124--The Girl Kidnaper., 125--The Pirate Yacht., 126--The Crime of the White Hand., 127--Found in the Jungle., 128--Six Men in a Loop., 129--The Jewels of Wat Chang., 130--The Crime in the Tower., 131--The Fatal Message., 132--Broken Bars., 133--Won by Magic., 134--The Secret of Shangore., 135--Straight to the Goal., 136--The Man They Held Back., 137--The Seal of Gijon., 138--The Traitors of the Tropics., 139--The Pressing Peril., 140--The Melting-Pot., 141--The Duplicate Night., 142--The Edge of a Crime., 143--The Sultan\\u2019s Pearls., 144--The Clew of the White Collar.\\n\\nWhat worried Boss Coggswell most of all was the fear that he would not, be able to carry out successfully on election day the corrupt practices, which now constituted his only hope of winning. That he could not win by, fair means he was already sadly convinced, but he hoped to be able to, steal the election by the aid of the guerrilla bands of \\u201crepeaters,\\u201d, fraudulent election inspectors, and stuffed ballot boxes.\\n\\n\\u201cMay I take the liberty, my dear judge, of congratulating you upon,      the satisfactory outcome of this unpleasant case, and upon the rare,      good sense you have displayed in deciding to settle the matter out,      of court, thereby avoiding a lot of painful notoriety, which, no,      doubt, would have been most distressing to a man as prominent in,      public life as yourself? We need scarcely assure you, now, that,      there will be absolutely no publicity.

Of this, number only sixty-seven were equipped with lightning rods. So far as, could be learned, about thirty-one per cent of the buildings insured by, these companies were rodded; hence, if the rods had furnished no, protection, the number of rodded buildings struck should have been five, hundred and seventy-two instead of sixty-seven.\\n\\n\\u201cSay!\\u201d exclaimed Patsy, with a chuckle, as Nick Carter brought a box of, grease paints, with boxes of powder, puffs, and bits of soft chamois, leather and put them on the table in front of him. \\u201cThis is the easiest, thing I have had for six months. Can I look like this Jap? Well, when I, get through, he\\u2019ll think _he\\u2019s_ Patsy Garvan, and he\\u2019ll be asking me, when I got in from Tokyo.\\u201d\\n\\nOne of the most active prospectors and mine operators in the extensive, zinc-mining district of southwest Missouri is a woman, Mrs. Sarah, Matlock. There is much activity in the Wentworth district, where her, interests are located, and she is carrying on operations on a big scale., One of her many mining properties comprises one hundred and sixty acres., The biggest mine in that district is owned by her. Much of her land is, subleased.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Morrison--who was a good woman in her way, and devoted much, time to the poor and sick of New York--would not let him off. They got, to the house of Ched Ramar without Clarice getting an opportunity to, throw in more than a few words here and there, and he did not see her, again until they were in the handsomely furnished reception rooms of the, Indian scholar, and were looking at the curiosities on all sides.\\n\\nHalf an hour later he was explaining to the reporter what was required, of him. The latter was to earn the twenty dollars by interviewing a firm, of lawyers named Hodginson & Lehman, and a young woman named Miss, Marjorie Dorman, if he could find her. He was to ask them about a, breach-of-promise suit which the Honorable Sugden Lawrence had settled, out of court by the payment of thirty thousand dollars.\\n\\n\\u201cEvidently your informant hasn\\u2019t kept you well posted,\\u201d Owen replied, dryly. \\u201cI was ordered there, but I was called back. You see, Mr., Coggswell, you are not the only man who has a pull at Washington. My, friend Judge Lawrence has a friend there who is quite influential in, post-office affairs. He lives at the White House. When he heard that the, judge needed me here, he was kind enough to countermand that transfer, order.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes. I looked a few minutes ago, to make sure. Somehow, I hate to leave, it in the house when I am away. It is something I never have done, before. Still, I am not afraid it will be found--even if my burglar, should come while I am away. He may do that, if he is keeping as close a, watch on me as I think he must. I have too much faith in my hiding, place.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is the truth,\\u201d Inspector Sheridan returned quietly. \\u201cThe speech you, have just made on this platform is enough to convict you. But, in, addition to that, I have arrested the carrier who handed the letter to, your man, Bill Hillman, and I have a complete confession from him. We, have such a good case, Boss Coggswell, that we are fully confident of, the result. Not only are you going to lose the leadership of this, district, but you are going away for a few years to keep your friend and, accomplice, Jake Hines, company in prison.\\u201d\\n\\nBut, although he was an eloquent speaker, he was forced to realize that, his oratory could not save the day. His audiences smiled skeptically, when he protested that he had had nothing to do with the desperate, attempt to railroad young Sheridan to jail. They smiled still more, incredulously when he denied Judge Lawrence\\u2019s charge that he had derived, revenue from the sale of tickets for the various outings of the Samuel, J. Coggswell Association.\\n\\nMoriarity investigated the predicament of the snake and saw that it had, found a nest of eggs, part of which were on one side of the fence and, part on the other side. The snake had swallowed an egg on the \\u201cnear\\u201d, side of the fence and then had poked its head through the crack and, swallowed another egg. With two eggs in its throat, one on each side of, the crack, the snake was a prisoner. Moriarity killed the snake but did, not rescue the eggs.\\n\\n\\u201cActually, Mr. Carter, I cannot tell. I must have been so absorbed in my, own thoughts that I didn\\u2019t notice how far the car went, or where I left, it. All I know is that I found myself at home again after a while, and, that I got off the car that brought me here at the corner, two blocks, down our avenue. I had been thinking about various things the whole, time, and I had performed my whole journey mechanically. It is not often, I do that, but it has happened before, and if you had not asked me about, it, I should not have given it any further thought.\\u201d\\n\\nMichael Comerford, of St. Johns, Newfoundland, claims to have discovered, a process of developing a film which, when placed in front of any, object, no matter of what character or size, absorbs the color and exact, form of the said object and presents a surrounding which hides from view, any object behind without the object being visible. In other words, the, invention is all that is claimed for it, and it makes it possible for a, man or a body of men to disappear in a twinkling. Mr. Comerford has, given several demonstrations of the invention to his friends, who say, that it will revolutionize modern warfare.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you quite sure that you have the goods on Judge Lawrence regarding, that breach-of-promise case?\\u201d asked Sheridan, with a quizzical smile., \\u201cPerhaps you are mistaken, Coggswell. Perhaps the judge is not quite the, rascal you have painted him. It is true that he is acquainted with a, young person named Marjorie Dorman. It is also true that he is very fond, of her. But it is not true that he has ever asked her to marry him. As a, matter of fact, she is not quite old enough to consider a proposal of, that sort. She is only six years old. She is the judge\\u2019s little niece.\\u201d\\n\\nNick did not believe Ched Ramar was the person he pretended to be. He, doubted even whether he were an Indian at all. Well did the detective, know the almost diabolical skill of the notorious Sang Tu, head of the, Yellow Tong, and it would not surprise him at all to find that Ched, Ramar was carrying out the behests of the unscrupulous Celestial in, obtaining his strange power over Clarice Bentham.\\n\\nBoss Coggswell frowned. \\u201cYoung man, you had better be careful. I warn, you that if you go ahead with this foolishness the consequences will be, most disastrous to you. I presume this is a piece of spite work on the, part of my opponent. No doubt he has heard that I\\u2019ve got the goods on, him regarding that breach-of-promise case, and he thinks he\\u2019ll be able, to square himself with the voters of this district by making this, outrageous move.\\u201d\\n\\nThis was all shooting in the dark for Nick Carter. But he knew the ways, of Ched Ramar. He had not been idle all day, and he had found out from a, friend of his at police headquarters considerably about Ched Ramar\\u2019s, methods. It is a way the police have--that of making a few secret, inquiries about mysterious foreigners in New York who have plenty of, money and no particular apparent business.\\n\\n\\u201cI shall not rest until I have satisfied myself on several points that, have a direct bearing on the mystery. I am in hopes that when I have, done that, I shall have a report for you that will be valuable. I cannot, say any more than that at this stage. I will call you up as soon as I, have something to communicate. Meanwhile, I should advise you not to, walk about the streets or go into public places much.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy friends, as you all know, since the start of this contest I have, deplored personal attacks. I have raised my voice in protest against the, outrageous mud slinging indulged in by my opponent and his misguided, friends. But inasmuch as they have persisted in their shameful abuse of, a man who for seventeen years has worked night and day to serve the, people of this district, I feel justified in showing you that we can do, a little mud slinging, too.

The, hundred-dollar bill and the letter which the envelope contained were, each in four pieces. I was afraid to go to the post office and explain, how it had happened, because I knew that if I did so it would get, Carrier Andrews into trouble for violating the rules. So I decided to, cut some sticking plaster into small strips, and paste the pieces, together. I made quite a neat job of it; then I addressed a fresh, envelope, inclosed the patched-up letter and hundred-dollar bill, and, dropped it into a mail box.\\u201d\\n\\nAs the detective moved about with the others, looking at the many, curious idols of various metals that were disposed about the great, rooms, and answering readily to his assumed name of Doctor Hodgson, he, seemed not to have any interest outside of what he was inspecting with, the other guests.

I only mentioned this to, convince you that the power which put Andrew Anderton out of the world, is not likely to hesitate at breaking into your house and stealing the, records that were the cause of his assassination.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI beg your pardon for laughing, Miss Bentham,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut, really, I, had never thought of my poor idols in that light before. These things, that so many thousands of people in Asia believe can save them from all, ill, and bring succor to them in distress--surely ought not to frighten, any one, even an American young lady. But, if you are timid, why, I\\u2019ll, take you down at once.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe idea was to set a little trap for you,\\u201d Owen explained. \\u201cAs I said, before, the judge has had cause to suspect for some time that his mail, was being tampered with--that somebody was steaming open the envelopes, and reading their contents before they were delivered to him. He put the, matter in my hands, and we decided to make a little test to ascertain, whether his suspicions were correct. We fixed up a decoy letter. It told, of an imaginary check for thirty thousand dollars which the judge paid, to settle an imaginary breach-of-promise suit. It was sent to the judge, through the mails, and was intercepted in the usual way by you\\n\\n\\u201cIt was something like that,\\u201d confessed Swagara. \\u201cBut not quite. Ched, Ramar saw me in a restaurant on the East Side of New York, where I, sometimes play chess. He is a chess player, and he got into conversation, with me one night. It ended in my saying I wanted employment, and, soon--I don\\u2019t know how it was--I found myself engaged by him. I keep his, rooms in order, and I do anything he tells me.\\u201d\\n\\nBoss Coggswell was disappointed, but not dismayed. \\u201cI scarcely expected, that you\\u2019d be able to make them talk,\\u201d he told his newspaper friend;, \\u201cbut I thought it was worth trying. Of course, the more details I could, get about the case the better. However, I have enough information for my, purpose. Come around to Colfax Hall to-night, and you\\u2019ll see some fun., I\\u2019m going to address a big meeting there--the biggest of the whole, campaign--and I\\u2019m going to hand a big jolt to my dear friend the judge., I don\\u2019t imagine that he\\u2019ll be as popular with the voters of this, district after I get through with him. If you can\\u2019t come yourself, you\\u2019d, better see that your paper sends another man to cover the meeting. I\\u2019m, going to notify all the other papers. I want every sheet in town to, print my speech.\\u201d\\n\\n, When it comes to detective stories worth while, the =Nick Carter Stories=, contain the only ones that should be considered. They are not overdrawn, tales of bloodshed. They rather show the working of one of the finest, minds ever conceived by a writer. The name of Nick Carter is familiar, all over the world, for the stories of his adventures may be read in, twenty languages. No other stories have withstood the severe test of, time so well as those contained in the =Nick Carter Stories=. It proves, conclusively that they are the best. We give herewith a list of some of, the back numbers in print. You can have your news dealer order them, or, they will be sent direct by the publishers to any address upon receipt, of the price in money or postage stamps.\\n\\nThere was a rescue. But it never got into the papers. There were no, papers to print thrilling adventures that occurred around the Missouri, River bluffs in those days. The mother, Mrs. John Godola, walked right, out of the house, stopped the squaw, and took the child away from her., If it were to-day, the movies would have a thriller on the screen about, it. But that was before Edison or any one else had thought of making, pictures walk and talk; also, those were the days when experience with, the Indians were many and grotesque. A mere kidnaping did not attract, much attention.\\n\\n\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t find that out. Maggie seems to be afraid to say much about, Ched. All she has been told is that he is a millionaire, and she has, that only on the strength of the jewelry he wears when he goes out, and, the fact that swell people visit him. He has not lived at that house, very long. When he moved in, about six weeks ago, all the things he, brought with him were truckloads of big packing cases. Some of these, were as big as a house, according to Maggie\\u2019s cousin--or sister. When, all those were in, furniture came from some big store. It was all new\\n\\nPickels has commanded her. She was designed for work in Northern waters., As the bronze plate in the captain\\u2019s cabin sets forth, she was presented, to Doctor Wilfred Grenfell in July, 1911, by George B. Cluett. That she, went to sea with purposes other than those of the ordinary trading, schooner, the plate makes plain in these few words: \\u201cThe Sea is His and, He Made It.\\u201d The inscription in the brass band which binds the wheel\\n\\nWhen Julia was brought here in connection with the effort to raise funds, for Hose Truck No. 2, her fierce, untamed conduct, coupled with the fact, that she was said to have two teeth, made the firemen fearful for the, safety of their friends, who, after paying their admission, foolishly, insisted upon feeding peanuts and stick caramels to the evil-eyed, man-eater. The situation became so desperate that Julia growled every, time she woke up--about twice a day.\\n\\n\\u201cMY DEAR JUDGE: I beg to acknowledge receipt of your check for,      thirty thousand dollars, in full settlement of the claims of our,      client, Miss Marjorie Dorman. In consideration of this payment our,      client agrees to abandon her action against you for breach of,      promise of marriage, and to return all letters written to her by,      you. Formal agreement to this effect will be mailed to you under,      separate cover.\\n\\n\\u201cBless me!\\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly drawing back with affected, astonishment after he had completed this operation. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a postage, stamp on this envelope, Bill--an uncanceled stamp. Queer that I didn\\u2019t, notice it before. It looked as if this letter must have somehow dropped, out of the mail. You\\u2019d better take it right away and hand it to a letter, carrier. As good citizens, Bill, it is our duty to see that the United, States mails are not delayed any longer than is absolutely necessary.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t mind the change at all,\\u201d said Owen to Judge Lawrence. \\u201cIt, will be a nice honeymoon trip for us\\u201d--for the transfer order reached, him on the very day of his marriage to Dallas--\\u201cbut I hate the idea of, being away from New York while you are waging your primary battle, against that crook. I was in hopes that I would be able to repay a, little of what you have done for me by helping you in your campaign.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat Buddha and other things in this room will interest you for some, time, Miss Bentham, I have no doubt,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I can hardly remain, away from my guests. I will leave you alone. When you are ready to come, down, you know how to work the elevator. Although it is possible that, some of the other ladies below will be up to see the idols before you, have finished looking at them.\\u201d\\n\\nCoggswell grew more and more alarmed by the strength which his opponent, displayed. Word reached him that the voters of the district were, flocking by thousands to the ex-jurist\\u2019s banner. Men who had never taken, the trouble to vote at a primary election before were taking a keen, interest in this fight. Judge Lawrence was conducting a whirlwind, campaign, and his forceful oratory had the district stirred as it had, never been stirred before.\\n\\nAlthough the proved nimbleness of the _Cluett_ leads her charterers to, hope that she may slip in and out with the rescued MacMillan party in, time to get back to New York in November, the way food supplies have, been poured into her show that no chances are to be taken in a locality, where, as the captain remarked, \\u201cye can\\u2019t fetch stuff from a grocery, \\u2019round the corner.\\u2019\\u201d He shed light upon what for a dozen men might be, considered a two years\\u2019 food supply. Some two thousand pounds of beef\\n\\nHe was afraid, however, to bring about the dismissal of the man before, primary-election day; he knew that if he did so Judge Lawrence would not, fail to make political capital out of the incident; so he decided to, wait until the contest for the district leadership was over. In the, meantime, for safety\\u2019s sake, he contrived to have Sheridan transferred, from the New York district. This he could bring about without laying, himself open to the charge of persecution. A little wire pulling at, Washington, and, without Boss Coggswell\\u2019s name being mentioned in the, matter at all, Owen received peremptory orders to report to the chief, inspector of the San Francisco branch.\\n\\nIt was at this moment that Chick came into the library, attired as a, Chinaman of the poorer class. He wore the blue blouse and trousers, common to laundrymen in America, and his face was of the pale yellow, that is always associated with Mongolians in the average mind. He wore a, large, soft black hat, which completely concealed his head. He wore a, wig, with a queue, but it was not convincing if closely examined, and, Nick Carter had told him to keep on his hat under all circumstances.\\n\\n\\u201cLook here, Carter!\\u201d interrupted Bentham impatiently. \\u201cThis is sheer, waste of time. What if my daughter did take an early-morning walk? There, is nothing remarkable in that. She is a healthy young girl, with a love, of nature. When can you enjoy nature better than in the beginning of a, fine day? But it has nothing to do with this loss of my papers. How, could it have any bearing on such a matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know. I got a card addressed to me. But there is a line, on the card to the effect that any friend of mine will be welcome. It is, written in pencil. The remainder of the card is lithographed. If you, would like to go, I should be pleased to take you in. My daughter is, going, with her aunt, Mrs. Morrison. She is Clarice\\u2019s mother\\u2019s sister.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen, half an hour later, the party left the house, the two ladies had, the magnificently carved jade vases to which Ched Ramar had referred., But Clarice held clasped to her bosom, as if she feared she might lose, it, the gold idol that seemed to have been merely an uncontemplated, gift, but which Nick Carter remembered had been promised to her by the, strange voice from the lips of the gigantic Buddha.\\n\\n\\u201cI won\\u2019t be in the jug long,\\u201d he declared confidently to the deputy, sheriff who led him, shackled, out of the courtroom. \\u201cBoss Coggswell, will get me out. His pull will win me a pardon, all right. So long as, he\\u2019s my friend I\\u2019m not worryin\\u2019. And not only will he get me free,\\u201d he, added, a glint coming into his beady eyes, \\u201cbut you can bet he\\u2019ll make, it hot for everybody that\\u2019s had a hand in sending me up. That judge\\u2019ll, get his for handing me such a stiff sentence; the district attorney will, be made to regret that he wouldn\\u2019t let up when the boss gave him the, hint; and as for that big stiff of a Sheridan--well, I\\u2019m willing to bet, a thousand to a hundred that he won\\u2019t be holding that inspector\\u2019s job, very long. They\\u2019ll all be made to feel that it ain\\u2019t healthy to defy a, man like Samuel J. Coggswell.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI need scarcely say,\\u201d he explained unctuously to the group of newspaper, men who were on the platform to see Hines depart, \\u201cthat there is no man, who condemns and deplores more than I the atrocious crime for which that, wretched young man is about to pay the penalty. Still, I cannot quite, forget the time when poor, misguided Jake Hines was an honest man, who, enjoyed my esteem and friendship. It is in memory of those days\\n\\n\\u201cI know that. Ched Ramar doesn\\u2019t like his affairs talked about. But you, are quite safe here. I know Ched Ramar, and he has no secrets from me--I, mean, of an ordinary nature. You have been with him ever since he took, that house in which he lives at present--on Brooklyn Heights. You never, met him until you were recommended to him by somebody whom you do not, know. Ched Ramar has never told you how he came to know of you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe armature is less than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and the, wire is of the size of number one-hundred thread. A jeweler\\u2019s microscope, must be used to see the different parts, and the whole thing weighs only, twenty grains, or as much as a third of a teaspoonful of water. When, coupled with small dry batteries, it runs at very high velocity and, makes a noise like a fly on a windowpane.\\n\\n\\u201cI did,\\u201d she admitted readily. \\u201cProfessor Ched Ramar showed it to me, himself. He only told me that it was a fine specimen. Then he went away., When I was alone, I climbed up to look at the face of the idol, and, Doctor Hodgson, who came into the room, spoke to me about it in a, general way. Professor Ched Ramar also came in, with my aunt, Mrs., Morrison, and my father. Ched Ramar afterward gave me a small gold, idol.\\u201d\\n\\nFor some time it has been impossible for the family of James Rich, of, Fidelity, to use the stove in the summer kitchen, because the flue had, become choked in some manner. The other day Mrs. Rich noticed a cat, sitting on the stove and looking steadfastly at the stovepipe. At the, same time Mrs. Rich\\u2019s attention was attracted by a tap-tap-tapping, sound. Although the woman is not a spiritualist, she answered the three, taps by rapping on the stove with a fork handle. The taps responded from, the stovepipe.\\n\\nHillman grinned again as the boss folded the letter, replaced it in the, envelope, and carefully gummed down the flap. It had been opened by, holding it over a steaming kettle, and was necessary for Coggswell to, resort to the mucilage bottle on his desk in order to close it again. He, performed the task with a dexterity which showed that he was a master, craftsman at that sort of thing, taking great care not to invite, suspicion by applying too much mucilage.\\n\\nThe concussion was too much for Ched Ramar. It doubled him up, so that, Nick Carter got a better hold on the handle of the scimitar than he had, been able to obtain heretofore. At first he thought he had won the, weapon altogether. But Ched Ramar\\u2019s hold was too sure for that. He still, retained his grip, but not quite so good a one as he had had, because, there was not so much room for his fingers.\\n\\nWar was the first setback circus people experienced. Then came the, foot-and-mouth disease among live stock. Each at first had an indirect, result, but now the loss of foreign acrobats, animal trainers, and wild, animals, together with the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, prescribing narrow zones in which a circus can move for fear of carrying, or contracting the foot-and-mouth disease, have caused lots of trouble, for the three-ring showmen.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Doom of Sang Tu; or, Nick Carter\\u2019s Golden Foe,\\u201d will be the,      title of the long, complete story which you will find in the next,      issue, No. 153, of the NICK CARTER STORIES, out August 14th. In,      this story you will read of the great detective\\u2019s ultimate triumph,      over the shrewd leader of the Yellow Tong. Then, too, you will also,      find an installment of a new serial, together with several other,      articles of interest.\\n\\nor a sense of justice, but because she had started a suit for breach of, promise against him, and he was afraid of the scandal. He was afraid of, being shown up to his fellow men in his true colors, so he paid her, thirty thousand dollars hush money to call off the suit. The name of, this young woman is Miss Marjorie Dorman. I challenge the _Honorable_, Sugden Lawrence to deny these facts.\\u201d The speaker placed withering, emphasis upon the word honorable. \\u201cI challenge him to deny that he paid, that money to prevent the breach-of-promise suit from going to court.\\u201d\\n\\n, The opportunity which came to Boss Coggswell was in the form of a, letter. Bill Hillman brought it to him as he sat in his private office, at the headquarters of the Samuel J. Coggswell Association. Hillman was, one of his henchmen, who, during the enforced absence of Jake Hines, had, been chosen by the boss to fill that unfortunate young man\\u2019s place as, his confidential man. He was not as able a worker as Jake, judged by the, standard which had made the latter so useful to his chief, but he, combined the qualities of shrewdness, audacity, and unscrupulousness to, a greater degree than anybody else in the organization; therefore\\n\\nThe judge made it a point to go extensively into the details of those, notorious outings. He quoted figures to show that at each outing the, sale of tickets had brought in several thousand dollars more than the, total expenses. He charged that this surplus had gone into the boss\\u2019, coffers, and exposed the blackmailing methods by which Jake Hines and, the other lieutenants had forced the reluctant civil-service employees, and business men of the district to take tickets. It made excellent, campaign material.\\n\\nHe is thirty-six years of age and has a wife and seven children. He, attended the Indian school at Genoa, Neb., three years and attended, school at Carlisle, Pa., in the year 1902. While he was a student there, during that year he played center on the famous Indian football team. He, then weighed two hundred and five pounds. He has written some newspaper, articles on Indian clan organizations and Indian burial customs, and has, co\\u00f6perated with the government in anthropological research.\",\n          \"\\\"There'll be some little chance of their swimmin' ashore if they haven't, got too many clothes on,\\\" Uncle Zenas replied mournfully, and then he, raised his head quickly as the muffled report of the gun could be heard., \\\"I'm proud of 'em, Sonny, proud of 'em! Talk about men being brave! I've, wintered an' summered with them two, an' you can't find more courage in, the same weight of human bein's than they've got!\\\"\\n\\nThe famous Pharos of Alexandria, built about 285 B.C. is the first,     light of undoubted record. The light-house at Corunna, Spain, is,     believed to be the oldest existing light-tower. This was built in,     the reign of Trajan, and in 1634 it was reconstructed. The erection,     of the Eddystone Light-house, off Plymouth, England, formed an era,     in the construction of light-houses. The masonry was 76 feet 6,     inches, and the top of the lantern 93 feet, above the foundation.,     It was completed in 1759. The various courses were so dovetailed,     into each other, and the whole fifty so secured together, that the,     tower was almost as solid as if cut out of the solid block. Immense,     difficulties had to be overcome from the first landing on the rock,     on April 5, 1756, to the laying of the first stone, June 12, 1757\\n\\n\\\"It don't stand to reason that 'ere craft has got shipwrecked men, aboard, else we would see 'em, Sammy, an' I'm certain she's light, but, for a man in the stern-sheets. Here comes the fog agin, and whoever's, steerin' stands a mighty slim chance of strikin' Carys' Ledge, if it so, be he wants to make this 'ere bit of rock. I do hate to get so mixed up, before breakfast! Why couldn't the idjut have waited until long towards, noon, when we hadn't much of anything to do, before he hove in sight?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wa'al, he declared I shouldn't have the least little crumb, an' off I, started on work that was as much for his benefit as my own. When I got, aboard the wreck I found it was goin' to be possible to get away with a, good deal more'n could be loaded into the dory, so I built a raft, an', Sonny dear, I had timber an' ropes there that would have done your heart, good to see! Of course it wasn't a great while before I found out that, we was likely to have a storm, an' I jest threw the stuff together in, the hope of gettin' back to the ledge before the wind got too high.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a bit of it, Sonny,\\\" Captain Eph cried with a hearty laugh. \\\"You've, saved me a world of trouble, perhaps, for if I'd said anything of the, kind to Uncle Zenas he'd been certain to want it this way or that, an', we'd had a heap of tongue-waggin' before gettin' the matter settled. Now, he'll go ahead in his own way, as he thinks, an' the job is done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Before Uncle Zenas gets around agin you'll be a first-class cook,\\\", Captain Eph said when the supper was on the table, and Sidney was, heating some of the canned soup with the hope that the second assistant, would swallow it. \\\"Beats all how handy you are. Haven't been on Carys', Ledge hardly long enough to get acquainted, an' know how to look after, the light! It won't be a great while before you can run the whole, business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sammy did his full share of the work, Sonny, an' did it like a little, man,\\\" the old keeper said, continuing his story as if there had not been, any interruption. \\\"The first time we ran down, the captain of the, wrecked vessel tossed one of the men aboard us, for the poor fellow was, so far gone he couldn't help himself. The second trip we got another, passenger in the same way, an' the third venture, which was nigh bein', the last of our work, owin' to an ugly sea catchin' us when we were, within four or five feet of the wreck, the other two men jumped aboard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll allow it was a pretty tough job; but nothing to be compared, with what the Board has done in other places. Now I was reading, not a, great while ago, in one of the books the inspector sends us, about their, building a tower on a rock off the coast of Oregon called Tillamook., Putting one up here wasn't a marker alongside the trouble they had with, that, because there wasn't many days in the summer when a full crew, couldn't work here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The light is forty-eight feet above the base of the tower and 136 feet, above sea-level. It was shown for the first time on February 1, 1881. If, it had been finished a month earlier it would possibly have saved the, English iron bark _Lupata_ of 1,039 tons burden, which was dashed to, pieces on the main shore, not a mile from the light-house, with a loss, of the vessel, its freight, and every one of the twenty persons on, board. The bark came so near the rock that the creaking of the blocks, and the voices of the officers giving orders were distinctly heard, but, the night was so dark that nothing could be seen except her lights. The, superintendent of construction had a bon-fire built on the rock as soon, as possible, but the vessel was probably lost before the signal could be, seen. It was on this night that the working party lost their, supply-house and came so near losing their quarters, if not their, lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a foolish question,\\\" he said, speaking aloud as if to hear the, sound of his own voice. \\\"I've _got_ to stay, because I couldn't go away, if I was willing to leave the light alone. It isn't likely any of them, will be back before morning, and I'd be ashamed to confess that I'd made, a baby of myself at a time when it is possible to be of some service to, those who have been so kind to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One evening a fisher from Milford, who had succeeded in landing at, Smalls in an intermission of calm weather, brought to Solway the two, keepers, but one of them was a corpse. The survivor had made a coffin, for his dead comrade, then, after having carried it to a corner of the, gallery, he had stood it on end, attaching it firmly. Left alone he had, done good service. When returned on shore he was so changed, so, emaciated, that his relatives and friends could scarcely recognize him., He asserted that his comrade had died of disease; he was believed, but, after this time there were always three keepers at Smalls in the place, of two--a wise precaution which has since been taken for light-houses, placed in similar conditions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From that moment,\\\" Mr. Sawyer said as he concluded the sad story, \\\"he, remained aft in the bottom of the boat, and I was unable to arouse him., How long we drifted after that, I cannot rightly say; but when I saw you, making preparations to aid us, I tried to pull him to his feet, that he, might be in shape to help himself in some slight degree. I believe he, was already dead, and, knowing that I could not get ashore through the, surf burdened with his lifeless body, I gave no further heed to him., Even as it was, I came near drowning Mr. Peters, for the two of us were, rolled over and over half a dozen times before you pulled us to our, feet, and then I was so dazed that but for his grip on my collar I must, have fallen back into the surf.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We ran down a spar, and he was leaning over the bow trying to make out, if it was a buoy that had gone adrift, or a portion of the wreckage we, had sighted, when a heavy sea came. It seemed to me as if the timber, struck Mr. Sawyer on the head, for over he went like a log, and although, I put the boat back and forth until it grew too dark to see, I couldn't, find him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir, and I made a fool of myself by crying at first. When I got, over that it seemed as if the minutes were as long as hours, and I, wondered how I would get through the night. The worst of it all was that, I didn't believe you could get back to-night, and I knew if a storm came, you wouldn't be able to land on the ledge.\\\"\\n\\nThere is little doubt but that the early colonists recognized the,     necessity for beacons with which to guide their home-returning,     shallops to a safe anchorage, and that they took effective means to,     show the English and Dutch ships which should make their land-fall,     at night the safe way to the harbor. But the first authentic,     evidence of this being done at the public charge, is the record of,     the proceedings of the general court of the Province of,     Massachusetts Bay, from which it appears that on March 9, 1673, a,     petition came from the citizens of Nantasket, Massachusetts (now,     Hull), for the lessening of their taxes, because of the material,     and labor they had expended over and above their proportion in,     building the beacon on Point Allerton, the most prominent headland,     near the entrance to Boston harbor. At that session also it appears,     that bills were paid from Nantasket for making and furnishing,     \\\"fier-bales of pitch and ocum for the beacon at Allerton Point,\\\",     which \\\"fier-bales\\\" were burned in an iron grate or basket on the,     top of a beacon, for the building of which Nantasket had furnished,     400 boat-loads of stone.\\n\\n\\\"It strikes me that a man of your age, Cap'n Eph, could be in better, business than tellin' stories about light-houses that have been carried, away, to a lad who's gettin' his first taste of a storm in a place like, this! I wouldn't have thanked anybody for spinnin' sich yarns the first, year I came on this ledge. We didn't have a heavy sea in all that time, but I expected the tower would go, an' when a nor'easter struck us, I, allowed there wasn't any show of savin' our lives.\\\"\\n\\nSidney stood ready with the lantern curtains until the keeper should, show him how they ought to be hung, for he had come to believe there was, a rule for the most trifling labor, when an exclamation of surprise, caused him to turn toward the door in the floor, and he saw the head and, shoulders of Mr. Peters, who was surveying the scene with a comical, expression on his face.\\n\\nMr. Peters had made his way over the rocks to the very line of surf, and, stood there until the moment should come for the supreme effort, while, Uncle Zenas and Captain Eph watched his every movement closely, prepared, to slacken the rope or haul in as should be necessary when the battle, with the waves was begun. Nearly in the center of the room, but where he, could see all that took place, Sidney stood, his eyes fixed on the boat, while his hands were clenched as if by much straining of the muscles he, might aid in the coming struggle.\\n\\n\\\"What good would it do you to eat the buff-skin, Sammy?\\\" Captain Eph, asked in a mild tone, and without looking up from his task of polishing, the lenses. \\\"It stands to reason that you'd have a fit of the dyspepsy, after doin' it, an' then I'd be called upon to report that we'd lost a, buff-skin, an' the best part of Number 12 from the medicine chest, for, I'd feel it my duty to doctor you up to the best of my ability an' the, printed instructions from the Board, even though you had been makin' a, fool of yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course you couldn't have an idea that any accident would happen, because of your staying in bed as you did, and so I don't think you're, as much to blame as you make out,\\\" Sidney said earnestly. \\\"You needn't, worry that I'll ever tell Captain Eph or Uncle Zenas what you've said;, but if they knew the whole story, I'm certain neither of them would look, at it as you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I remember rightly, it was sometime in October of 1879, when the, steam tender landed four men with drills, hammers, and such like, to say, nothing of provisions, fuel, a stove, an' some canvas for them to make a, shanty of. There those poor, wretched creeters hung to the rock like, starfish, not able to do much of anything more than keep themselves from, tumbling off into the water. It was three days before they got five, other men an' a small derrick on to that blessed rock, an' for near to, two weeks they had nothin' to shelter them from the rain and the spray, but that 'ere square of canvas they had carried out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Although persons are appointed to the service and assigned to a given, station, they are frequently transferred from one station to another, as, the interest of the service may demand, and while it is usual to consult, a keeper's wishes in his assignments, there is nothing in the, regulations to prevent the transfer of a man appointed in Maine to a, station in Georgia; and occasionally keepers are, with their own, consent, transferred from one district to another at a great distance., Young men who have seen some sea service are preferred as assistants at, the larger stations; and at stations requiring but one keeper, retired, sea captains or mates who have families are frequently selected.\\n\\nA comical appearance did the lad present when he was clad in oiled, garments which had been made for the cook. It was necessary to turn back, the sleeves of the coat until he had around his wrists huge rolls of the, stiff fabric, causing Mr. Peters to remark that in case they \\\"needed, fenders for the boat it would only be necessary for Sonny to let his, arms hang over the rail.\\\" The legs of the trousers were treated in the, same manner as the sleeves, and when he was fully clad, the skirt of the, coat dragged on the ground, while the waistband of the trousers was, fastened under his arms.\\n\\nstandin' high out of fifteen fathom of water, an' a full mile from the, mainland. As I remember, it's located twenty miles south of the mouth of, the Columbia River. It seems, 'cordin' to the printed story, that that, 'ere rock was split in two, with a wide crack running east an' west, an', the top of it was about a hundred feet above the level of the sea., Nothin' larger than fifty foot square could be built on it, an' it was a, mighty ticklish job for even sailormen to get a footin' there, even in, the fairest of fair weather. Why, the foreman of the first crew that, went off was drownded when the natives thereabouts allowed that the sea, was calm. That put a damper, so to speak, on the work; but the Board was, bound to have a light there, an' when they get their minds set on a, thing, it's pretty sure to be brought about.\\n\\n, The tears nearly blinded the lad as he lighted the lamp, started the, clock, and watched to make certain it was running smoothly. Then he, raised the wick until the flame was of the same size as Captain Eph had, said was required to get the greatest amount of light without danger of, smoke, and, closing the door of the lantern softly lest the echoes, should be aroused, crept down to the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"Bless you, no, Sonny. There was the Eddystone, off Plymouth, England., It was a fanciful sort of a thing, an' disappeared during a hurricane in, the year 1703. The tower was rebuilt, an' in 1755 was burned, because, there was a good deal of wood-work inside, which you won't find in, light-houses built nowadays. That makes up the list of coast lights that, have been destroyed, so you see we needn't bother our heads about, anything of the kind happenin' here, for Carys' Ledge Light has stood, against many a worse gale than this.\\\"\\n\\nAt the same moment Captain Eph began to descend the iron stairs at the, best possible speed, and, on arriving at the landing immediately over, the kitchen, saw that which caused him to believe the disaster was, fully as great as Sidney had announced. In his eagerness he leaped, his, feet struck the stair midway from the bottom, and down he came like a, log, lying motionless on the floor as if he had been killed.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's our well,\\\" Uncle Zenas said in reply to Sidney's question., \\\"Least-ways it's a hole in the masonry which is filled every once in a, while by the water-boat from the harbor, which comes out here for that, purpose. Yonder is the oil, and our lamp eats lots of it. This 'ere is, what is known as a first order light, an' we use somewhere over eight, hundred gallons of oil in a year. The Light-House Board sends all our, supplies, for it stands to reason we can't run out to the shop whenever, we're needin' anythin' extra.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that bein' the case, Sammy, after I've entered in the watch book, an account of his comin' here, an' set down the fact that I count on, keepin' the lad till somebody comes to claim him, I reckon it's nobody's, business but mine an' the United States Government's. He's here, an', here he stays, unless the inspector says he must be turned adrift, in, which case I'll go with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Although but one grade of keeper is recognized by law, usage has, divided keepers into a number of grades, with different pay as well as, different duties, and with promotion running through the various grades., At one light-house there may be but one keeper; at another, a principal, keeper and an assistant; and there is a station where there is a, principal keeper with four assistants, the fourth having the lowest, grade and the lowest pay, and the others having been appointed at that, grade, and promoted as merit was shown and vacancies occurred; or they, may have been transferred and promoted from another station.\\n\\n\\\"We wouldn't take the value of a cent if you had all the money in the, land,\\\" Captain Eph cried emphatically. \\\"This 'ere crew tries to do its, duty by the Government, an' when that's been done, if we can work in a, little overtime, like takin' you off the wreck, we feel as if we could, look ourselves in the face knowin' we'd lent a hand when it was needed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here she is, an' there's a good bit of meanin' to it, lad. 'The lens, and the glass of the lantern must be cleaned daily and always kept in, the best possible condition. Before beginning to clean the lens it must, be brushed with the feather brush to remove all dust. It must then be, wiped with a soft linen cloth, and finally polished with buff-skin. If, there is oil or grease on any part, it must be taken off with a linen, cloth, moistened with spirits of wine, and then polished with a, buff-skin. Under no circumstances must a skin which has been wet or damp, be used, as this will scratch the lens.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All the light stuff would have been in the cabin, an' I'm allowin' that, a good bit of it will be washed up on the ledge,\\\" Captain Eph said as he, looked with a weatherly eye at the sky. \\\"We're goin' to have the wind, from the east'ard mighty soon, if signs count for anything, an' then's, when you'll get all the lumber needed for half a dozen boats, though, where it can be stored for the winter beats me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you're goin' to settle down to a spell of writin', an' I'm allowin', it won't be any small job to put the thing together ship-shape, I'll see, what can be done toward patchin' up the boy's boat,\\\" Mr. Peters said as, if making a suggestion. \\\"If we get any good weather, an' the motor is, in fair shape, it mightn't be very much of a trip to run across.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why don't you go an' fix up my bed so's we can put him in it, Sammy?, What good do you suppose it does to stand 'round here first on one foot, an' then on the other as if you was a brazen image?\\\" Captain Eph, demanded fiercely of his first assistant, and the latter ran up the, spiral stairway, hurriedly, muttering something about the folly of, treating a case such as the one in hand, before first studying the, \\\"rules and regerlations\\\" to learn whether the Board had made any, provisions for similar emergencies.\\n\\n\\\"All it needed was a clear head an' plenty of grit, Sonny,\\\" Captain Eph, added. \\\"We were stripped down to it till we had to work or freeze, an', so we kept her goin', but more'n once I made up my mind that we'd have, to turn back in spite of the hankerin' to give them poor fellows a lift., Sammy ain't overly fond of laborin', as a general thing; but I must say, he pulled away this forenoon as if he was a glutton at it, an' time an', time again it seemed as if he reg'larly lifted the dory out'er the water, with his oars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, he's lookin' 'round to see what kind of a chance he can find for, launchin' the dory! He's crazy, dead crazy! Of course I know how wild he, is at bein' obleeged to stay here idle when people are bein' drowned, before our very eyes, even though we can't see 'em, for I feel the same, way; but he an' Sammy will be only givin' up their own lives in tryin', anythin' of the kind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me and my assistants believe it is our duty, though not so laid,     down in the rules and regulations, to make a special report because,     this morning a small boy came on to the ledge in a motor boat that,     got smashed up pretty considerable on the rocks while making a,     landing, said boy claiming to be the son of Captain Harlow of the,     five-masted schooner _West Wind_ bound for Porto Rico, and he,     wishing to let his father hear that he ain't drownded. Not knowing,     how to send word to the said father that the boy is on this ledge,     safe and sound, with us feeding him out of our rations so that the,     Government won't come short of provisions, I hereby, being of sound,     mind and disposition, make report to you that the said father ought,     to be hunted up by your honorable and respected Board, so that he,     may be able to know that his son ain't yet drownded.\\n\\n\\\"We went out to look at what seemed to be a lot of wreckage; it was so, calm that the _West Wind_ hardly moved through the water, and father, said I might go with Mr. Sawyer, because I know how to run the motor and, steer. Then, before we'd got to the wreckage, the fog shut in, and we, couldn't see the schooner. I believe I could have gone straight to her, at first, but after Mr. Sawyer fell over-board, I turned the boat around, so many times trying to pick him up, that I couldn't tell where the, _West Wind_ might be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frozen? I was so cold, Sonny, that I couldn't tell you what my name, was, an' layin' there on the timbers with the wind blowin' half a gale, didn't tend to make me any warmer. After a while, though, I got to, understand that I'd die for sure if somethin' wasn't done, because I, counted help couldn't come till I'd drifted ashore, an' that mightn't be, much before mornin'. Wa'al, as I figgered it, thinkin' you folks on the, ledge couldn't come out to help me owin' to your not havin' a boat, my, only chance was to work the raft in toward the shore faster'n the wind, was carryin' her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed it isn't, Sonny, not by a long chalk. From the ledge to the, light is only one hundred an' twenty feet; but I've got up-stairs an, account of the highest tower the Board ever built, an' you shall read, it. I ain't tryin' to fill you chock-a-block with facts about, light-houses, but when you spring these 'ere questions on me I can't, help flashin' up what I know about 'em, which ain't a great deal when, you come to simmer it right down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the summer of 1772 Whiteside first made the acquaintance of the, place on which he was to indelibly engrave his name. He disembarked on, the rocks with a gang of Cornish miners, and the obstacles which they, met at the commencement of the work nearly disgusted him with the, enterprise. He and his companions had started the work when a storm, suddenly broke upon them. The wind blew with great force, and the cutter, which had brought them had to fly before the fury of the gale. The, workmen left on the rock hung on the best they could for two days and, nights. Whiteside was not discouraged, and finally brought the work to, a successful end, but not without being exposed to many dangers.\\n\\n\\\"He's right, Sonny; we're bound to set him ashore as soon as it may be, done, an' I'll write to your father myself, tellin' him what we old, shell-backs are willin' to do for the sake of keepin' on Carys' Ledge a, little shaver whom we're mighty glad to have with us. Of course you'd, rather go to him; but since he's arranged for you to stay ashore, I hope, you'll want to stop with us.\\\"\\n\\nthat we must leave the crew of Carys' Ledge and their guest, for the, very good reason that it would not be practicable to follow them day by, day to the present time. The year which Sidney was to remain there does, not come to an end until next October, and, therefore, it is impossible, to say whether he will leave the crew when his father returns, or live, so near them that daily visits may be possible.\\n\\nan' as the wheels go 'round it is raised till the whole of the flame is, uncovered, an' then lowered till it's nearly shut out. The whole thing, is simple enough, but it took a mighty clear-headed man to think it up., When a vessel comes off this coast, an' the cap'n sees Carys' Ledge, light growin' dim an' then brightenin' up, he counts the number of, seconds that go by from one bright flash to another, an' says to, himself, says he: 'That 'ere is a forty-second flash, an' she's about so, an' so off the coast.' Then he dives inter the cabin, hunts up his list, of lights, sees which one answers to the description he's got in mind\\n\\nThe Wolf Rock Light-house, off Land's End, Cornwall, England, is,     the last great British work, and both in its structure and its,     illumination it combines all the refined improvements. A survey was,     made in 1861, and the foundation commenced in March, 1862. In the,     first season only eighty-three hours of work could be done, and,     between that and its completion, on July 19, 1869; there were in,     the eight working seasons two hundred and ninety-six landings on,     the rock, and the time occupied was equal to about one hundred and,     one working days of ten hours each. The cost was L62,726.\\n\\nThe clock which regulated the flashing of the light ticked loudly; the, boom of the surf against the black reef sounded like distant thunder;, but Captain Eph heard nothing save the soft breathing of the lad after, he fell asleep, and saw nothing save the face of the \\\"little shaver\\\", against which he pressed his lips from time to time, while his eyelids, glistened in the lamp-light as if they had been wet with dew.\\n\\n\\\"There are times when it's terribly tryin' to have Sammy pokin' 'round, the kitchen; but if any trouble comes up, you can count on him every, minute of the day or night, no matter how many chances he may be takin', of losin' his own life. He an' Sonny together have run the light, done, the cookin', an' doctored Cap'n Eph and me up in great shape since we, were laid by the heels.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Right you are,\\\" Uncle Zenas added, \\\"an' I for one don't see as there is, any need of talk. We've got stuff enough to eat, an' jest so long as his, appetite sticks by him I'll give him a chance to find out what kind of a, cook I am, though it stands to reason I can't come anywhere near mixin', up what he's been in the habit of gettin' on board one of them big, schooners.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The two men who had life enough left in 'em to bear a hand, bailed the, water out while Sammy an' I pulled at the oars the best we knew how,\\\", Captain Eph continued, \\\"an' when she was lightened a bit, they got out, the second pair of oars. Of course the wind helped us mightily, when we, was homeward bound; but at the same time considerable work was needed to, fetch her in safe. That's all there was to the rescue, Sonny, an' I, reckon Sammy an' I are feelin' a good deal better than if we'd hung, 'round here listenin' to the gun without liftin' a hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because, Sonny, I wouldn't encourage sich pryin',\\\" Captain Eph replied, gravely. \\\"The man ought'er had sense enough to know that the keeper of a, first order light don't run 'round tellin' everything he knows. Perhaps, if he'd come right out an' asked who you was, I might have told him; but, when he beat about the bush, guessin' this and guessin' that, I made up, my mind he shouldn't know the least little thing about what was goin' on, at the ledge.\\\"\\n\\nAn odd-looking man was Mr. Peters (better known to his companions in the, service as \\\"Sammy\\\"), because of the fact that a bullet from the works of, Petersburg had ploughed a deep furrow across his left cheek, and carried, away a goodly portion of one ear. Thus indelibly branded as a veteran of, the Civil War, Mr. Peters had been glad to accept the position of first, assistant keeper of Carys' Ledge light, under the command of his old, comrade-in-arms, Captain Ephraim Downs.\\n\\nDescending the first flight, the keeper came to the watch room, where, was a table, a chair, a stove, and a small lamp for the comfort and, convenience of those who were on duty during the night to make certain, the lamp in the lantern (meaning the floor above), burned steadily; and, here also was a square, upright piece of mechanism known as the driving, clock, which operated the flashing light.\\n\\nIf Mr. Peters had collapsed immediately Captain Eph's needs were, supplied, Sidney would not have been surprised; in fact, he would have, looked upon it as the most natural thing possible. But the first, assistant showed no signs of weakening even now when they were absent, from the scene of the accident; he appeared to be in as good bodily, condition as ever, and the lad was so very curious regarding the, situation that he asked abruptly:\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you what it is, Sonny, we must have our motor boat in, runnin' order before next spring, for pullin' a pair of oars when a man, can jest as well sit still an' let a screw do the work is all nonsense., I've found a fellow who claims he can put your machinery in prime order, for us, an', what's more, he's comin' out here to get it, when the wind, hauls 'round to suit him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Congress prescribed, by act of September 28, 1850, that red buoys, with, even numbers, be placed on the right-hand side, and black buoys, with, odd numbers, on the left-hand side of channels approached from seaward;, that buoys placed on wrecks and other obstructions, having a channel on, each side, be painted with red and black horizontal stripes; that those, buoys placed in mid-channel, and which indicate that they must be passed, close-to to avoid danger, be painted with white and black perpendicular, stripes; and, finally, that perches, with balls, cages, etc., when, placed on buoys, will indicate a turning-point, the color and number of, the buoy showing the side on which they are to be passed.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon comin' out from the ledge has become what you might call, second nature with me, seein's how I've been knockin' about here so, long; but there ain't anything very astonishin' in findin' a shoal that, stands close by a buoy, for a man's ears ought to be as good as his, eyes. Howsomever, we're here, an' now it's our business to catch as many, fish as we can. I'll bait your hook, Sonny, an' you're to let it down, until you feel that the lead strikes bottom, then pull her up four or, five feet an' wait till you get a good, strong jerk. After that it's a, case of landin' your fish, or losin' it, cordin' to the amount of common, sense you bring into play.\\\"\\n\\nThe maritime colonies followed the example of Massachusetts, and,     when the United States by the act of August 7, 1789, accepted the,     title to, and joint jurisdiction over, the light-houses on the,     coast, and agreed to maintain them thereafter, they were eight in,     number, and comprised the following lights, all of which are still,     in existence, though so greatly improved that they are the same,     only in purpose and in site:\\n\\n\\\"We had better have this thing understood at the start, Sammy. When you, allowed that it was your business to hear whatever the keeper sent to, the inspector, it was all wrong, because if I want to make a report, privately, it ain't any concern of my assistants; but in this 'ere case, I have made you an' Uncle Zenas a part of the doc'ment, so to speak, an', that's why I'm explainin' matters.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Keepers are forbidden to engage in any business which can interfere, with their presence at their stations, or with the proper and timely, performance of their light-house duties; but it is no unusual thing to, find a keeper working at his station as a shoemaker, tailor, or in some, similar capacity, and there are light keepers who fill a neighboring, pulpit, who hold commissions as justice of the peace, and there are, still others who do duty as school teachers without neglecting their, light-houses.\\n\\nThere was an expression of deepest anxiety on Captain Eph's face as he, ascended the iron stairs, and on arriving at the floor above he stood, for a moment gazing at the childish face which could be seen amid the, mountain of bed-clothing, for in his desire to do all that might be, possible for the little fellow, Mr. Peters had piled upon the bed every, blanket and comfortable to be found in the tower.\\n\\n\\\"If you look back a page or two, Sonny, you'll find that the one burned, was built wholly of timber on the outside, and so was the top part of, the inside. This tower couldn't burn flat, bein' all stone, but the, rooms would have been pretty well cleaned out if you an' Sammy hadn't, worked mighty lively. We came off a good deal better than those poor, fellows did, an' Uncle Zenas can thank his lucky stars that it was, melted fat instead of lead which fell on him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As the fishing-boat could do nothing to quell the flames, it returned, to Plymouth to land the keepers; one, as soon as he got on shore, ran, away, it is supposed in a panic; the one burned by the melted lead was, sent to his own home for medical attendance; he was ninety-four years, old, but remarkably active considering his age. He told the doctor that, he had swallowed the molten lead, and that he could not be cured unless, it was removed. He lived until the twelfth day, when he suddenly, expired--the doctor opened his stomach, and found therein a solid oval, piece of lead weighing more than seven ounces.\\\"\\n\\nDown another flight, and the keeper was in a third circular room, where, were two beds. Another flight brought him to his own apartment, and, below that the kitchen, over which Uncle Zenas presided as cook and, second assistant light keeper, where everything was wondrously neat and, clean, and where every inch of space was economized for the better, keeping of the food, cooking utensils, and such articles as are, ordinarily found in similar apartments on shore.\\n\\n\\\"Early in the day, as the tide rose, the sea made a complete breach over, the rock, washing every movable thing away, and of the old dwelling not, one stone was left upon another. The new dwelling was flooded, and the, windows had to be secured to prevent the violence of the spray from, breaking them in. As the tide came, the sea rose higher and higher, till, the only endurable places were the light-towers. If they stood we were, saved, otherwise our fate was only too certain. But for some reason, I, know not why, I had no misgivings, and went on with my work as usual., For four weeks, owing to rough weather, no landing could be effected on, this rock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thought I'd gone crazy, eh?\\\" he cried as soon as it was possible for, him to speak. \\\"You an' Uncle Zenas have been figgerin' how you could get, me into the hospital, I s'pose? Crazy!\\\" and again the first assistant, laughed until he choked and gasped for breath. \\\"Let me tell you, Cap'n, Eph, that when I do go off the hooks you won't see me loafin' 'round, peaceable as this, for I'll think I'm in front of Petersburg again, an', cut up in a way that you can't call pleasant.\\\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later the keeper and his assistants were busily engaged on, their respective tasks. Captain Eph sat in the watch-room laboring over, his report; Uncle Zenas was cooking as if his very life depended upon, getting the largest amount of provisions prepared for eating in the, shortest possible space of time, and on the rocks Mr. Peters was, measuring and figuring on the shattered boat, confident that he could, soon put her in a seaworthy condition, provided he should be able to, find the proper material.\\n\\n\\\"The purpose of a light-ship is to do the work of a light-house in a, place where one is necessary, but where it has not been erected because, of the great difficulty, not to say expense, of such a structure. To, insure permanency of position is a matter of great difficulty. When, moorings have been made too heavy to drag, chains have broken; when they, have held, mooring-bitts have been torn out; when they have held, the, ship has foundered at her anchors, or the cable has been slipped, and, the ship has sought a harbor or gone to sea for safety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not? When a man comes as far as he has while a storm seems to be, brewin', it would kind'er be hard lines to hold him because Sammy was, off wreckin'. We'll load on the motor as soon as it can be done, an', send him back while the weather is decent, else he might be on our hands, quite a spell. People can't get out here at this time of year jest when, the fancy strikes 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It must be, Sonny, else he wouldn't act so kind of queer. All Cap'n Eph, an' I can figger out is that he got squeezed in some way between the, timbers of the raft, for it stands to reason he didn't put 'em together, very carefully. Oh Sonny, Sonny, if only I hadn't refused to give the, poor fellow his breakfast when he asked for it! Somehow I felt last, night as if it wasn't right for him to go off to the wreck alone, an', when he came down-stairs this mornin' reg'larly achin' to be off, I lost, my temper, an' that's the fact. The worst part of this world is that, after you say or do anythin' that's wrong or mean, you can't take it, back agin! Jest as likely as not he'd be in better shape now, if he'd, had a full stomach when he went away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I just sat there and cried, sir, till I remembered what father has, often told me, that when a boy, or a man, for that matter, loses his, courage, he is a great deal worse off than if he kept up his spirits. I, had often run the motor while the _West Wind_ was in port, and I tried, to make out how much gasolene there was in the tank, for I knew, steerage-way was needed, else I couldn't keep her head up into the wind., It was a terribly long while before day came again, and then the fog, covered everything so that I couldn't see very far in either direction., Of course father hunted for me; but I knew he didn't have much chance of, finding me in that kind of weather.\\\"\\n\\nAs Captain Eph had predicted, the storm subsided during the night, and, before breakfast had been eaten the clouds were being driven eastward by, the wind. The sea yet ran so high that the ledge was covered by the, waves a goodly portion of the time; but all the crew were positive that, within the next four and twenty hours it would be possible to make the, trip to the mainland in the dory, even though she carried the four, shipwrecked ones in addition to two of the keepers.\\n\\nThe first assistant led the way up through the one street of the, settlement as if he believed the new uniform he wore would cause a great, deal of excitement, and he was, in fact, the center of attraction while, he remained on shore, for even the children of the village had heard of, the three old cronies who kept the light on Carys' Ledge, holding to, their duties so closely as to visit the mainland no oftener than once in, two or three years.\\n\\n\\\"You can have anything I've got, Uncle Zenas, if it's to be used for, that lad. I don't understand why it is; but the little shaver has got, inter my heart mighty deep, even though he's only been here since, daylight,\\\" and the keeper gazed out into the fog as if he saw there a, picture of a \\\"little shaver\\\" who called him \\\"father\\\" many, many years, ago, but who now, with his mother, awaited the old man on the shores of, that golden river which neither pain, nor sorrow, nor sin can cross.\\n\\n\\\"In May the top of the rock was leveled and a foundation made about 88, feet above the sea, and, on the 31st, three masons, four derricks, a, small engine, and the appliances for laying the masonry, were landed., The stone, a fine grained, compact basalt, quarried near Portland and, cut to dimensions by contract, was delivered at Astoria and shipped to, the rock on the tender. The first cargo was landed on June 17; on the, 22nd the corner-stone was laid, and then the rest of the material was, shipped to the rock as the weather permitted.\\n\\n\\\"Captain Nutter of the _Nautilus_ reported to the Department, through, me, that you two men, at great peril to yourselves, saved the lives of, three of his crew and himself, all of whom would have unquestionably, been drowned but for your heroic exertions. The Light-House Board has, instructed me to say that they are proud to have such men in the, service, and I have here a letter of commendation. The Treasury, Department has sent these two gold medals on which are inscribed your, names and the service rendered, in token that the Government holds you, in especial esteem as brave men--such men as are needed in the, light-house service.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I started, Sonny, but hadn't got very far before I saw that I was, likely to lose some of my load unless it was looked after, so I ran the, bow of the dory up on the lumber, an' got out to make the heaviest, timbers fast. I reckon that in movin' 'round I tilted the side of the, raft down so the boat slipped off; but she was twenty yards away before, I knew what had happened. Of course I didn't suppose that the man would, come after the motor so soon, an' allowed that my only chance of ever, seein' Carys' Ledge agin was to catch the dory.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I'll eat the fish when they are caught,\\\" Mr. Peters exclaimed, indignantly. \\\"Do you suppose I'm that wasteful to let fresh cod spoil? I, haven't got anything agin folks goin' fishin', only when you come to, thinkin' that as soon as a storm springs up we'll be shut off from, workin' on the motor boat, it seems a good deal like wastin' time, since, we ain't really dyin' for need of that kind of food.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An' I called myself all kinds of an old villain for declarin' you, shouldn't have any breakfast, Sammy,\\\" Uncle Zenas said, his voice, tremulous with pain. \\\"I hope you won't lay it up agin me, for we've been, in danger too often to let anything come between us, an' when I get, so's I can stand on my feet, you may kick me all 'round this ledge at, low water.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't reckon you'd do yourself very proud by tryin' anything of the, kind, Sonny. In this 'ere smother it's a case of goin' by ear, an' I'll, pull up to the sound of the whistle, so make yourself comfortable in the, stern-sheets. The line you see there I laid out for you, an' it wouldn't, be a bad idee, if you want to be at work on somethin', to overhaul it., The bait is in this 'ere can amidships.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The iron ice-buoy is made of boiler-iron, and is divided into, compartments, so that any one may be pierced without sinking the buoy., One of the first-class costs $275, is fifty feet long, and stands, twenty-two feet out of water. One of the second-class costs $181, is, forty feet long, and stands seventeen feet out of water. As with wooden, spar-buoys, the ice passes over them without carrying them away; but\\n\\n\\\"Because I was so all-fired mean, Sonny, that is the reason. I saw that, Uncle Zenas was worryin' a good deal about me, an' made up my mind to, give him a good dose, so the next time I wanted to start away early he, wouldn't dare to say I shouldn't have breakfast till it was ready for, all hands. I fixed it with myself that I'd get up sometime this mornin'\\n\\n\\\"Well, go ahead. I reckon there ain't any such terrible great rush on, this 'ere boat, an' besides, as first assistant of the light, it's my, business to know what kind of a tale the keeper is sendin' to the, inspector,\\\" and Mr. Peters seated himself on the sharp edge of a rock in, token that he was prepared to listen; but Captain Eph said gravely, before beginning to read:\\n\\n\\\"Now don't get anythin' like that inter your head, Sonny, although I, allow there's reason for it. When I first came to Carys' Ledge, an' was, standin' watch on a night like this, it seemed certain the tower would, go by the board; but after a time I made myself understand that it was, almost as firm as the solid rock. Besides, not bein' so big as to offer, much resistance to the gale, I question if even a full-sized tornado, could harm it.\\\"\\n\\nWhen a lad is eager to be of assistance to those around him, there is, always ample opportunity, and during the remainder of this day Sidney, found something with which to occupy his time. More than once was he, able to render valuable service in the work of repairing the boat; Uncle, Zenas declared that the lad had \\\"helped him out wonderfully,\\\" and, Captain Eph discovered that the visitor's penmanship was very much more, legible than his own, therefore the \\\"report\\\" to the Board relative to, the coming of a boat belonging to the schooner _West Wind_ was copied, neatly, with much advantage, so far as the general appearance of the, document was concerned.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon it would take a mighty smart man to say that there'd been any, smoke in this 'ere lantern, an' now we'd better go down to see what the, poor fellows are needin'. I don't expect, Sonny, that you'll ever think, of me as anything except the meanest critter that ever walked the face, of the earth; but I'm askin' that you won't show it before the others., Life wouldn't be worth the livin', if they should know what I'd done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Early in the morning the fire was seen on shore, and a philanthropic, gentleman fitted out a fishing boat which arrived at the light-house at, 10 A.M. The fire had then been burning eight hours; the light keepers, had been driven from the tower, and, to avoid the falling timbers and, red-hot bolts, had taken refuge in the hole or cave on the east side of, the rocks under the iron ladder, near the landing.\\n\\n\\\"Keepers are trained to consider the care of the light and the, light-house property their paramount duty, beyond any personal, consideration; and the _esprit de corps_ is such that instances have, happened where the keepers on duty have, as in the case of the first, light on Minot's Ledge, gone down with their light-house and died at, their post; others, where the keeper has saved his lens, letting his, family shift for themselves; and there are repeated instances where the, keeper has saved his light-house property and lost his own.\\n\\n\\\"'In addition to this, the keepers had attached a five-and-a-half inch, hawser to the lantern deck, and anchored the other end to a granite, block, weighing, according to their account, seven tons, placed upon the, bottom at a distance of some fifty fathoms from the base of the tower., The object of this was to provide means for running a box or, landing-chair up and down; but it is very clear that so much surface, exposed to the moving sea had the same effect upon the light-house as, would have been produced by a number of men pulling at a rope attached, to the highest part of the structure, with the design of pulling it, down.\\n\\n\\\"See here, Sammy, there are times when you try a patient man like me, as, nobody has been tried since the days of Job. Of course I ain't tryin' to, keep any baby away from his own true an' lawful father, an' I called you, up here so's we could decide how to get word to the capt'n of the _West, Wind_ that his boy is here as safe an' snug as a bug in a rug.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Sonny, an' for two mighty good reasons. The first is that it's, goin' to blow hard inside of an hour, an' I'll need Uncle Zenas at one, pair of oars. Then agin, the place is not to be left alone, no matter, what straits we are in. Sammy would be the first to say we mustn't try, to help him if it can't be done without takin' the risk of showin' no, light at sunset. You'll be safe on the ledge, an' that's what I'm, thinkin' about.\\\"\\n\\nHe, with one of the men from the fisherman, had been sent out to set, trawls, and while they were thus engaged a white squall struck them. To, make any effort at battling against it was out of the question, and they, allowed their boat to drift before it, doing no more than to keep her, head on to the seas, believing the fishing schooner would be able to, pick them up.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon it wouldn't hurt very much if we broke the regerlations a, little bit, when perhaps there are lives to be saved,\\\" Mr. Peters, muttered as the keeper, raising the trap-door carefully, descended the, narrow, winding staircase, but the first assistant made no attempt to, follow his superior officer, because of knowing full well, from past, experience, that any such disobedience of orders would be followed by a, reprimand not pleasant to receive.\\n\\n\\\"Ay Sonny, sixteen of 'em either froze or went under before we got, there, an' two of these couldn't have lasted another half hour; but we, won't talk about that jest now. From the time Sammy an' me started, I, kept sayin' to myself that when we got back I'd take you in my arms, as, I've got you near an' hold you jest as long as you could stand it, for, you're gettin' to be a good part of my life, laddie.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On one such day this cataract carried away the supply-house, and even, endangered the quarters of the working party. For more than two weeks at, this time it was impossible for the steam-tender which supplied their, wants to cross the bar at the mouth of the Columbia River to go to their, assistance; when, after sixteen days, communication was reopened, the, party was found to be safe, but much in want of fresh provisions. These, were supplied by an endless line running between the mast of the, supply-vessel and a ring-bolt driven into the top of the rock, in, water-tight casks suspended from a traveler by slings, which was made to, move along the line.\\n\\nWhen the clock in the kitchen struck the hour of four, it was as if his, heart ceased beating, for he understood that even if the dory should, come in sight immediately, it would be impossible for the keepers to, reach the ledge before sunset, and he felt positive they would never, return. He would be the sole occupant of that lonely tower until the, inspector found an opportunity of visiting Carys' Ledge.\\n\\n\\\"You'll reach me then, Uncle Zenas, so long as you have your tongue, left,\\\" Captain Eph replied with a hearty laugh at his own wit as he went, hurriedly out of the tower, beckoning Sidney to follow. Not until the, lad had put on the coat made from the keeper's uniform would the cook, allow him to leave the kitchen, and by the time he gained the head of, the little cove, Mr. Peters had the dory ready for the voyage.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Sonny. She'd struck the shoal jest as I allowed, an' had driven up, on the rocks till the fo'c'sle deck was well out'er water, else never, one of the crew would have lived to talk about it. She was a big, barkentine--nigh to a thousand tons, I should say--breakin' up mighty, fast when we got there, with only four men left on deck, an' they so, covered with ice an' snow that you wouldn't have taken 'em for human, beings. They had a small gun, sich as is used for signalin', lashed to, the capstan; but were past firin' it when we hove in sight.\\\"\\n\\nAnd as the crew of the light-house thus discussed the possibility that, the signals of distress might have a terrible meaning for the lad whom, they had learned to love so well, the new day came slowly, revealing a, wind-lashed sea which rolled angrily over the ledge as if striving to, compass the destruction of the tower, while a dense veil of fleecy, particles, blown into wreaths and clouds by the gale, enveloped the, light-house as by a fog.\\n\\n\\\"Spar-buoys frequently lose a portion of their length, which is cut off, by strokes of colliding propeller-blades. Despite state and national, statutes forbidding it, vessels will sometimes make fast to buoys, thus, gradually dragging them off their bearings. A buoy has sometimes been, set adrift that a reward might be obtained for its recovery; but this is, not a profitable operation, as the reward paid is varied with the, circumstances of each case.\\n\\n\\\"If you'll go into my room an' get a book called _Ancient an' Modern, Light-Houses_, which was written by Major Heap of the Army, I'll show, you a story about the burnin' of the second Eddystone light--you, remember that the first was carried away by the sea,\\\" the keeper, replied, and believing it might cause the invalids to forget in some, slight degree their sad condition, Sidney went hurriedly for the book in, question, reading aloud, after Captain Eph had found the story, that, which is set down here:\\n\\nas him. An' the same holds good in my case. I wouldn't put my foot down, on the floor, to step any part of my weight on it, for the best hundred, dollars I ever heard tell about, an' you two couldn't carry me half-way, to my room. I've been thinkin' it all out, an' can't see any other, course than for Uncle Zenas an' me to stay where we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The buoy service has its own code of laws, State and national, a fleet, of small steamers for its maintenance, and a corps of contractors to, attend to the buoyage of coves and inlets impracticable to the steamers., It has its depots for the storage of iron buoys, where they are painted, and numbered, or repaired, and also where wooden buoys are made ready, for service. It has its own directory printed yearly, in thirteen, volumes, distributed gratuitously for the benefit of commerce, in which, each one is mentioned by name, located by station, and described by, size, color, number, and vicinity.\\n\\n\\\"It must be he's makin' for the ledge, an' it stands to reason we, ought'er lend him a hand. There, that's the last we'll see of the craft, unless some mighty fine steerin' is done, an' since it's no use lookin', out in the fog, Sammy, you'd better get to work on the lamp, while I go, down in case he's got brains enough to hold his course. Remember, that, 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations, the work of gettin' things, ship-shape must be begun immediately the light is put out, and we've, loafed too long already.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be in too big a hurry to pull me out, an' I'll get mighty near to, those fellows, if so be the dory strikes anywhere near where we're, expectin',\\\" Mr. Peters said as he came toward the window. \\\"We won't be, havin' any too much time, if I start now,\\\" and he stepped out of the, window, clutching the sill until the two at the rope were ready to lower, him away.\\n\\n\\\"Because I spoke the _West Wind_ two days ago. She had been cruising, around in search of the missing boat, and was only just put on her, course again when I met her. Captain Harlow asked me to have the fact of, the lad's being adrift in a motor boat inserted in all the leading, newspapers, offering a reward to any one who could give information, concerning the boy. He is bound for San Juan, and thence to Cadiz.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If they wasn't we shouldn't have sich lights in this country as we have, got. I ain't claimin' that we're the only nation on the face of the, earth who knows how to light a coast; but I will say, an' I've heard the, same from masters of foreign vessels, that we do the thing up brown, regardless of expense. Listen to rule 127, an' than I reckon it'll be, time to turn off the light: 'To clean reflectors, first dust them and, then rub with a buff-skin, lightly dusted with rouge powder, kept in a, small double bag of muslin; then rub lightly with another skin, and, finally with a third, which should be passed over the reflector in a, light, quick manner with a circular motion. Leakage of gas from the pipe, of the stove used in the watch-room should be carefully guarded against\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to fetch an' carry for this whole blessed crew, an' that at a, time when the fish-cakes are like to be burned to a cinder, I'll send in, a petition to the Board to have this 'ere stairway stretched till an, ordinary man can get through without scrapin' the skin all off his, shoulders,\\\" he said angrily, and Captain Eph replied, as he took the, glasses from the huge hand which was extended toward him:\\n\\n\\\"It was because of you that we tried to land here the other day; your, father had requested that you be taken from the ledge, and a, boarding-place be found for you on the mainland. Since having received, your letter, however, he telegraphed, yesterday, that you be allowed to, remain in the light until his return, and because of the assistance, which I learn you have rendered the keepers, I see no reason why the, Board will not grant his request.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When we found Sammy it looked to me as if he was pretty far gone; but, yet I took note of everything to be seen, with the hope of gettin' an, idee as to how the trouble came about. The top part of the raft was made, of heavy timbers, which appeared as if they'd been thrown there the last, thing because he'd seen that it would be jest as easy to take 'em along\\n\\n\\\"I ain't so certain 'bout that, though I'll admit that a man couldn't, keep his footin' there, an' 'tend to much of anything else; but the tide, is ebbin' now, an' it'll be within an hour of low water by the time that, 'ere dory gets here. I'm thinkin' you'll be able to see quite a bit of, Carys' Ledge by that time. Has Cap'n Eph made out anything new?\\\"\\n\\nThe great distinction between the later towers and their,     predecessors is that the stones of each course are dovetailed,     together laterally and vertically, so that the use of metal or,     wooden pins is needless. This method was first used at the Hanois,     Rock, Guernsey. On the upper face and at one end of each block is a,     dovetailed projection; and on the under face and at the other end,     is a dovetailed indentation. The upper and under dovetails are made,     just to fall into each other, and when the hydraulic cement is,     placed on the surface it so locks the dovetailing that the stones,     cannot be separated without breaking. Thus, when the cement is set,     and hardened, the whole of the base is literally one solid mass of,     granite. The lower courses for the first 39 feet of the Wolf Rock,     Light-house have fillets on their outer edges, into which the,     upper course is stepped, and this prevents the action of the waves,     from penetrating the joint.\\n\\n\\\"I'm goin' to tell you the whole story, Sonny, an' it shall be a secret, 'twixt you an' me. In the first place I was chafin' under the collar a, good bit when I left here to go to the wreck, after Uncle Zenas had, declared I shouldn't have a bite to eat till breakfast was ready. It, didn't seem jest the thing for him to make me go hungry because he was, set against my savin' what I could from the _Nautilus_, an' I'll leave, it to you if I wasn't right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We couldn't do the job without callin' all hands, an' I don't feel as, if I'd be doin' right to take any chances jest to save property. The sea, is breakin' over the ledge already, an' the rocks remainin' out of water, must be covered with snow an' ice. Go back to bed, Sammy, for, as you, know full well, we've got no right to stick our noses outside this, night. After daybreak, if she's still sound, we may be able to work, somethin' for her safety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Still increasing, it required but a slight increase in the height of, the waves, after having reached the deck, to bring it in contact with, the main body of the structure. When this took place it is plain to, perceive that such a sea, acting upon the surface of the building at the, end of a lever fifty or sixty feet long, must be well nigh, irresistible, and I doubt not that the light-house was thus destroyed.'\\n\\n\\\"Don't say a word, Sonny, or my courage won't hold out to tell the whole, of the story. Until about midnight I wasn't more'n half sensible of what, was goin' on; but after then I could have got up an' gone to work jest, as well as I can now, though I felt a bit lazy, an' considerable tired., I was jest mean enough to lay there in bed an' let you three stay on, watch all night, when there was nothin' to prevent my doin' a full share, of the duty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't count on bein' able to give you the idee as to the work of the, lenses sich as a man ought'er; but I'll try my best, an' if I fail you, won't be any worse off than you are now. In the first place this 'ere is, what is known as a light of the first order, meanin' the most powerful, in the service, an' the lens alone cost about eight thousand dollars., The middle part of the lens is made up of what's known as 'refractors,', which, 'cordin' to my way of tellin' it, are rings of glass makin' a, hollow cylinder six feet in diameter, an' thirty inches high. Below it\\n\\n\\\"I must be losin' my mind, to even imagine sich a thing!\\\" he exclaimed, petulantly, dashing the moisture from his eyes as if by so doing it, might be possible to penetrate the dense veil of vapor which shut out, from view even the tower of the light. \\\"It's a crazy trick for a grown, man to be whifflin' 'round here in this smother, without my thinkin' I, heard a boy. Hello-o-o-o!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wa'al, Sonny, I allow it ain't overly cheerful talk on a night like, this; but so long as it's in your mind I don't s'pose it'll make matters, seem worse if we go over the story. Nobody knows jest what time, on the, night of April 16th, the tower was carried away; but it's reasonable to, allow it was done about high water, which was an hour after midnight. It, was built on iron piles set into the rock, instead of bein' a solid, tower sich as are put up nowadays. I've heard them as should know, say, that keepers weren't held up to the rules an' regerlations as strict as, they are now, an' them as were in charge of Minot's Ledge Light had, built a platform well down below the livin' rooms, where they could stow, anything which it might not be convenient to keep inside. Here's what, the Government engineer, who was sent to look after the matter, said, about it,\\\" and Captain Eph, opening a book which lay near him, read the, following:\\n\\n\\\"Sonny,\\\" he cried, \\\"run up-stairs an' strip all the beds; bring the, clothes here, an' then help me rub these poor creeters down. Ephraim, Downs, you an' Sammy Peters are to get out of them wet duds jest as, quick as you know how, an' don't you dare let me see you liftin' a, finger till you're in dry clothes. I've had trouble enough about you, this day, without your gettin' all drawed up with rheumatiz jest for, spite. You're enough to wear a man down to skin an' bones, an' I've come, to that pass where I can't stand any more of your capers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've studied the rules an' regerlations ever since I was so, misfortunate as to be appointed second assistant keeper of this 'ere, light, an' so far I haven't found anything laid down agin answerin' the, keeper back when he tries to ride over a man. I allow you're in command, of the lantern, Captain Eph; but I've got some rights all to myself here, in the kitchen, an' there's goin' to be trouble if them as belong, up-stairs interfere while I'm 'tendin' to my reg'lar duties.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I had, I'd pull this 'ere dory all the way to the mainland for the, sake of reportin' 'em as a crew of lunatics what ought'er be locked, up before they drown themselves! It was some pleasure craft, manned by a, lot of idjuts who most likely think they are sailormen because of once, havin' sailed a toy boat in a wash-tub,\\\" and Captain Eph took up the, oars again. \\\"I reckon we'll let that put an end to our fishin' for this, day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The buoy's worst enemy, however, is ice, when moving in mass, and with, a tide or current. A well-made, well-moored buoy at the mouth of a, narrow river can create an ice-gorge; but usually, when the ice moves in, force, the buoys met have their mooring-loops torn out, their, mooring-chains broken, or their mooring-anchors weighed; and in each, case the buoys are carried out to sea, when the buoy tenders give chase\\n\\nBy this time Uncle Zenas had arrived at the scene, and, thanks to his, assistance, the little craft with her crew of one was pulled so far in, toward the rocks that the keeper and the cook had no difficulty in, running her bow on the ways, after which, as Mr. Peters scrambled out of, the water looking like a very large, half-drowned cat, the boy was taken, from the boat by Captain Eph.\\n\\n\\\"'Sir,--Finding ourselves at this moment in the most critical,    and dangerous condition, we hope that Providence will guide this,    letter to you, and that you will immediately come to our succor.,    Send to seek for us before spring, or we will perish, I fear;,    our supply of wood and water is almost exhausted, and our house,    is in the most sad state. We do not doubt that you would come to,    seek us as promptly as possible. We can be reached at high tide,    in almost any weather. I have no need to tell you more, you will,    comprehend our distress, and I remain\\n\\nAll hands stood watch during the night. Sidney felt positive he could, not close his eyes in slumber if he went to bed, and Captain Eph did not, urge him, understanding full well how the lad felt. Uncle Zenas claimed, that it was his right, because of what had happened in the morning, to, sit by the side of Mr. Peters, even though it might not be possible to, do him any good, and thus it was that the crew remained on duty, throughout the hours of darkness.\\n\\n\\\"Why should we? Ain't three of us enough for company? When all hands get, to loafin' 'round the kitchen I think it's reg'larly crowded. The fact, of the matter is, Sonny, we don't really have time for anything of that, kind. What with keepin' the place cleaned 'cordin' to the rules an', regerlations, an' doin' the odd chores, about all the time is so took up, we couldn't be lonesome if we wanted to; but we don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I allow it can be done without turnin' a hair. I'm predictin' a fair, day for to-morrow; but with a heavy sea runnin'. Four an' twenty hours, later it should be possible for Sammy an' me to make the mainland in the, dory. It'll take the best part of to-morrow for me to write out another, report as to the wreck, an' a letter to your father, so we'll be gettin', off about as soon as all hands are ready.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what we don't jest know, Sonny. We overtook the raft ten miles, or more from here, an' poor little Sammy was stretched out at full, length on it as if he was dead, with the waves washin' clean over him, every now an' then. It didn't take us long to find that there was some, little life left in his body, an' you can make up your mind that we, jumped it to the dory after takin' him aboard, for the only hope of, fetchin' him around was to get back here. Uncle Zenas an' I were feelin', mighty glum, as you can well guess; but there was a big lot of gladness, come inter our hearts when we saw the light streamin' out from Carys', Ledge, an' knew that the little shaver we'd left behind was bucklin', right down to duty.\\\"\\n\\nan' says to himself, says he: 'That's Carys' Ledge, an' I'll make the, course a leetle more southerly.' If that 'ere clock should happen to, break down on account of not bein' properly cared for, we'd have to take, turns grindin' a crank to keep the brass cylinder movin' up an' down, 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations, else there'd soon be another, ship piled up on the rocks alongside the _Nautilus_.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not so certain of that,\\\" Mr. Peters said as he examined the motor, carefully. \\\"Of course neither you nor me could set it up, because we, don't know how; but if it holds good weather I'm goin' to take it, ashore, an' put it in the hands of some man who understands his, business. If it's possible to get it in shape, I'll buy a hull, an' next, spring we can knock around out here like a couple of swells, with our, own yacht.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Number 125 is longer; but it ain't hard to catch the general idee of, it. 'When the light is extinguished in the morning the keeper must hang, the lantern curtains and immediately begin to put the apparatus in order, for relighting. While doing this the linen aprons provided for the, keeper's use must be worn, that the lens may not suffer from contact, with the wearing apparel. The illuminating apparatus must be carefully, covered before the cleaning is begun.' Now here's Sammy's apron for you\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, they managed to chisel out a kind of a hole at one side where, they could bolt some timbers to the solid foundation, an' cover them, with canvas. That was enough to give 'em a place to crawl into when the, sea ran too high; but look you, lad; I ain't certain that I'm tellin', this story straight, so supposin' we go back to the watch-room, an' I'll, give it to you set down in print, the same as I read it, then there, won't be any mistake.\\\"\\n\\nwhile he, with more brains in his little finger than the whole of us can, muster, comes up an' tells the facts. Of course that was why the tender, came out here, an' we'll see her again before many days. Sammy, I'm, goin' to make a try at gettin' up-stairs, so's there will be one bed, less in this kitchen, an' we'll see if things can't be pulled 'round as, they ought'er be 'cordin' to the rules an' regerlations.\\\"\\n\\nIn a twinkling the room was a scene of the greatest excitement. Captain, Eph, forgetting his injured limb, attempted to spring to his feet, but, sank back quickly with a groan, and Uncle Zenas, thinking only that the, inspector might not be pleased at seeing beds in the kitchen, bent over, to gather up the clothing, when the partially healed burns caused him to, straighten up again as a cry of pain escaped his lips.\\n\\n\\\"Now don't fret over that a little bit, Cap'n Eph,\\\" Mr. Peters cried, imploringly. \\\"It wouldn't hurt me any if I stood watch every night till, you an' Uncle Zenas got 'round agin; but Sonny has shown that he can, look after the light as well as either of us, an' he an' I will run, things slick as grease. He can go on watch till midnight, an' I'll take, the rest of the time, doin' all the cleanin' alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now I reckon we'll go inter the lantern,\\\" Uncle Zenas said when it was, no longer possible to distinguish the faces of those in the boat, owing, to the dim light. \\\"Cap'n Eph will keep his eyes on the light, an' if it, shouldn't happen to die away at the very minute when the sun ought'er, rise 'cordin' to his watch, the chances are he'd make all hands come, back to straighten us out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, look here, Cap'n Eph, there ain't any call for you to get up so, high on your ear,\\\" Mr. Peters interrupted. \\\"I wasn't allowin' it could, be anything but the truth, an' only spoke that way because there didn't, seem to be much else to say. We've got him here, an' are bound to take, care of him, no matter what the rules an' regerlations say about, boardin' or lodgin' houses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The men were stupefied, and the wind being from the east made a landing, extremely hazardous, if not impracticable. They, however, were saved by, the crew first anchoring the large boat, then a small boat was rowed, toward the rock, paying out a rope which was attached to the large boat;, when near enough to the rock a heaving-line was thrown to the men. Each, light keeper in turn fastened the rope around his waist, and, jumping, into the sea, was hauled into the boat.\\n\\nSidney was not particularly elated by the promise, since he believed the, motor was injured beyond repair; but Mr. Peters was so confident that, he talked of little else during the remainder of the day, and before, sunset even Uncle Zenas had begun to speculate upon the possibility of, owning a power boat, which might be housed on the mainland during the, winter season, when she could not be kept on the ledge.\\n\\nand the family ran short of food. Waiting until famine stared them in, the face, the son started in a little skiff equipped with a sail, made, by the aid of his sister, to obtain succor. Pushing from the rock in his, frail craft, he was at first lost sight of in the trough of the sea; he, reappeared on the top of the waves for a short distance, and was seen no, more for twenty-one days, during which time the mother and the four, girls were reduced to a cup of corn-meal and one egg each per day. Added, to risk of perishing of famine in mid-ocean, was the torturing suspense, as to the fate of father and son.\\n\\nSave for two rows of timbers securely bolted to the rocks, and extending, from the base of the tower to the water's edge to form \\\"ways,\\\" on which, a boat could be drawn up or launched, and a small hut not unlike the, dwelling of an Esquimau, made of cement, and large enough to shelter a, dory, there was nothing to be seen on the ledge of jagged rocks, over, which one could make his way only with considerable difficulty.\\n\\n\\\"Bless your heart, yes, Sonny. Many a vessel went ashore here before the, tower was built, an' we've had a wreck close at hand twice since, though, neither of the craft struck this ledge. If the weather is changin', as, Sammy says, it ain't very pleasant to be talkin' 'bout what's likely to, happen whenever the light can't be seen. Ain't it time for you to show, up your surprise, Sammy?\\\"\\n\\nThe theory of coast lighting is that each coast shall be so set,     with towers that the rays from their lights shall meet and pass,     each other, so that a vessel on the coast shall never be out of,     sight of a light, and that there shall be no dark places between,     lights. This is the theory upon which the United States is,     proceeding, and it plants lights where they are most needed upon,     those lines. Hence from year to year the length of the dark spaces,     on its coasts is lessened or expunged entirely, and the day will,     come when all its coasts will be defined from end to end by a band,     of lights by night, and by well-marked beacons by day.\\n\\n\\\"Wa'al, I can't say as to that, Sammy, seein's how we haven't had a, chance to send the letter ashore yet, and even if that was done, I, couldn't figure to any certainty on how long it would take to carry it, to Porto Rico. Of course I ought to know all about that, seein's I've, fished on the Banks, man and boy, for pretty nigh half my life; but yet, I don't. Somehow I'm afraid I ain't up in geography as I ought'er be., Any way, the first part of the work is done, meanin' the makin' of the, report, and now it stands us in hand to keep a bright lookout for a, craft that can be hailed.\\\"\\n\\nthe furious sea always prevented a landing. One of them returned one day, with a strange report. Its crew had seen a man, standing motionless, in, a corner of the exterior gallery. Near him floated a signal of distress., But was he dead or alive? No one could say. Each evening anxious looks, were cast at the light-house to see if its light would be shown, and, each evening it shone brightly, proof that some one was still there. But, were both keepers alive, and if there were but one who was the survivor?, This was learned later.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon, after thinkin' of all that, there ain't any one of this 'ere, crew as feels like complainin', eh?\\\" and Captain Eph looked around, sternly, much as though believing his assistants were on the verge of, insubordination. \\\"If a seventeen-year-old girl, with the same as, nothin' to eat, can take care of a whole family an' a light for, twenty-one days durin' heavy weather, we deserve to be kicked if there's, any show of gettin' down at the heel.\\\"\\n\\nand when so far distant from market as to make its carriage equal or, exceed its cost, with fuel and rations. Suitable boats are furnished, stations inaccessible by land; and at those stations on shore, distant, from markets, barns are built for their cattle and horses. Something, also has been done for the intellectual needs of the keepers and their, families by supplying them with libraries. These are arranged in cases, so constructed that they make rather a neat appearance when set upright, on a table, and they need only to be closed and locked to be ready for, transportation. They contain on an average about fifty volumes each. One, of these libraries is left at a station for some three months, when it, is exchanged and passed on to another station. This is usually done when, the inspector makes his quarterly inspection; so each of the stations to, which libraries are furnished sees some two hundred different books each, year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, Sonny, is the hard part of explainin' the business, because I, don't know so much about it as I ought'er; but I've heard the inspector, talk somethin' like this: The flame of the lamp sends its rays in all, directions--up, down, an' sideways; an' what's wanted is to get the, light streamin' out in a straight line all around, so the top an' bottom, of this 'ere glass cage is put on to bend the rays till they go in the, same direction as those in the middle of the flame. 'Cordin' to the, inspector, when a ray of light strikes a prism of glass, it turns toward, the base, as you'll see in this--wa'al, I don't hardly know what to call, it--that I've been drawin' so's you'll understand what the inspector, means by bendin' the rays. You'll notice that, except in the middle, the, prisms are each set at a different angle, an' with a space between 'em\\n\\n\\\"Bless your soul, Sonny, you'd be of use if you didn't do more than let, us old shell-backs look at you,\\\" and Captain Eph seated himself in the, chair, rocking the lad as if he had been a baby. \\\"You never can know how, much good it has done us to have you here. If it wasn't for the sore, heart I know your father has this minute, I'd thank God you got lost in, the fog, an' pray that you might never find your way off this 'ere ledge, so long as I lived.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It don't stand to reason he could hold his course long enough to hit, this 'ere ledge; but I reckon it's my duty as a Christian man an' a, light keeper to do what I can toward lendin' a hand. If he don't come, ashore here, the chances are mightily agin his strikin' land while the, breath is left in his body, for this 'ere smother is enough to mix up, anybody except an old shellback like me. Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd have been willin' to staid there, an' it was what I wanted to do,\\\", Uncle Zenas replied breathlessly, as he tried unsuccessfully to lower, his huge body through the narrow aperture. \\\"If the crew of this 'ere, light hadn't been so desperately lazy that they couldn't come down after, a little pair of glasses, we wouldn't be losin' the best mess of, fish-cakes that was ever put together on Carys' Ledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay, lad, but he came up within reach of the wreckage we went out to, look at. Again and again I yelled while you were cruising around, expecting to see me come to the surface near where I had disappeared;, but you didn't hear me, and then the fog shut down again. I gave myself, up for lost; but within an hour two fishermen in a dory blundered, along, and took me to their vessel three or four miles away. There was, no such thing as finding the _West Wind_ while the sea was covered with, fog so thick that it could almost be cut with a knife, and I've served, an apprenticeship as fisherman, eating my heart out because the skipper, wouldn't put into port until he had a full fare.\\\"\\n\\nDespite the protests of the shipwrecked men, they were sent to sleep in, the room used by the assistants. Uncle Zenas laid down a pile of, blankets in the kitchen for his couch, and the same kind of a bed was, made for Sidney in the watch-room, he begging for the privilege of, remaining there during the night, to the end that Mr. Peters and Captain, Eph might use the keeper's room.\\n\\n\\\"He's got to find a vessel bound for that port, an' then coax the cap'n, into givin' him a passage, all of which takes time. It don't stand to, reason, Sonny, that he'll get there, an' your messages can be sent in a, reg'lar letter, for of course your father wrote you an' me 'bout the, same time he telegraphed to the inspector. It seems to me everything has, come 'round jest as we'd like to have it, an' you're to stay here with, us!\\\"\\n\\nThe cook was brimming over with curiosity as to the nature of the, surprise which Mr. Peters had in store for them, and Captain Eph, confessed that he was \\\"all in the dark\\\"; but, remembering the shape of, some of the packages the first assistant brought with him, and his fear, lest they should get wet, Sidney believed he could make a very good, guess as to what was coming.\\n\\n\\\"I've been expectin' you'd ask that same question jest as soon as you'd, got well inter this 'ere light-house business, an' it strikes me you'll, know more about it by readin' somethin' I've put by here, than if I, spent the whole day tryin' to tell it in my clumsy way,\\\" the keeper said, as he gave to Sidney an open book, from which the lad read that which, follows:\\n\\n\\\"When you have the time there's nothin' to hinder your readin' what the, Board says about whistlin' buoys; but I won't promise that you'll be any, the wiser after doin' it, for in all these years I haven't been able to, get it through my head, though I've figgered out a gen'ral idee of how, she works. The top of the buoy is shaped a good deal like a pear, an', measures about twelve feet across the widest part. Inside the upper, part, an' runnin' down into the sea to a depth of thirty-two feet, is an, iron pipe thirty-three inches across it. Right at the very top of the, pipe, an' showin' above the whole thing, is a 10-inch locomotive, whistle, connected with some little tubes, which the inspector says make, a piston-and cylinder movement, whatever that may be.\\n\\n\\\"I allow there's a good chance for an argument there, Cap'n Eph; but, seein's how we're kind'er pressed for time, we'll let the matter drop a, spell, an' take it up when there's nothin' else on hand, I mean about, your havin' the right to make a report without my knowin' what's in it., Go ahead with the readin' an' then I'll explain how I count on fixin' up, Sonny's boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's no use talkin', Uncle Zenas, you lay way over anybody I ever, saw when it comes to cookin,' an' this 'ere lay-out is fit for the best, king that ever lived,\\\" the first assistant said approvingly, as he, applied himself industriously to getting a full share of all that had, been placed before him. \\\"It's growin' cold mighty fast, an' gives a man, quite an appetite to loaf around on the ledge only about half dressed.\\\"\\n\\nbecause she hasn't been on the station more'n two years. I don't claim, to be anything of a coward in seafarin' matters; but I never wanted any, part of a light-ship in weather like this. Let's have a look around the, lantern, lad. If a body don't feel jest right in mind, it's a good idee, to move about a bit, instead of stayin' in one place listenin', for the, wind does contrive to make some mighty queer noises.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then this is the way I look at the sitewation, Captain Eph,\\\" the first, assistant began, waving his knife in the air as if to attract attention., \\\"This 'ere fog mull may hang on for a week or ten days, an' since I've, been on the ledge I've known the smother to last a full two weeks, without liftin' enough to show a man the end of his own nose. It stands, to reason we can't hail any craft that we ain't able to see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Meantime the keepers of another light-house, fearing the ice, had, deserted their post, and gone on shore. The fact that no vessels could, have needed their lights while the ice remained unbroken, and that they, returned to their post when the danger had passed, did not avail them., So soon as the fact of their desertion was determined they were, dismissed the service, and the two keepers who had spent those terrible, hours afloat in Sharp's Island light-house, and then saved its, apparatus, were highly complimented by a letter direct from the Board, itself, and then were appointed to the deserters' places.\\n\\n\\\"After setting up the main derrick and cutting a pathway up the face of, the rock, they opened a bench around it by suspending the workmen on, staging supported by bolts let into the rock's crest. The bench once, formed, the reduction was pushed to the center. The outer surface of the, rock was easily removed with moderate charges of black powder, but the, nucleus was hard and firm, and giant powder was necessary to open the, mass, when large charges of black powder acted satisfactorily.\\n\\n\\\"I never think I'd like to be in the life-savin' service except at sich, a time as this,\\\" he said as he returned to the table. \\\"Even if the crew, can't really do anything, there must be a good deal of satisfaction in, makin' a big fight for it; but to be shut in a place like this, knowin', what's goin' on outside, gets on to a man's nerves worse'n anything I, ever struck. A hot battle ain't a marker alongside of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We bought what Sammy an' me both allowed was the proper kind of an, outfit for a boy who counted on spendin' the winter on Carys' Ledge, an', you'd seen the whole lot by this time, if you hadn't been in sich a, pucker for us to come to dinner,\\\" Captain Eph replied, much as if he, felt in some way injured because the meal had been served so promptly.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon we'll have to finish this 'ere talk some other time, for Uncle, Zenas does surely seem to be gettin' nervous. He's a mighty handy man, 'round a light-house; but I do wish he'd get over bein' so dreadful, particular about all hands settin' down to the table the very instant a, meal is ready. There are times, like this, when I'd rather linger a, little; but I don't dare to on account of his bein' so particular.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course these 'ere buoys are anchored in deep water, an' it stands to, reason that they rise an' fall on the waves, consequently the water, inside the big pipe pumps up an' down, compressin' the air till it jest, nat'rally has to escape through the whistle, makin' the noise. The whole, thing was invented by a man named Courtenay, an' I'm bound to say he, must have had a big head on his shoulders to think out sich a, contrivance. It may be, lad, that you'll understand it better by readin', from the report; but I can't tackle the big words, an' don't know a, piston or an apex from the Queen of Sheba, consequently it don't do me, any great amount of good to puzzle over 'em.\\n\\n\\\"Sammy!\\\" Captain Eph cried sharply. \\\"What do you mean by runnin', yourself down like that? Uncle Zenas an' I have summered an' wintered, with you, an' know there ain't a mean bone in your body, so don't let's, hear any more 'bout your bein' to blame for what happened this day. If I, hadn't yelled so loud, the fat wouldn't have been spilled, an' then I, shouldn't have blundered down-stairs like an old fool.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'At 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, the 16th, or ten hours before the, light fell, the platform above mentioned came ashore at Cohasset. As, this was forty-three feet above the line of low water, and twenty-eight, feet above high water, spring tides, the sea had at that time reached, within seven feet of the base of the store-room of the light-house., Without undertaking to speculate upon the probable shock that the, structure must have received from the effect of the sea upon a platform, fastened to the piles forty feet above the rock, it is enough to know, that the sea had reached within seven feet of the body or solid part of, the structure.\\n\\nan' there'll be no harm done if you don't hear what he's got to say for, two weeks to come. S'posen he's sent a message, which I don't believe he, has, for you to come to Porto Rico, what good would it do you to know, it, seein's how you can't get off this 'ere ledge till the sea goes, down? It's foolish to fret over what can't be helped. Tell me, did you, ever hear of a light called Barnegat?\\\"\\n\\nHere he found nothing contrary to the opinion he and his first assistant, had already formed--that she had been built as a tender to a large, vessel. A gasoline motor of 3 horse-power, with the appearance of having, been well cared for, was aft where the helmsman could attend to it while, holding the boat on her course, and lashed on either side inboard were, oars and spare fittings. Everything about the craft told that she had, lately been looked after by sailormen, and, having ascertained this, much, Captain Eph set about learning how seriously she had been damaged, by the rocks.\\n\\n\\\"I had lumber enough to make a hundred oars, but no tools with which to, put 'em in shape. I got out a piece of plankin', usin' my foot as a, thole-pin, an' in that way got the raft workin' more favorably in the, wind; but I couldn't raise the plank high enough out of the water. A big, wave caught the outer end, an' then I got sich a clip on the stomach as, knocked me silly. It looked as if I was pretty nigh my last gasp, an', jest then a sea swept me clean off the timbers. It's a solemn fact\\n\\nThe second assistant was by no means satisfied with this statement. He, declared that if the medals were not to be worn daily, they should at, least be kept where visitors would be certain to see them, and, threatened that, unless some arrangement of that kind were made, he, would resign his position of second assistant without delay, \\\"rather, than stay 'round with a couple of idjuts who didn't know enough to, spread themselves when they had the chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Government has got eighty-eight whistling buoys in position, an', every blessed one of 'em cost nigh to eleven hundred dollars. Then there, are one hundred an' thirty-nine bell-buoys which cost three hundred, dollars apiece, an' five thousand one hundred an' eighty-three other, buoys costin' different prices, so you see, lad, that outside the, light-house part of the service, it takes a big pile of money to buy, buoys an' keep 'em in position.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
