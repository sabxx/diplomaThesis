But in the midst of the intense, silence of the night better sense began to prevail.\\n\\nA hundred yards farther along the narrow ledge--a fault in the strata, which formed that side of the lake--and all doubt of their being at the, exit of the waters was at rest, for Melchior stopped short where the, ledge widened into a little platform at the angle of the rock forming, one of the sides of a mere crack in the titanic wall of perpendicular, mountain, which in places actually overhung them, and ran up fully a, thousand feet.\\n\\nIt never occurred to him that they could render no help, even if they, did catch sight of their unfortunate companion; for they were never less, than twenty feet above the narrow hissing and roaring stream, and there, was not a spot where a rock could be grasped: everything was worn too, smooth by the constant passage of the water, which doubtless carried, with it stones from the lake as well as those ever loosened by frost and, crumbling down from above, to aid in grinding the walls quite smooth.\\n\\nSaxe stood gazing upward with a feeling of awe creeping over him.  There, was no mistake about height here.  The line of snow, which ended as, quickly as if it had been cut square at one end, seemed terribly far, away; and Saxe was thinking that it seemed almost madness to try and, reach such a spot, when Melchior drew his attention to first one and, then another flake of ruddy light in the distance.\\n\\nFar below him as he fell he heard the snow and ice he had broken away go, hissing and whispering down for what seemed long after he had dropped;, and this gave him some idea of the terrible depth of the ice crack, and, a cold chill, that was not caused by the icy coldness of the place, ran, through him, as he wondered whether the rope, which now looked thin and, worn, would hold.  Then he thought that it might possibly cut against, the sharp edge, and after a sharp glance upward, to see nothing but the, blue sky, he could not keep from looking down into the black depths and, listening to the faint musical gurgle of running water.\\n\\nThe light was dying out fast on the peaks around, and they ceased to, flash and glow, to become pale and grey, and then ghastly, cold and, strange, as the little party sat enjoying the simple meal and the calm, and rest of the peaceful scene.  Everything around was so still that, there was hardly a murmur in the pines; only the hushed roar of the, restless river, but subdued now, for its waters were shrinking fast from, the failure of the supply; for the many thousand trickling rivulets of, melting snow, born of the hot sunshine of the day, were now being frozen, up hard.\\n\\nThen he shaded his eyes and gazed downward beneath the labyrinth of ice, blocks among which the smoother ice which had formed their path wound, its way; but for a long time he could see nothing of Dale, and he was, beginning to ask himself whether it was fancy, when there was another, hail, and soon after he caught sight of Dale's head and shoulders as he, climbed up the icy slope, and saw that the new rope was across his, breast.\\n\\nStrange places bring strange dreams, and often some hours of complete, oblivion.  Saxe began to dream with all his might.  Body and Brain had, been having the thorough rest which comes to those who have been walking, far in the glorious mountain air; but toward morning Brain woke up and, began to act on its own account, while Body lay asleep; and when Brain, does this without the balance given by Body, its workings are rather, wild.\\n\\nThe night passed quietly enough.  It was cold; and, at the height they, had reached, the stars shone out frostily; but the sleep was deliriously, refreshing, and Saxe rose the next morning ready for a journey to the, Black Ravine.  The mule was taken to carry back any specimens that they, might decide to bring away, and the goat insisted upon following, having, apparently no intention of being left alone, and setting Gros an, excellent example in climbing.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr--not for many hours: we must not wait for that;\\\" and he knelt, down now, and after rapidly chafing the half-dead limbs to bring back, the circulation, he took string from his pocket, cut off both sleeves of, his jacket, and then cleverly tied the wrists, and drew them on to the, boy's legs, where he bound them with the string, forming a pair of boots, and stockings in one.\\n\\nIn this position its head was in shelter, but the rain streamed down, upon its back and hind quarters, while a perfect deluge, like that from, a waterspout, ran down a long gully in the overhanging rock right on to, the spine just between the shoulders, and there divided to trickle on, either side down the fore legs, and then run down through the pine, needles, which formed too thick a bed for any of the water to make a, pool.\\n\\n\\\"Not so very deep,\\\" cried Saxe, as he prepared to throw down the other, piece; and, moving a few yards farther along towards the centre of the, glacier, he had poised the lump of ice in his hands, when there came a, peculiar hissing, whishing sound from far below and he shrank back, wondering, till it came to him by degrees that the piece he had thrown, down must have struck upon some ledge, shattered to fragments, and that, these pieces had gone on falling, till the hissing noise he had heard, was caused by their disappearing into water at some awful depth below.\\n\\n\\\"I'll believe in the bear before I believe in the gnome or kobold!\\\", cried Dale.  \\\"Oh, Melchior! now I have so far had so much respect for, you as a frank, manly Switzer, don't spoil it by trying to cloak an, error with a paltry excuse.  You did not properly secure the rope; it, came off; and it was an accident.  You know it was an accident, so let, it rest.\\\"\\n\\nThey had just turned the corner of a huge buttress of rock, and Dale, pointed up the valley to the wonderful panorama of mountain and glacier, which suddenly burst upon their view.  Snowy peak rising behind green, alps dotted with cattle, and beyond the glittering peak other pyramids, and spires of ice with cols and hollows full of unsullied snow, like, huge waves suddenly frozen, with their ridges, ripples, and curves, preserved.\\n\\n\\\"Nein--nein--nein--nein!\\\" shouted the old Swiss, and the donkey's bray, died off into a sobbing moan.  As this was ended, the old man jodelled, again, apparently without result; but soon after there was a snort, and, a peculiar-looking animal came trotting down from the mountain, whisking, its long tail from side to side and pointing its long ears forward.  But, as it came close up, it suddenly stopped, and spun round as if upon a, pivot.\\n\\nA month later, after a warm parting from old Andregg and his wife, who, made her apron quite wet with tears, and insisted upon presenting Saxe, with a very nasty-smelling cheese of her own make, the little party, journeyed back through the various valleys, and on to the lovely lake of, deep waters, where the mountains rose up like walls on either side, and, then on and on to Waldberg, whence they were to start next day for home.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and you may hear every Swiss mountaineer we meet do that.  You, hailed him, and the man answered, and he is coming toward us,\\\" continued, Dale, straining his eyes again to watch the slowly approaching figure., \\\"Bah!  How absurd!  I'm as bad as the sailor who put his cutlass into, his left hand, so that he could have his right free to knock an enemy, down with his fist.\\\"\\n\\nevidently meaning to land upon the projection he had occupied so long., But after several trials he found that he had not sufficient length of, rope for this, and he had to lower himself a little more, showing the, while the most implicit confidence in the rope as he began to swing, again, describing a larger and a larger arc, till he checked himself, when farthest distant from Saxe, upon a projection which just gave him, room enough to stand on a level with Saxe.\\n\\nHe was not long kept in doubt, for the party, whoever they were, came on, rapidly now, at the sight of the fire, the dim lanthorns dancing and, swinging about in the darkness below, and coming nearer and nearer, as, their bearers ascended the mountain side towards the patch of wood, till, all at once one of them came forward at a run into the light shed by the, fire.\\n\\nCertainly they seemed at liberty, for he threw them out so vigorously, that, as Saxe gazed at the hoofs playing about in the air, they seemed, to be sparring and fencing at him, while the tail between whipped and, whisked about, and ended by tucking itself in tightly, till Saxe sat, down on a rock roaring with laughter, when the mule suddenly ceased its, efforts, stood still, and turned its head round to watch him.\\n\\nHe was close upon it now, and, holding the light well up with his left, hand, he was in the act of turning the corner, when something moved out, of the darkness on the other side, and Saxe stood once more petrified, with horror as the light fell upon the huge face he had seen in the, night, but hideously distorted, and with the glowing bloodshot eyes, within six inches of his own.\\n\\nA good long look was taken at the various magnificent specimens before, they were laid together.  Then Melchior busied himself helping to, prepare the meal; and very shortly after this was ended, watching being, deemed unnecessary, the whole party were sleeping soundly, not one of, them, after the heavy toil of the day, being startled by the loud, squealing whinny given by the mule toward the middle of the night.\\n\\nand against this the whole body of water was propelled, to strike, straight upon it, and rise up like a billow of the sea and fall back, with a furious roar.  Here the foam formed so dense a mist that Dale had, crept right into it before he realised that, as the water fell back, it, shot away through the gloom to his left, forming a fresh billow against, a perpendicular wall before it again darted onward.\\n\\nand can show me how they are made of different stone, which is always, being ground down to come into the valleys to make them rich.  I know, all this, herr; and so I do not wonder and doubt when you ask me to show, you some of the wildest places in the mountains, where you may find, crystals and see glaciers and caves scarcely any of us have ventured to, search.  But if I told some of our people that you spend your money and, your time in seeking and examining all this, they would only laugh and, call me a fool.  They would say, `we know better.  He has blinded you., He is seeking for gold and diamonds.'  And I could not make them believe, it is all in the pursuit of--what do you call that!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is more than any one can understand, Saxe,\\\" said Dale quietly; \\\"and, yet, while it is grand beyond imagination, all the scheme of these, mountains, with their ice and snow, is gloriously simple.  Yes,\\\" he, added, with a nod to Melchior, \\\"go on,\\\" and an arduous climb followed, along the ridge of rocks, while the sun was reflected with a painful, glare from the snowfield on their left, a gloriously soft curve of, perhaps great depth kept from gliding down into the gorge below by the, ridge of rocks along which they climbed.\\n\\nThe way was safe enough, save here and there, when Melchior led them, along a ledge from which the slope down was so steep as to be almost a, precipice.  But here he always paused and drew in the rope till those in, his charge were close up to him; and on one of these occasions he patted, Saxe on the shoulder, for there had been a narrow piece of about fifty, feet in length that looked worse at a glance back than in the passing.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the boy shortly; and for the next hour they tramped over, snow like hailstones, and then zigzagged up a slope beyond it, where in, the steepest places a little cutting became necessary; but this was all, mastered in time, and the shoulder was reached, from which half a mile, away the final peak arose--a blunt hillock with perfectly smooth snow on, one side, bare rock, broken and rugged, on the other, while the snow at, the top seemed to have been cut clean off perpendicularly.\\n\\nThe meal, though, was not altogether pleasant to Saxe, who found that, every time he raised his eyes Pierre was staring at him in the peculiar, apathetic way which had irritated him so before.  No matter how he, changed his position, no matter what he did, the feeling was strong upon, him that old Andregg's servant was watching him; and the stronger this, idea grew upon him the more he felt compelled to turn and look back\\n\\n\\\"You wanted guides to the mountains, and we showed you the way, while, you taught us that we could climb too, and could be as cool and daring., We did not know it before, and we had to get over our suspicions.  For, we said, `these strangers must want to find something in the mountains--, something that will pay them for the risk they run in climbing up to the, places where the demons of the storm dwell, and who wait to hurl down, stones and dart lightning at the daring people who would venture up into, their homes.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I always feel, herrs, when I have had to do with an accident, that I, have been in fault, and that I have to examine myself as to what I had, left undone; but here I cannot see that I neglected anything.  The, crevasse was not wide.  I had seen you both leap in safety, and I, followed.  It was one of the misfortunes that happen to people, whether, they are mountaineers or quiet dwellers in the valley.\\\"\\n\\nThis time he got himself down lower, and his arms so far round Saxe that, he was able to hook his hands about his elbows.  Then, slowly bringing, his great strength to bear, he began to heave, the veins standing out, like network about his temples, and his face turning purple as he strove, to draw the prisoner out of the icy fetters in which he was fast.  But, for some moments every effort seemed to be vain, and a horrible feeling, of despair came over the guide as he relaxed his efforts once more.\\n\\n\\\"Saxifrages.  There are any number of them about here, from some so tiny, you can hardly see them to others with great bell flowers and broad, leaves.  I'm afraid if you went to the tropics Saxe, you would find, fault with the plants there, because you had seen so many of them at, home in England.  Now, let's sit down and rest here, and look at the, mountains!  I never tire of watching their snow peaks, ridges and, hollows, with their dazzling snow.\\\"\\n\\nThe snow was cold beneath him, and the sun poured down upon his back, with blistering power, but the boy felt nothing save the despairing, agony of mind; and as he lay there one desire, one wish came to his, mind, and that was full of longing for forgetfulness--the power to put, all this terrible trouble behind him--a miserable feeling of cowardice:, in short, of desire to evade his share of the cares of life, which come, to all: for he had yet to learn what is the whole duty of a man.\\n\\nThen onward slowly for hours--at times in the valley, where their feet, crushed the beautiful tufts of ferns; then the hoofs of the mule were, clattering over rounded masses of stone, ground and polished, over which, the patient beast slipped and slid, but never went down.  Now and then, there was a glimpse of a peak here or of another turning or rift there;, but for the most part they were completely shut in down between walls of, rock, which echoed their voices, bursting forth into quite an answering, chorus when Melchior gave forth a loud, melodious jodel.\\n\\nA pleasant, drowsy sensation began to steal over him, and he was about, to give way to it, when the idea came like a flash that it would be idle, and cowardly; and this thought made him spring up, and fold the rug in, which he had been rolled; and after a glance at where Mr Dale still, slept, he went softly out of the clump of trees in the direction where, he could hear the crackling, to find Melchior in the act of placing the, tin kettle they had brought upon the fire.\\n\\n\\\"The young herr shall see,\\\" replied the guide.  \\\"Ah! there is Andregg., The cows have just been brought home, and here come the goats.  I heard, the cry in the mountains.  We shall have bread and milk and cheese, if, we have nothing else.  Do I believe that about the demons who guard the, crystal caves?\\\" he continued thoughtfully.  \\\"Well, the young herr shall, see.  Hoi! hola, Andregg!  I bring you friends!\\\" he shouted to a, grey-haired man standing in the evening twilight, which was declining, fast, just outside the plain brown pine-wood chalet, with two women and, a boy leisurely milking cows and goats.\\n\\nlooking up at the rocky sides of the valley, which grew more and more, snow-clad as they went on, and giving himself greater trouble by missing, the footsteps of his leaders.  Once he nearly stumbled and fell, giving, a jerk to the rope; but he recovered himself directly, and tramped on in, silence, finding the going so arduous that he began to wish for the time, when they would leave the glacier and take to the rocks.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr.  How could man live up here in these solitudes?  It is bright, and beautiful now, with moss and dwarf firs and ferns; but food would, not grow here.  Then there is no grass for the cattle; and in the winter, it is all deep in snow, and the winds tear down these valleys, so that, it is only in sheltered places that the pines can stand.  Am I leading, the herrs right?  Is this the kind of scenery they wish to see?\\\"\\n\\nwhen he opened his eyes to find that he was the last to wake up, that, the fire was burning merrily, the sun shining, and nature looking more, beautiful than ever.  They were evidently waiting for him to wake and, join them, for the rough meal was spread and the party talking quietly--, all but Pierre, who lay on the ground upon his chest, resting his chin, in his hands, and staring hard in one direction with his heavy\\n\\nBut even this came to an end; for, refreshed by the food, and after, submitting to an examination by Melchior, who wished to make sure that, his feet were not frozen in the least, a peculiar sensation of drowsy, warmth came over the boy so strongly, that one minute he was trying to, paint his sufferings on the snow when he felt that he had lost Dale, the, next he was lying back wrapped in a blanket, breathing hard and sleeping, as soundly in that dwarf pine-wood on the ledge of the huge mountain as, if he had been back in London, with policemen regularly parading the, street outside.\\n\\nSaxe felt a catching sensation at the breast, a tingling in the temples, and cheeks, as if his veins were startled and his blood running wild;, and he stole his hand softly out from under the rug, to try and reach, his companions and rouse them to a sense of the impending danger--trying, to recollect at the same moment where the ice-axes had been placed when, they lay down overnight.\\n\\nIt had now become such a matter of course to rise at these nocturnal, hours for long expeditions, that Saxe turned out at once, with nothing, more than a growl or two and a vicious snatch at his clothes.  The cold, water and the coffee, however, soon set him right, and at two punctually, the trio were on their way along the valley, with the last quarter of, the moon to light them as they struck up close by the end of the lower, glacier, and then went on and on at a steady rate toward the great giant, whose pyramidal peak could be faintly discerned in the distance, looking, to Saxe terribly far off, and as if it would be impossible to reach the, top that day.  But their guide had cunning ways for shortening the, distance, leading them round this outer buttress, up that ravine, and in, and out and along shelves, so that, by the time the sun rose, they had, well mastered the outworks, and were ready to attack the peak itself.\\n\\nThe boy set his teeth, his brow furrowed, and there were marks about his, eyes, as he saw Dale throw the rope round the handle of the ice-axe, and, then over the coil, so that the rings of rope should come off freely., Then he grasped the hemp firmly with one hand, his ice-axe with the, other, and threw back his legs over the edge of the crevasse close to, where the great piece had broken away.  As he did this a piece of snow, slipped from under his chest, and went down before him and he was over, the side, swinging gently to and fro, as he heard a spattering noise, come from below.\\n\\nThis vast glacier had also shrunk, leaving from ten to twenty feet of, smoothly polished rock at the side--that is, at the foot of the, precipitous gorge down which it ran--and thus forming a comparatively, easy path for the travellers, who climbed upwards over the rounded, masses, stopping from time to time where the ice curved over, leaving, spaces between it and its rocky bed, down which Saxe gazed into a deep, blue dimness, and listened to the murmuring roar of many waters coursing, along beneath.\\n\\nThe effect of those falls was wonderful, and for the first few minutes, it seemed as if the water had just awakened at its various sources, and, was in no hurry to join the mad, impetuous stream below, so slowly it, dropped, turning into spray, which grew more and more misty as it, descended, while every now and then a jet as of silver rockets shot over, from the top, head and tail being exactly defined, but of course in, water instead of sparks.\\n\\nThe sun was now getting so low down that the great ragged pyramids and, crags of ice cast fantastic shadows eastward.  There was a deep orange, glow in the sky, and at another time they would have stopped enchanted, by the dazzling beauty of the effects before them; but now Saxe could, see nothing but the pale face of their guide, as he lay far below with, his staring eyes fixed upon the narrow rift beyond which was the evening, sky; and at such times as the boy conjured up this ghastly picture in, his brain, his eyes grew misty, and he stumbled and slipped upon the, rugged ice which formed their way.\\n\\n\\\"I can't make a fuss about it and complain,\\\" he said to himself: \\\"it, would seem to be so stupid.\\\"  For what could he say, save that the man, stared at him in a dull, heavy way?  Dale would reply that there was no, harm in that, and he would look weak.  But all the same the man's stare, worried him and spoiled his breakfast, making him feel irritable and, morose all the way back, till they reached Andregg's home in the valley\\n\\nwhich grew more and more rapid and delightful.  Every sense of weariness, was gone, and he was just thinking of lammergeyers in their flight, when, he heard his companions shouting to him, just as he lost his balance and, came down on his side.  Then, he lost his alpenstock and directly after, his temper, as he found he was rolling down head first till he gave, himself a tremendous wrench, and contrived to get his feet foremost\\n\\nherrs, which fits so well.  The mountains are here, and everlasting.  It, is nearly winter now, but the summer will come again, when the snows are, melting, and the valleys will be green and beautiful once more; and when, those bright days are here I shall see that the peaks are waiting to be, climbed and that there are perils to be bravely met by those who love, our land; and then I shall pray.  Herr Dale, that you will come again\\n\\nMelchior stepped at once on to the ledge, and the others followed, all, three going cautiously and very slowly through the opaque mist, which, looked so solid at Saxe's feet that more than once he was ready to make, a false step, while he wondered in himself that he did not feel more, alarm, but attributed the cause rightly to the fact that he could not, see the danger yawning below.  To make the passage along this ledge the, more perilous and strange, each was invisible to the other, and their, voices in the awful solitude sounded muffled and strange.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, up there now.  I have often known men ascend mountains on what, seemed to be glorious days, and there was only a fine filmy veil to be, seen floating round the higher parts--just enough to hide them perhaps, for an hour together; but when they came down to the little hotel in the, valley, they had a long tale to tell us of having been frostbitten while, clinging to the snow slopes and ice-covered rocks, not daring to venture, up or down on account of the tremendous, tempestuous wind blowing.\\\"\\n\\nThey could see for a couple of hundred yards down the narrow way along, which the stream ran; then it bore off to the right and was hidden; and, to command a better view, as they eagerly searched the surface for some, trace of Melchior, they mounted the tumbled-together rocks, and saw that, they were at the head of a widening valley, surrounded by nearly level, mountains, forming an oval, which looked like the bed of an ancient lake, similar to the one they had lately left.  But, in place of deep water\\n\\n\\\"All right, Saxe,\\\" he said, as he rested one foot on a tiny boss; \\\"I, shall do it now.\\\"  Then, helping himself by the double rope for hold, he, climbed up the few feet between him and the projection, making use of, every little crevice or angle for his feet, till he was able to get one, arm right over the little block and hold on while he drew up the loop\\n\\nThen came a couple of hours' toilsome climb over broken stones, and up, masses that were mastered by sheer scrambling.  Now and then an easy, rock slope presented itself, or a gully between two buttresses of the, mountain, as they won their way higher and higher.  Only once was there, a really dangerous place--a mere ledge, such as they had passed along on, the previous day, but instead of a raging torrent beneath them there was, a wall of nearly perpendicular rock running down for about a thousand, feet to a great bed of snow.\\n\\nThey climbed over some awkward rocks and joined him, to find that a, dismal chasm of great depth went off here at a sharp angle; and some, little distance down one of its rugged walls he pointed out a dark, opening which seemed unapproachable at first, though a little further, examination showed that it was quite possible for a cool-headed man to, get down--one who would not think of the dark depths below.\\n\\n\\\"`Morgen!'  Well, that's `good morning.'  He must understand that; but I, don't believe he understands it as we do when one says `good morning' to, a fellow and means he's to go.  Oh!  I say, what are you following me, for?  I know.  He is a dirty-looking beggar.  He's coming for a wash., But after me, please, mein herr.  I'll have first go.  Ugh!  I'd rather, have a bath after a pig.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I don't want to hurry,\\\" muttered Saxe, as he began to glide down, the beautiful sloping curve, with the crisp large-grained snow hissing, and flying down before him.  It was glorious.  He felt as if he were, flying; then as if he were having a splendid skate without the slightest, exertion.  The bottom of the valley began to fly up to meet him, and he, had some slight consciousness of Dale being close before or behind him\\n\\nHe got himself into position as he spoke, but had to use the spike at, the end of his axe handle to form a place for his feet on either side., Then, throwing down the axe, he planted his feet firmly, bent down, nearly double, clasped his hands round the boy, and after seeing that he, had a good grip of the ashen handle above his head, called upon him to, heave.\\n\\nAnd now he found that he still held the ice-axe that had been his, companion all day.  It was stretched right out above him as far as he, could reach, and, as he moved it, to his intense joy he could see a pale, ray of light, one which increased as he moved the axe again, telling him, that, though he was buried, the head of the axe was above the level of, the snow.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly, Melchior,\\\" cried Dale.  \\\"That proves what I say.  This huge, mass of granite must have fallen from the Domberg on to the glacier, which once filled this limestone valley, and have been gradually carried, down and left here.  Such a glacier as the one which polished all these, rocks could easily have brought down that block; and when in bygone ages, the ice melted, this block was left here.  I dare say we shall find more, like it.\\\"\\n\\nIf the goat did hear, it paid no heed, but went on; and as the way, seemed to be safe in the dim blue light, Saxe followed, till from, twilight it began to grow purply-black before he had nearly overtaken, the goat, which uttered a mournful baa, and stopped short, as a, good-sized lump of ice flew by its head, and smashed upon the rock; and, as the goat still advanced, another and another came flying.\\n\\n\\\"You are quite wrong,\\\" replied Saxe, and he repeated all that Dale had, said; but the guide did not seem to be satisfied, for he shook his head, solemnly, and went about smoking his big pipe, looking despondent in the, extreme; while the others spent the morning chipping the stones in, search of minerals that might prove interesting, and of the various, Alpine plants that luxuriated in the sheltered corners and ravines, facing the south.\\n\\nSaxe said no more, for at that moment a rush of snow swept by them as if, borne upon the wings of some terrible tempest, and in the midst of the, suffocating sensation he felt himself sinking lower and lower.  The snow, was at his waist; then, as he was borne swiftly down, at his breast; and, the next instant at his lips; and all the while he was gliding downward, at railway speed.\\n\\nSaxe went off rather dissatisfied, towel in hand, to pass their, landlord's wife and receive a nod and smile.  Then he went on towards, the place which he had visited before; and now, one by one, the, cold-looking peaks began to turn rosy and brighten, the scene changing, so rapidly to orange and gold that Saxe forgot his dissatisfied, feelings, and at last stopped to look round in admiration, then in, dismay, and at last in something approaching rage; for not a dozen yards, behind him was the heavy, stolid face of Pierre, his mouth looking as if, it had not been shut since he spoke to him.\\n\\nIt took a long time to find that bubbling spring; but they discovered it, at last, coming down from hundreds of feet above their heads, over vivid, green moss and under fern fronds, to form into tiny pools in the, crevices of the rocks; and from one of these they drank with avidity, long cooling draughts of the sparkling water dipped out in the flask, cup, and then they turned to go.\\n\\nBut it was a glorious time, in spite of the disappointment, and Saxe, revelled in the wondrous scenery, growing more sure-footed and firm of, nerve day by day when in the mountains, and happy and full of fun when, back in Andregg's valley, leaving the donkey or his companion Gros, and, accompanying heavy, surly, stupid, strong Pierre up the green alps to, fetch home the goats and cows, becoming a perfect adept with a great, wooden Alpine horn, whose notes evoked wonderful echoes among the, mountains which shut them in.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!  I do wish I had paid more attention to my jolly old French and, German at school,\\\" muttered Saxe, as the man's stare quite worried him., \\\"I wonder what `be off' is?  Allez-vous en he would not understand., `Gehen!'  That's `to go.'  But you can't say `to go' to a fellow, when, you want him to be off.  And you can't say `go to,' because gehen's only, one word.  I know: `Gehen sie Jericho!'  I'll let that off at him if he, follows me any farther.\\\"\\n\\nSaxe kept his word, and he slept soundly, only waking once when the mule, uttered one of its peculiar squeals.  But no one was sufficiently, alarmed to get up, and the incident was forgotten next morning, when one, of many days of an uneventful nature commenced, during which the party, made excursions in different directions: into the ice grotto; across the, glacier to the Bergstock; up to first one and then another snowfield\\n\\nThey climbed on, but the difficulties increased, and there proved to be, an awkward ice ledge to pass along, with a terrific gulf beneath; and a, gap or two, with snow bridges, which were apparently waiting a touch to, go down at once.  These were all safely overcome.  And at last a long, slope of loose snow was all that remained to toil up before they reached, the top, where Saxe threw himself down to enjoy the wondrous prospect of, glittering ice peaks, and, a few minutes after, the food Melchior, brought from his wallet.\\n\\n\\\"Now you are laughing at me,\\\" said Saxe resentfully.  \\\"No: I am in, earnest.  Take a look round, boy, and then we'll go up the ravine and, satisfy ourselves that it is all safe, and come back after a quiet, investigation, so as to see whether there are other ways of fixing our, rope.  I should like to go up higher, too, and try whether we cannot get, out on to the mountain, as I at first proposed.\\\"\\n\\nFor a few moments Dale and Saxe knelt together there, with their hearts, throbbing wildly at their discovery.  There was a bewildering train of, thoughts, too, running through their minds, as to how the poor fellow, could have got there; and Saxe could only find bottom in one idea--that, they had been confusedly wandering about, returning another way, till, they had accidentally hit upon a further development of the great, crevasse into which the guide had fallen.\\n\\n\\\"They must have been carried farther,\\\" he tried to think; \\\"and as soon, as they can climb up they will begin to seek for me;\\\" and he repeated, this cheering thought to fight back another, which was vague, strange, and terrible--a thought which suggested the impossibility of two people, discovering the tiny hole made by the head of an ice-axe in the midst of, the snow of that tremendous avalanche.\\n\\nIt was all plain enough now.  The weight of the two who had first leaped, must have cracked a portion of the edge of the crevasse--a part rotten, from long exposure to the sun, rain and frost.  Then Melchior must have, sprung over, the great triangular piece had given way, he had made a, desperate attempt to save himself with his axe, but that had not struck, home, and he had gone down with the mass of ice and snow, the echoing, crash and boom having drowned any cry he might have uttered, even if he, had time to call for help.\\n\\n\\\"It seems strange to you English gentlemen; but you come from great, cities where people are many, and you can hardly count your friends., Out here in the deep thals, where men are shut up by the snow for weeks, together, with only their cows and mules and goats, they grow to look, upon the animals about them as friends, just as the poor animals, themselves look to their masters for their care, and run to them for, help and shelter when the great storms come down.  Why, herr, you have, seen they live in part of the house.  The chalet is built up with a warm, shelter beneath for the little flock or herd.  Poor Gros!  Andregg will, nearly break his heart; and,\\\" added the guide simply, \\\"he will not even, have the consolation of saving the skin.\\\"\\n\\nBut there was the possibility of the unfortunate man being thrown into, one of the vast pot-holes or cauldrons formed cavern-like in bends of, the chasm, where as it rushed along past the zigzag of the broken rock, the water glanced from one side, and shot almost at right angles across, to the other, to whirl round and round, ever enlarging a great well-like, hole, the centre of which looked like a funnel-like whirlpool, with the, water screwing its way apparently into the bowels of the earth, and down, whose watery throat great balls of foam were constantly being sucked.\\n\\nIt was slow work for a few minutes, till the path rose once more, and, then they progressed pretty quickly till the shelf ran down again; and, as Saxe went on through the gloom, feeling that the rope was kept fairly, taut, another sharp bend was turned, and they came in view of the facing, wall of rock, against which the stream rushed and rose up now in such a, body that Melchior raised his voice loudly:\\n\\nHe looked up to right and left at the walls of black rock growing higher, the farther they went, and now quite made up his mind that there would, be no exit from the gorge; but all the same, it had a peculiar, fascination for both, from its seeming to be a place where the foot of, man had never before trod, and the possibility of their making some, discovery deep in among the black rocks of the weird chasm.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not laughing at you, Saxe, my boy: only saying a word to cheer you, up.  You haven't got a crevasse under you, and if the worst came I, should have to catch you.  Now, let's see: here's a ledge away to your, right; but it's too far for you to leap, and there is nothing to catch, hold of.  If I got the rope up to you, you could fasten it somewhere and, slide down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say nothing, herr.  What can a man who knows the mountains say, but, that this is a place of change?  Down here in the valley it has been a, soft bright summer day, whilst up yonder in the mountains storm and snow, have raged, and the icy winds have frozen men to death.  Another day I, have left the wind howling and the rain beating and the great black, clouds hanging low; and in an hour or two I have climbed up to sunshine\\n\\nWhat followed was blind confusion, in which Saxe struggled to fight back, the snow, so that he could breathe, for the sense of suffocation was, terrible.  Then all at once the rapid gliding motion ceased, and in the, darkness he felt as if he were being held tightly in some terrible, embrace, which closed round him slowly and surely, till only his arms, were at liberty, and with these he fought.\\n\\n\\\"What can he be doing?\\\" thought Saxe sleepily.  \\\"I don't know.  It must, be packing up for our start.  Let's see, when will Melchior be back?, This morning, I suppose.  Wish he was here now to light the fire.  He's, so used to it--he does it so well; and then, he always makes such, delicious coffee, that I enjoy my breakfast far better than when we make, it ourselves, or Mr Dale makes it, and--Yes, all right!\\\"\\n\\nRight and left were the silvery veil-like cascades: down below them some, five hundred feet the little river roared and boomed, and the junction, of the silvery water of the falls with the grey milky, churned-up foam, of the torrent was plainly seen in two cases.  But the sight which, enchained Saxe's attention was the head of the valley up which they had, toiled, filled by what at the first glance seemed to be a huge cascade, descending and flowing along the ravine before him, but which soon, resolved itself into the first glacier--a wonderfully beautiful frozen, river, rugged, wild and vast, but singularly free from the fallen stones, and earth which usually rob these wonders of their beauty, and looking, now in the bright sunshine dazzling in its purity of white, shaded by, rift, crack and hollow, where the compressed snow was of the most, delicate sapphire tint.\\n\\nand, stretching out my ice-axe, I felt about till I could hook it on to, ice or stone; and as I drew myself along by the handle the water grew, less deep, then shallower still; and as I made my way it was over stones, among which water ran, and I felt about with my axe, puzzled, for it was, so strange.  There was the water running over my feet, but gently, and, the rushing river a little way behind.  What did it mean? why was it so?, Those were the questions I asked myself till the light came.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will be very useful to us, herr, and save us many a long weary, tramp,\\\" said the guide, smiling.  \\\"I am willing and strong, but I cannot, guide and carry much as well, and if you share the load with me, your, climbing will be too laborious.  With the mule to drive before us, we, can take water, food, and blankets, beside a kettle for coffee; and, sleep for one, two or three nights in the mountains, if we like.  Shall, we take him to-day?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A little, herr,\\\" said the guide, smiling--\\\"not a great deal.  It is, beyond us.  We know by the clouds and mists high above the mountains, when it is safe to go and when to stay; for if we see long-drawn and, rugged clouds hanging about the points and trailing down the cols and, over each icy grat, we know there is a tempest raging and we do not go., There is not much wisdom in that.  It is very simple, and--Look! the, young herr is fast asleep.  Poor boy!--it has been a tiring day.  Shall, we go to rest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look! look!\\\" yelled Saxe, as the mule's head shot up in the shadow, thirty or forty feet farther in, so swift was the current.  Then up came, its forelegs, and it began to paw the water like a drowning dog, just as, Melchior rose to the surface, but only in time to receive the hoofs of, the struggling mule on his chest, and he disappeared again, while the, water rolled the mule over and down out of sight.\\n\\nHe set the example, flinging himself upon his face and extending his, hands above his head, as a whizzing sound was heard; then a dull thud or, two and directly after there was a crash on the rocky side of the, couloir a few feet above their heads, followed by a shower of slaty, fragments which fell upon them, while a great fragment, which had become, detached far above, glanced off, struck the other side of the gully, and, then went downward, ploughing up the snow.\\n\\nA tense tale, such as we expect of George Manville Fenn.  A group of, English people are in the Swiss Alps.  But it is not just the beauties, of the scenery they are after, but crystals which may sometimes be, found in caves near the top of the glaciers.  They manage to find a, guide who promises to be discreet about what they do.  But someone else, is on the mountain, and he is just as interested in what they are up to\\n\\n\\\"We can get down here, herr,\\\" he said; and, setting the example, he, descended nimbly from ledge to ledge, pausing at any difficult place to, lend a hand or point out foothold, till they were half-way down, when, the ledges and crevices by which they had descended suddenly ceased, and, they stood upon a shelf from which there seemed to be no further, progression, till, as if guided by the formation, Melchior crept to the, very end, peered round an angle of the rock, and then came back.\\n\\nThey relapsed into silence again, and it was growing so dusk when they, began to climb up out of the glacier valley, that the reflection of a, fire could be seen upon the side of the rocky niche in which they had, formed their camp; and later on, as they came in sight of the little, fall at the end of the rift in the mountain, the foaming waters were lit, up so brilliantly that they looked like gold.\\n\\n\\\"Tell any curious people that we are making ascents because I am, studying the mountains.  It will be the truth; for, understand me, I am, not going alone for this search.  I want to find out more concerning the, forming of the glaciers, and the gathering of storms on the mountains., There are endless discoveries to be made, and ascents to be attempted., You will show me mountains that have not yet been climbed.\\\"\\n\\nBut this part of his suffering had its termination; and he fully grasped, that, like as in a dream, all this had occupied but a few moments of, time, for a hand was thrust round the stony angle and searched for a, projection, and as Dale eagerly grasped the humid palm, Saxe glided, round and then followed him into the corner, beneath which the water, roared and churned itself into foam, passed this in safety, and once, more they crept on, thinking now only of getting out into the daylight, and following the stream in the hope of finding poor Melchior's remains.\\n\\nHow long he stood bent forward there gazing at that horrible head Saxe, did not know, but by degrees he began to shrink back slowly, getting, farther and farther away, till he dared to turn and run with all his, might to the tent door, and creep in, fully expecting that the monster, was about to spring upon him till he was inside, when he fastened the, canvas door with trembling fingers, and crept to his bed again, where he, lay down quickly, with his breath sobbing and the perspiration standing, in great drops upon his face.  The sensation was upon him that the, terrible being he had seen would begin breaking in through the canvas, directly, and he lay there with one arm stretched out ready to wake up, Dale for help at the first sound outside the tent.\\n\\nSaxe had forgotten the incident in the conversation which ensued; and, after the discussion of the plans for the ensuing day, he went to his, sleeping-place to think about the blue-ice grotto at the bottom of the, glacier where the milky stream issued, and lie wondering how far up they, would be able to explore it, and whether it would be possible to get up, as far as the crevasse out of which they had rescued the guide.\\n\\nThen there was a long silence, during which Saxe, as if doubting that, the guide was right, carefully examined the walls of the chasm, but, always with the same result: he could see rifts and places in plenty, where he could have climbed high enough to be beyond reach of the water, even if it rose thirty or forty feet; but they were all on the other, side, which was slightly convex, while their side, as the guide had, pointed out, was concave, and would have matched exactly if the sides, had been driven together.\\n\\n\\\"After awhile, herr, after awhile.  When we get to the end of this thal, we shall come upon a larger lake.  We shall go along one shore of that, to where it empties itself.  There is much water in it, for three, glaciers run down toward it.  At the other end, beyond the schlucht, we, shall be in the greater valley, between the mountains I pointed to this, morning; and there you will find steeper places than this, wilder and, stranger, where we can camp for to-night, and to-morrow you can choose.\\\"\\n\\nand his desire was intense to begin questioning; but he restrained, himself, waiting till Melchior himself should begin, and following down, over the rugged and slippery stones for what seemed to be a weary, interminable time.  A dozen times over the boy felt as if, regardless of, the cold, and the knowledge that it was freezing sharply, he must throw, himself down and sleep.  But there was the dark figure of the patient, guide before him, struggling slowly along, and fighting against the pain, and exhaustion that nearly overcame him, and he took heart and stumbled, on till he felt as if all the trouble through which he had passed that, evening were a dream, of which this was the nightmare-like following\\n\\n\\\"I wonder what they are all doing now?\\\" he thought.  \\\"Asleep, of course., I don't believe my mother would sleep comfortably, though, if she knew, I was lying out here like this, with no bed-curtains and the snow just, over us.  It is rum, though--summer and winter all muddled up together, so closely that you stand with your right leg in July, picking flowers, and catching butterflies, and the left leg in January, so that you can, turn over and make a snowball or pick icicles off the rocks.\\\"\\n\\nHe lay down once more in the snow, shrinkingly, for in spite of his, efforts, the thought would come, \\\"Suppose a great piece of the side, should give way beneath me, and carry me down to a similar fate to, Melchior's.\\\"  These fancies made him move carefully in his efforts to, peer down farther than before, so as to force his eyes to pierce the, gloom and make out where Melchior lay.\\n\\nSaxe's sleep was almost dreamless till toward morning, when he became a, little restless consequent upon imagining that he was engaged in a, desperate encounter with a small round goblin, who was about the size of, a baby, but seemed to have the strength of an elephant.  He walked in at, the tent door, and informed Saxe that he had come to fetch the crystals, stolen from his storehouse that day; and upon Saxe refusing to give them, up, a desperate encounter took place--a fight which had no beginning and, no end, finishing off, as it were, in a mist, out of which he started to, hear the sound of wood crackling, and to find that it was day.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, to try,\\\" said Dale sadly.  \\\"Oh, but it is maddening just as, success had attended us!\\\" and he relapsed into gloomy silence, as, Melchior went about the grotto holding the lanthorn to its glittering, ceiling, the light flashing from hundreds of crystals; but every one, worth taking as a specimen had been removed, and a great rusty hammer, with which they had been broken off lay before them, forgotten in their, hurry by those who had been there.\\n\\nThey started again, and Saxe felt his heart beat heavily as the water, rose to his knees and he could feel its soft strong push against him;, but he forgot all this the next moment, on hearing Melchior give vent to, his feelings in a long, loud jodel, which sounded strange enough in the, awful rift, with an accompaniment of the noise of rushing waters, but, not half so strange as the curious whinnying half-squeal, half-neigh\\n\\nherr; but if we have to make for the lower end of the schlucht, try and, remember this: Don't struggle to get to the surface, for it is waste of, strength.  You cannot swim properly in this water, for all torrents are, full of bubbles of air, and these do not bear one up like still water., What you must do is, to get a fresh breath now and then, and let the, stream carry you along.\\\"\\n\\nThe mule hesitated.  The water was right over the track here, and the, animal bent down, sniffed and pawed at it as if uneasy; but a few more, words from Melchior made it go on a few steps very slowly, and, continually trying its way, so as to get a good foothold before going, on, and acting in a wonderfully human way by pressing itself very close, to the rock.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, herr, in the name of the canton.  But they will not be ungenerous., They will like good specimens for our museums; but they will let Herr, Dale choose and take what he wishes to his own country.  It is for, science, and we Swiss are as proud to welcome all scientific men to, explore our country as we are to serve those who merely come to admire, and return again and again, to see the mountains, glaciers and lakes of, our dear fatherland.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was quite time, poor lad,\\\" muttered Melchior.  \\\"The warmth from my, body will keep him alive, and, Heaven helping me, I may get safely down, below the snow.  If I can do that, I must find a place where I can make, a fire.  Now, lad, you call yourself a guide: make for the nearest bit, of forest, and save this poor boy's life.  But it's a hard task--a hard, task, and you need all your strength and knowledge now.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped short, colouring a little; and at that moment he turned, sharply, for there was a loud sneeze from below, and directly after a, youngish man, with a lowering look and some bits of hay sticking in his, hair, came out from the cowhouse and slouched by the front, glancing up, with half-shut eyes towards the occupants of the verandah, on his way to, a low stone-built shingle-roofed place, from which sundry bleatings told, that it was the refuge of the herd of goats.\\n\\nas he prepared in turn to descend, for in spite of the confidence given, by the rope about his chest, he found himself fancying that if the knot, came undone by the jerk he should give it if he slipped from one of, those awkward pieces of stone, he would go on falling and bounding from, rock to rock till he lay bruised and cut, perhaps killed, at the bottom, of the mountain.\\n\\nAll fell out as Melchior had foretold.  Pierre and his follower soon, returned with the tent, and humbly accepted some food before loading the, mule, and then themselves, with some of the choicest crystals, which, were deposited safely in Andregg's chalet.  The next day they made a, journey with the two animals alone, and brought back more; and again on, the following day they set off and brought the rest, Andregg gazing with, astonishment at the magnificent collection.\\n\\nHe stooped and picked up a stone as big as his fists, and suddenly, became aware of the fact that, though the mule's head was turned away, from him, the cunning animal turned its eyes back and was watching him, carefully.  For as he raised the stone Gros shook his head so that his, long ears rattled, squealed, and a peculiar quivering motion, like the, beginning of a dance, was visible in his hind quarters.\\n\\n\\\"He has got it,\\\" muttered Saxe, after a painful pause; and then they, heard the clink of the ice against the lanthorn, and saw the latter, move, while directly after, from out of the silence below, there came, the sound of a deeply drawn breath.  \\\"Can you hold on there?\\\" said Dale, then, sharply.  \\\"A little while, herr.  I am cold, but hope will put, life in me.\\\"  Dale waited a few minutes, and Saxe touched him, imploringly.  \\\"What shall we do?\\\" he whispered.  \\\"Shall I go for help?\\\"\\n\\nTo his surprise, as they descended they found Gros on his back, in a, gully full of sand and stones, snorting, flapping his ears and throwing, up his legs, as he fell over first on one side, then on the other, in, the full enjoyment of a good roll; while as they advanced it was to find, Melchior in the sheltered nook setting up the tent, after rolling some, huge pieces of rock to the four corners ready to secure the ropes; for, there was no spot in that stony ravine where a peg of iron, let alone, one of wood, could be driven in.\\n\\n\\\"It's no good to stop thinking about it,\\\" he muttered; and lowering, himself down, he began to descend steadily, with the feeling of dread, passing off directly he had started; for the excitement of the work, and, the energy that he had to bring to bear in lowering himself from ledge, to ledge, kept him too busy to think of anything but the task in hand;, so that, in what seemed to be an incredibly short space of time, he was, standing beside Dale.\\n\\nFor, as Pierre afterwards confessed, he had heard the plans made as he, stood, on their first coming, in the stable, and then and there, determined to possess himself of the valuable specimens the English, party and their guide might find.  In spite of his vacant look, he was, possessed of plenty of low cunning, and he at once secured the dog-like, services of the cretin, who had been his companion in the mountains for, years, and obeyed him with the dumb fidelity of a slave.\\n\\nThey went on for the next two hours in silence, while the pass they were, following grew more and more wild, but it opened out a little during the, next hour, but only to contract again.  And here, in a secluded place, beneath one of the vast walls of rock which shut them in, and beside a, tiny rivulet which came bubbling and foaming down, the guide suggested a, short halt and refreshment.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps not if he was very hungry,\\\" he thought, after a few minutes., \\\"But I do wish I could feel brave, like men do, and not turn shaky and, queer at the least thing.  Here was I imagining all that rubbish just, because I heard a stick broken by old Melchior to make the fire., Yesterday all I had to do was to walk along a shelf of rock, with some, water running down below me.  If it had been out in the open sunshine I, shouldn't have minded a bit; but because it was a little dark I fancied, all sorts of stuff.  Of course it was a bit startling to see a fellow go, head over heels into a torrent along with a moke and be swept away; but, I don't believe old Melk was half so much frightened as I was.\\\"\\n\\nHere the mule was unloaded by a shabby amount of pasture, ice-axes and, hammers seized, and the trio started over the level bed of the glacier, streams, the main rivulet dividing into several tiny veins, which spread, over the soft clayey earth brought down by the water.  But this soon, gave place to rock as they neared the piled-up ice, which looked to Saxe, like huge masses of dull white chalk, veined in every direction with, blue.\\n\\nSaxe glanced down as they passed the angles and gradually entered the, semi-darkness, and saw that the surface of the water was smoother, and, that, as they passed the waves formed by the water being hurled against, the opposing faces of the rock, there was less foam and turmoil; but, these places looked, if anything, more terrible than before, and the, water, as it surged up so much nearer his feet, looked to his excited, vision as if stealthily writhing towards him to lap round his legs like, some huge serpent, and snatch him down into the depths.\\n\\nSaxe nodded, and wishing fervently for the guide's strength, he toiled, on again behind him, till at last they stood upon the bare rock swept, clear of the snow, and any doubt of its being where the mishap befel, them was quite removed by their coming suddenly upon quite a wall of, snow standing many feet above their heads, and running far enough to, right and left in a jagged line, as if a flash of lightning had darted, across and made the division.\\n\\nthanking Providence that he was below all the parts which necessitated, clinging; and at last, when so utterly wearied out that his pace was a, mere crawl, he reached the pines, threaded his way in, and lowered Saxe, down.  Then, setting rapidly to work, he soon brought together a, quantity of dead wood, and started a fire with a few handfuls of pine, needles piled on the small boughs to shed its warmth upon the boy's, half-frozen feet.\\n\\nAt the moment they stepped on to the green stunted pasture, dotted with, flowers, the roar of the torrent came up from a gash in the rocks far, below, and to right and left, from at least three hundred feet up, the, waters of no less than five streams glided softly over the rocks, and, fell slowly in silvery foam, to form so many tributaries of the torrent, far below.\\n\\ntill, the sensation of thirst growing more acute, he went on, with the, towering wall of rock to right and left, and the moist odour of the, falling water saluting his nostrils, as he went close up to where one, tiny thread of water fell bubbling into a rocky basin, edged with moss--, the spot where water was obtained for regular use, its crystal purity, tempting the thirsty to drink.\\n\\n\\\"And then I took my axe again as it lay beside me, and began cutting in, a madly foolish kind of way.  There was no use in it.  I could not help, myself by cutting; but I could hear the lumps of ice hissing down, and, it made me think, so that the work did me good.  More, it did other, good, for, as I have thought over it since, it has made me try to pray, as a man should pray who has been delivered from a terrible fall.  For, those last blows of my axe must have been the ones which you heard, Herr, Saxe--the blows which brought you to my help just when my arms were, ready to sink to my side, and I had fully determined in my own mind that, I could never get down from the ledge to the little river alive.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, herr,\\\" said Melchior quietly; and thrusting the hammer handle, and the chisel through his belt, he went up and along the ledge with, wonderful agility, sprang across on to the projecting block, and then, Saxe watched him eagerly as he saw him drive in the point of the, geological hammer as high up as he could reach, and use it to hold by, while he climbed higher and got his feet on the lower edge of the, opening, where he stood with his hand inside to steady himself while he, wriggled out the hammer.  Then, holding this in his breast, they saw him, take a steel spike from his pocket, and after a little examination, thrust the point in a crevice which looked like an upward continuation, of the opening into the grotto.  This done, a sharp stroke or two from, the hammer enabled him to fix the spike sufficiently firmly to enable, him to hold on by it with his left hand while he drove it in firmly with, the hammer before passing the double rope over it, and making a sling in, which he could sit opposite the opening and work.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that!  Yes, herr.  Our people are curious.  Years ago we used to go, on quietly tending our cows and goats in the valleys, and driving them, up to the huts on the mountains when the snow melted.  There were the, great stocks and horns and spitzes towering up, covered with eternal, snow, and we gazed at them with awe.  Then you Englishmen came, and, wanted to go up and up where the foot of man never before stepped; and, even our most daring chamois hunters watched you all with wonder.\\\"\\n\\ncreeping cautiously in and out among the stones, till it reached one of, the many ledges of a precipice, and trotted along toward the edge of the, lateral valley, over which it peered cautiously, and then drew back and, went higher, repeating the action several times, and in the distance, looking more and more bearlike in its movements, only that there was, this difference, that instead of the travellers stalking the bear, the, animal seemed to be bent on stalking them.\\n\\nHe crept back to the crevasse, and listened and shouted again, to begin, wondering once more how deep the chasm would be; and at last, with the, horror of being alone there in that awful solitude creeping over him, he, felt that he must do something, and, catching up his ice-axe from where, it lay, he tramped away fifty yards to where a cluster of ragged, pinnacles of ice hung together, and with a few blows from the pick-end, of the axe he broke off a couple of fragments as big as his head, and, then bounded back.\\n\\nSaxe stood there with the shrinking sensation increasing, and it was, some time before he could rouse himself sufficiently to carry out his, first intention and throw the second piece of ice into the gulf.  As it, fell his heart beat heavily, and he once more dropped upon his hands and, knees to follow its downward course and watch the comparatively slow and, beautiful changes through which it passed before it disappeared in the, purply-black darkness, while he listened for the crash as it broke upon, the ledge preparatory to waiting in silence for the fall of the, fragments lower down.\\n\\nThen a ledge of ice had to be cautiously approached and passed, one, angle where there was barely foothold calling for all Saxe's fortitude;, but he passed it bravely and fought very hard not to show that he had, felt a slight attack of nerves.  There had been a curious catching, sensation in his throat, and his breath had come as he glanced once down, into the blue haze in an ice gulf; but he breathed more freely as firm, snow and then solid rock was reached; and the descent continued, no, allusion being made to the perilous bit, though on glancing at the guide, once he received a nod which evidently meant:\\n\\n\\\"Terribly, herr,\\\" said the guide.  \\\"And you laugh.  I don't wonder.  But, there are plenty of our simple, uneducated people in the villages who, believe all that still.  I heard it all as a child, and it took a great, deal of quiet thinking, as I grew up, before I could shake off all those, follies, and see that there was nothing to fear high up, but the ice and, wind and snow, with the dangers of the climbing.  Why, fifty years ago\\n\\nThe mountain side proving the easier, as the stones in the bottom grew, more massive and difficult to climb, the boy took to the slope, and made, such rapid progress that Dale was left behind; and he was about to shout, to Saxe not to hurry, when he saw that the boy was waiting some eighty, or ninety yards in advance, and high up above the bottom of the gorge, along which Dale had proceeded in a slower and surer way.\\n\\n\\\"Pert, but smart, Saxe,\\\" he said.  \\\"Seriously, though, a mountain, climber, who must naturally be often walking along risky places, has, enough to think about without indulging in fancies of what might be if, this happened or that took place.  Such thoughts may unnerve him; and, you may depend upon it, some of the bravest things are done by those who, think the least.  I remember, one day in London, seeing the men taking, down one of those vast scaffolds formed, not of poles, but of square, timbers bolted together; and I saw one man, about a hundred and fifty, feet from the ground, standing on one of these pieces of timber, which, was fastened to an upright at each end.  He was looking on while another, workman unscrewed one of the bolts which held it.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a heavy tug, and as some more snow rattled down into the gulf, Saxe was drawn over the edge on to the surface, where the first thing he, noticed was the fact that the other end of the rope had been fastened, round Dale's waist and passed round the ashen handle, so that when Dale, had lain down he had been able to support Saxe, and yet leave his hands, free.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; and nobody is going to fall.  You are fancying troubles.  I, know.  I have not led strangers up the mountains for twenty years, without studying their faces as well as the face of Nature.  I can read, yours.  You are scarcely yourself, and feeling fear where there is no, need.  Come now, take a long breath.  Make an effort, and be calm.  I'll, draw up the rope and fasten one end round you, and lower you down.\\\"\\n\\nanchoring it by means of its lines to stones, as soft a spot as could be, found having been selected, for they were far above the pines, and the, prospect of getting anything suitable for a bed was very small--even, moss proving scarce.  However, a rug spread beneath them saved them from, some of the asperities of the rocky ground, and after they had partaken, of their evening meal and taken a short peep round the huge hollow\\n\\nIt was not a very satisfactory place for running, encumbered as it was, with stones; but Saxe was as active as most lads of his age, and he, started off dodging in and out among huge blocks of granite, leaping, from smooth glacier ground rock to rock, making good speed over the, patches of level grass and whin, and sending the blood coursing through, his veins in the bright morning air; but to his intense annoyance he, found that his activity was nothing to that of the heavy, dirty-looking, being who kept up easily close to his heels, for every now and then the, man leaped from rock to rock as surely as a goat.  But growing a little, out of breath, and thinking at last that it was of no use to tire, himself so soon in the morning, the boy slowly settled down into a walk, just as a loud jodel came echoing from the sheltered hollow where the, chalet stood.\\n\\nHow he got out of that place he did not know; but soon after his eyes, were aching with the glare of the snow around him.  A huge eagle, a, hundred times bigger than the one he had seen, was soaring round and, round, and coming lower and lower, till it was so close to him that he, could feel the wind of its wings wafted pleasantly over his face.  The, bird's back was soft and cushiony, and it seemed to be inviting him to, take his place upon it for a ride up in the air; and he was thinking of, doing so, and gliding off over the silver-topped mountains to look out, for caves where they could chip out crystals, and perhaps discover, valuable metals; but just as he was about to throw a leg over the, feathery saddle and take his seat, there was a fearful yell, that, sounded like an accident in a trombone manufactory, where all the, instruments had been blown up by an explosion of steam.  He was hurled, back upon the snow, and held down by some monstrous creature, which, planted its feet upon his chest; and the people buried in the snow began, to moan more loudly and ring the bells.\\n\\nThe chasm had made another turn, and as Saxe spoke he climbed on a, little farther, so as to make room for his companion to join him among, the fragments of broken rock upon which he stood.  And there, right, before them, the walls seemed to run together in the side of a black, mass of rock, which formed the base of a snowy peak, one which they, recognised as having often seen, and now looking the more brilliant in, contrast with the black rock from which it rose.\\n\\nSnow was dislodged, and went gliding down the gully, and for a moment a, great patch began to slide, taking Dale with it, but a few rapid leaps, carried him beyond it; and tightening the rope as soon as he had reached, a firm place, Saxe was able to pick his way after the snow had gone by, him with a rush, but only to stop a little lower down.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no.  These people who make discoveries of curiosities in the, mountains consider they have a perfect right to them, as sons of their, fatherland; and, as foreigners, I'm afraid we should get a great deal of, law and no profit if we raised the question.  The best way is to keep, our discoveries as secret as we can.  Now, then! what do you say to, drawing the curtains and going to sleep?\\\"\\n\\nIt is that last bit of snooze which is so enjoyable.  One goes to bed, because it is time, and after a good deal of waiting sometimes one goes, to sleep; but it is not the delicious, easy-going sleep of the last, half-hour in the morning--a sleep so enticing to most people: at all, events, boys feel as if they would barter all the rest of the night for, that half-hour--the last before rising.\\n\\nHe suited the action to the word; and soon after, fully equipped for, their little journey, the pair started, descended in due time to the, glacier, where the tiny streams were trickling fast in the hot sun, and, then toiled on and on through the never-wearying scenery, past the ends, of the two great, now very familiar, crevasses, and sat down at last to, a light lunch off the entrance to the black ravine.\\n\\nHe had cause to exclaim, for from where they stood they had an opening, before them right up a side valley running off from the glacier at a, sharp angle.  This, too, was filled by a glacier, a tributary of the one, they were upon, and with the sides of the minor valley covered with snow, wherever the slope was sufficient to hold it.  Beyond rose peak after, peak, flashing pure and white--higher and higher; and even the hollows, between them filled with soft-looking pillows and cushions of dazzling, snow.\\n\\nSaxe went on, now on one side of the tiny stream, now on the other, the, sides rising right and left almost perpendicularly at times.  But there, was plenty of good foot and hand-hold, so that Saxe made his way onward, and upward at a fair rate for mountaineering, and in a very short time, they had taken a last look of the glacier; the narrow rift, turned, almost at right angles, growing blacker and more forbidding in aspect at, every step.\\n\\n\\\"There, I can tell you little more, except that it was all wild, confusion, that the roar of the water seemed to crash against my ears, till I was once more in a shallow place; and as I struggled to get my, breath, I came to what seemed to be a bar, panting heavily till I could, turn a little, and I found that the bar to which I clung was the handle, of my ice-axe lying across two masses of stone, between which the waters, roared.\\n\\n\\\"What is he doing?\\\" thought Saxe.  \\\"I hope he will soon draw me up;\\\" and, a momentary feeling of panic came over him, and the rope felt painfully, cutting.  But just then he caught sight of a dark object against the, sky.  The dark object seemed to be descending, and the next moment he, saw that it was light, and he knew that the lanthorn was being sent down, at the end of the string.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Saxe, we have hit at last upon a veritable crystal mine,\\\" said, Dale, as he held up a fresh match above his head, whose light was, reflected from the facets of hundreds upon hundreds of crystals, depending from the roof and sides, and, as far as they could see for the, tiny glow, encircling the whole place; while Saxe now found that the, projection by which he held was a hexagonal piece as clear as glass.\\n\\n\\\"Go on, then,\\\" said Dale, rather reluctantly; and they continued, climbing, with the rock towering up on one side, the ice curving over on, the other, and rising in the middle of the glacier to a series of crags, and waves and smooth patches full of cracks, in which lay blocks of, granite or limestone that had been tumbled down from the sides or far up, toward the head of the valley ages before.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder how deep it is?\\\" said Saxe aloud, after shouting till he grew, hoarse, and speaking out now for the sake of hearing a voice in that, awful silence.  \\\"I wonder how deep it is?\\\" he said again, feeling, startled at the peculiar whisper which had followed his words.  \\\"It must, go right down to the rocks which form the bottom of the valley, and of, course this ice fills it up.  It may be fifty, a hundred, or five, hundred feet.  Who can say?\\\"\\n\\nafter which there was a fresh corner to be turned, where the wave that, rose up seemed somehow illuminated; but they were quite close up, with, the water almost running over the path, before they fully grasped that, the light came from the side, bringing with it some hope, even if it, were little; and at the same time Saxe felt the possibility of going, back the same way now that the full extent of the danger could be, grasped.\\n\\nHe plodded steadily on, and Saxe noted that he kept his eyes down and, seemed to make a business of every step, measuring exactly where he, should plant it, and keeping hold, as it were, with his other foot till, he was sure that his new step was safe.  Not that this took long, but it, appeared to be all carefully studied, and the boy learned that such, caution must be the result of experience and mean safety in his arduous, climbing.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Melchior!\\\" he muttered--\\\"it must have been impossible for him to, have led the mule through here;\\\" and as he thought, this, the full light, of day came streaming in, making Dale, a few yards before him, stand out, like a silhouette clearly cut in black, while for a hundred yards the, water now ran, rapidly widening and growing less like a torrent, till, right away he could see it flowing smoothly between the towering rocks, that were piled-up on either side of its bed.\\n\\nIt was no place for conversation, even if Saxe had been so disposed; for, every one's energies were taken up by the task of mastering the way, between or over the rugged blocks which filled the bottom of the place., But at last, at a sudden turn, a gleam of the white ice was seen, and, soon after Dale was busily obliterating the mark he had made that, morning for Melchior's guidance.\\n\\n\\\"I don't care; I will not give up hoping,\\\" he said to himself, as he, moved the ice-axe gently, and saw a ray or two more light.  Then he, began to wonder whether the heat of his body would melt enough of the, snow-ice about him to enable him to work his way out; and in this hope, he waited and rested for a few minutes, for the exertion even of moving, the axe seemed to set his heart beating fast.\\n\\nand after a few steps into what Saxe called a blue gloom, they stood, gazing into the azure depths of the cavern, which grew darker till they, were purple and then utterly black.  Then they listened to the gurgle, and babble of the tiny river, as it came rushing and dashing over the, rock in many an eddy and swirl, while from far away up in the darkness, there were mysterious whisperings and musical echoes that were strange, to hear.\\n\\n\\\"It's very silly lying here,\\\" he said to himself again, as the scent of, the burning pine-wood increased.  \\\"Bit cold outside the rug; but we left, the door and the windows open last night, and that's healthy all the, same.  I do wish, though, I could get on without being scared so soon., Perhaps it's all through being ill last year and feeling so weak.  But I, didn't seem weak yesterday.  I was precious tired, but so was Mr Dale., I'm afraid I'm a coward, and I suppose all I can do is to hide it and, not let people see.\\\"\\n\\nand had been brought up breathlessly with a sudden jerk, was swinging, slowly to and fro, clinging with both hands to the rope, and trying, vainly to get a rest for his feet on the smooth wall of ice, over which, his toes glided whenever he could catch it; but this was not often, for, the ice receded, and in consequence he hung so clear, that the line, turned with him, and he was at times with his back to the side from, which the rope was strained, gazing at the dimly-seen opposite wall\\n\\nIt was easier said than done, for the path was so narrow that Melchior, had to press the mule close to the perpendicular rock, and hold on by, the pack-saddle and then by the animal's neck, to get by.  Once he did, slip, his foot gliding over the edge; but by throwing himself forward he, saved himself, clung to the path for a few minutes as he hung over it\\n\\n\\\"Right!\\\" replied Dale; and a minute later he caught the rings of hemp, thrown to him, and rapidly knotted the middle round Saxe, the end to his, own waist; and as he knotted, _click, click! chip, chip_! went the, ice-axe, deftly wielded by the guide, who with two or three blows broke, through enough of the crust to make a secure footing while the ice flew, splintering down the slope in miniature avalanches, with a peculiar, metallic tinkling sound.\\n\\nwhich entailed a severe fight with self, for a sensation of hunger soon, developed itself.  But he won by a vigorous effort, and, after all was, ready, forced himself away from the fire and the kettle, walking right, out of the niche, to stand watching the glorious changes on the mountain, peaks, and the lines of light slowly creeping, downward and driving out, the shadows where it was still night while high up amongst the, glittering ice fields it was glorious day.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr, I will manage it all,\\\" said Melchior quietly.  \\\"I can soon, fetch the basket, and it will be better.  The young herr will want all, his activity to get along without a load.  I have been here four times, before.  I should have been five times; but one May the snow had melted, after a great rain, and the lake was so full that the waters were feet, above the pathway, and they rushed through, so that the great walls of, rock shook as if they would fall in.  There,\\\" he said, removing the, mule's load and carrying it two or three yards back, to place it against, the natural wall.  \\\"It will be quite safe there,\\\" he continued, with a, smile; \\\"nobody will come.  Ah, Gros, my friend, is that cool and, restful?\\\"\\n\\nThere was no time to think or reason in such a position.  He could see, the head, and feel the pressure of the feet; and he knew that he was not, dreaming now.  Frightened he was naturally, but he acted at once as a, lad of manly character might be expected to act: he struck out with his, doubled fist, giving the object a heavy blow just beneath the horns.\\n\\n\\\"Wait till he gets his breath, Melchior,\\\" said Dale.  \\\"There, boy, it, has been a splendid lesson for you, in a place where the worst that, could have happened to you was a sharp glissade and some skin off your, hands and face.  That ice-axe ought to have been driven like lightning, into the snow, or the pick held towards it downward.  It would have, ploughed in and anchored you.\\\"\\n\\nmuscular-looking man, whose swarthy face was sheltered by a wide-brimmed, soft felt hat, very much turned up at the sides, and in whose broad band, was stuck a tuft of the pale grey, starry-looking, downy plant known as, the Edelweiss.  His jacket was of dark, exceedingly threadbare velvet;, breeches of the same; and he wore gaiters and heavily nailed lace-up, boots; his whole aspect having evoked the remarks, when he presented, himself at the door of the chalet:\\n\\nIt was a picturesque sight, and wonderfully attractive to a hungry, boy,--the steaming kettle, the glowing fire lighting up the whole niche;, and, to make the sight more enjoyable, there was the savoury smell, one, which seemed to have had a peculiar effect upon Gros, the mule, for he, had left the patch where he was picking up a good succulent meal, to, draw near and stand blinking his eyes, flapping his long ears, and, staring, till Saxe drove him off as he came to take his place.\\n\\n\\\"Step by step I cut my way.  It was slow, tiring work; but every notch, made was a step nearer to liberty, and I worked on.  As I climbed higher, I had to cut my notches deeper, for the slope was not quite so easy, and, the slightest slip would have sent me to the bottom; and from the height, to which I had at last climbed this might have meant a broken arm or, leg, for there was no water to fall into but a few inches trickling, among the stones.\\n\\nHe held up his hand as a rushing noise was heard somewhere high up among, the dense mists.  This rapidly increased to a terrific roar, followed by, a deep booming crash; and so tremendous was the sound, that the noise of, the falling waters seemed for the moment to be hushed.  Then the, thunderous crash rolled right away among the mountains, dying in faint, echoes, and the rush of the waterfalls filled the air once more.\\n\\ntorn out of their birthplaces by tempests, or swept away by downfalls of, snow or rock; then they panted up some zigzag, faintly marked, where it, was impossible to follow the bed of the stream; and as they climbed, higher fresh visions of grandeur opened out before them, though the path, was so rugged that much of the view was lost in the attention that had, to be given to where they placed their feet.  But from time to time a, halt was called, a geological hammer produced, and a piece of the rock\\n\\nThere was no reply beyond what sounded like a groan; and the pair at the, edge of the crevasse began to tighten the rope gently as they drew up, their axes, with the weight gradually increasing; they saw by the light, of the lanthorn that they first dragged the poor fellow up into a, sitting position; and not having the full burden to deal with yet, Dale, got a shorter hold of the axe handle, Saxe doing the same.\\n\\nThat seemed as if it would not be long first, as far as the boy was, concerned.  He had apparently forgotten the numbness of his limbs and, the peril through which he had passed, and in spite of the roughness of, the ice and snow he continued to get over it in his extemporised, sandals, which had the advantage of not slipping.  But the day's toil, had been excessive before the accident; and though his spirits had kept, him up so far, the time was fast approaching when exhaustion would, conquer.\\n\\nBut there was no crash--no hissing, spattering of small fragments, dropping into water--nothing but the terrible silence, which seemed as, if it would never end; and at last a heavy dull splash, the hissing of, water, and a curious lapping sound repeated by the smooth water, till, all died away, and there was silence once again.  \\\"Awful!\\\" muttered, Saxe, as he wiped his damp brow.  \\\"Poor Melchior!--no wonder he didn't, answer to my cries.\\\"\\n\\nwhen seen from above on the bluff, had looked fairly smooth--just, in, fact, one great winding mass of ice flowing down in a curve to the foot., He was not prepared for the chaos of worn, tumbled and crushed-up, masses, among which the guide led the way.  Some parts that were, smoother were worn and channelled by the running water, which rushed in, all directions, mostly off the roughly curved centre to the sides, where, it made its way to the river beneath.\\n\\n\\\"In the dark?  How did you know where to hit?\\\" cried Saxe.  \\\"I could cut, steps in the ice blindfold, herr,\\\" said Melchior sharply.  \\\"When the, hands and arms have grown used to doing a thing, they can do it even if, the eyes are not watching them.  Of course I do not say I always struck, exactly in the right place, but I could get sufficiently near to make a, notch in the smooth ice; and I kept on, with my heart growing lighter as, I chipped away, listening to the echoing of the blows and the hissing, sound of the bits of ice as they slipped down the smooth face--for it, was perfectly smooth, and as if polished.\\n\\n\\\"I must have taken a dozen steps before my ice-axe checked against the, ice, and I threw myself against it, trying to calm my burning head by, resting it against what I took to be the arch of the large ice-cave into, which I had found my way; but, instead of the wall leaning over toward, me, as it would in a rugged arch, it sloped away.  I did not notice this, much as I leaned forward, for the ice felt delightfully cool against my, burning head; and as the coldness went in farther and farther, I seemed, to be able to think better and clearer, and this set me trying about, with the axe, till I found that I was at the bottom of a great ice, slope, as it seemed to me; and as I raised my head and gazed upward my, heart gave a great throb, for there, high up, far away, was a gleam of, light, and at the sight of that strength came to me, and I grasped my, axe tightly, for that meant escape from that terrible place, and life.\\n\\nThen came a warning cry from Melchior, who threw down his end of the, rope, and directly after began to descend with an ease that robbed his, task of all aspect of danger.  Every movement was so quietly and easily, made, there was such an elasticity of muscle and absence of strain, that, before the man was half down, both Dale and Saxe were wondering how they, could have thought so much of the task, and on Melchior joining them\\n\\nDale scanned the position anxiously, seeing now for the first time that, the rough angles and ridge-like pieces of rock along which the boy had, made his way ceased about five feet from where he stood, and that he, must have jumped on to a narrow piece of stone not a foot long and, somewhere about a third of that width; and though, in the vast chasm in, which they both were, the height above him, where Saxe was, spread-eagled, as it were, against the perpendicular rock, looked, perfectly insignificant, he was close upon a hundred feet up, and a fall, would have been very serious, if not fatal.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, herrs,\\\" he said; \\\"but we all try to do our best.  What was I, saying?  I remember: that I was falling down and down, and set my teeth, and held my axe with both hands to try and strike if I should reach a, slope, so as to stop myself; but there was nothing but the black walls, of ice on either side and the roar of waters below.  I thought of this, as I prepared myself for being broken on the cruel rocks beneath: a, great deal to think, herrs, in so short a time, but thoughts come, quickly when one is falling.  Then I was plunged suddenly into deep\\n\\nTwo hours' climb more than walk, with the sun coming down with scorching, power; but in spite of the labour, no weariness assailing the, travellers, for the air seemed to give new life and strength at every, breath they drew.  But now, in place of the view being more grand, as, they climbed higher the valley grew narrow, the scarped rocks on either, side towered aloft and shut out the snowy peaks, and at last their path, led them amongst a dense forest of pines, through whose summits the wind, sighed and the roaring torrent's sound was diminished to a murmur.\\n\\n\\\"Over those and many others beyond them,\\\" replied Dale; and then, as, they followed each other in single file, Melchior leading and the mule, close at his heels like a dog, weariness and the heat of the narrow, sun-bathed gorge put an end to conversation, till Saxe noticed that the, waters foaming along far down in the bottom were running in the same, direction as they were going, whereas earlier in the day they met them.\\n\\nIn this case it began to repeat the adventures of the day before, but in, a curiously bizarre manner; and in consequence Saxe found himself being, disappointed in the heights of the mountains, which were exceedingly, small--mere anthills covered with snow, up which he began to climb so as, to stand on their tops; but as he climbed they began to grow, so that, there was always a piece more to get up, and so he went on, finding that, there was no getting right to the top.  Then avalanches began to fall, rumbling and roaring down, and covering people at the bottom--hundreds, of them, so it seemed to him; and he could hear them moaning under the, snow, which by some curious chance of circumstances was just below him., But the odd thing was that they did not seem to mind it much, only, moaning piteously and impatiently, as if they were in a hurry for a thaw, to come and set them free.  Then one of them began to ring the bell for, dinner; and another did the same; and Saxe felt that he ought to be, doing something to take them food to eat--coarse bread, butter, cheese, like Gruyere, full of holes, and a jug of milk, but he did not do it\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; I am the guide,\\\" said Melchior quietly; and he began the, descent pretty rapidly, but stopped at the foot of each more difficult, part to look up and wait for the others.  Sometimes he drove the sharp, end of his ice-axe into the earth or some crevice, and held it there to, act as a step for the others to descend; and at other times he pressed, himself against the rock and offered his shoulders as resting-places for, their feet, constantly on the watch to lessen the difficulties and guard, against dangers in a place where a slip of a few feet might have, resulted in the unfortunate person who fell rolling lower with, increasing impetus, and the slip developing into a terrible accident.\\n\\nHere he was more at home, and able to think out how he could best pass, round that ledge and creep by this angle before he reached it.  Saxe did, not speak, but hung upon his back perfectly inert--a terrible load at, such a time; but the guide made no mental complaint,--simply toiled on, slowly enough for a couple of hours; then, thinking of a certain nook in, the mountain just below the snow-line where there was a good-sized clump, of dwarfed and distorted pines, he decided to stop there for the night\\n\\nSaxe raised his arms, which had felt nerveless the moment before, took a, fresh hold, and began to climb desperately.  The first movements were, horrible, and he felt the creeping sensation of horror once more, and, stopped, clinging hard, thinking that he could do no more; but the rope, was against his face, and as it vibrated he knew that even if he slipped, it would hold him, and the cold, dank sensation passed away again as he, got a good foothold and was helped by the strain on the rope; and just, while he was saying to himself, \\\"I shall never do it--I shall never do, it!\\\" a great hand seized the rope round his chest, and he was drawn, right on to a rocky platform, where Melchior was seated with his legs, widely apart, and his heels against two projecting corners.\\n\\n\\\"Hold my axe, sir,\\\" he said; and on Saxe taking it, the man picked up, the block he had chipped off, walked a little way from them, and, after, looking about a little, signed to them to watch, as he hurled the lump, from him, after raising it above his head.  As he threw it, he ran back, toward them, and the piece fell with a crash between two spires which, projected from the icy barrier.\\n\\nTo the surprise of all, the mule was perfectly satisfied so long as it, could keep its head and ears in the warmth and shelter, and never once, attempted to creep in nearer; and so another hour passed, only broken by, the low murmur of Dale's voice as he talked to the guide, and the plash, and rush of water.  For the dripping was drowned now by the enormous, amount which fell, and this went on increasing till there was quite a, heavy roar, as of many falls.\\n\\nin spite of Melchior's efforts to keep the way clear, the snow rose, about Saxe's face, so that very little more of it would have meant, suffocation.  The boy fought hard with his left hand to keep the snow, clear, but there was no space sufficient for him to sweep it right away;, and the moments grew more and more anxious as Melchior's axe cut and, chipped, and he tore out great pieces from the hole he was making and, hurled them down the slope.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" he said, \\\"let me bear out against the rope;\\\" and, raising the, ice-axe in both hands, he began to use it vigorously, cutting hard at, the frozen snow, till there was a sharp crack, and he threw himself back, while a huge piece of the cornice broke away and dropped down out of, sight.  Then all waited breathlessly till a faint hissing sound told, that it had touched rock or ground somewhere below, but how far down, Saxe did not realise, till Melchior made way for him to creep to the, extreme edge and look.\\n\\nSaxe seemed to have awakened from sleep with a terrible throbbing, headache, to listen to a curious digging sound which was going on over, his head.  He could hear a loud rumbling too, and, as he was still, wandering and confused at being suddenly awakened, as it appeared to, him, the truth came with a leap, just as the axe handle, which he still, held, was sharply agitated to keep the hole open, and Melchior's voice, came down to him.\\n\\n\\\"I have tried hard to win the herr's confidence, and to deserve it,\\\", said the man coldly.  \\\"I secured that rope as I believe any guide upon, the mountains would have fastened it.  The rope gave way not by breaking, or coming untied, and I cannot tell how.  I told the herr the beliefs of, my people, and that I had ceased to think that they were true; but we, are seeking to penetrate the mysteries of the mines, and this accident, has befallen us.  I can say no more.\\\"\\n\\nThese he whittled into shavings, and these shavings served to start the, green pine boughs which had formed their beds; and once a pretty good, glow was obtained, with plenty of embers, the wetness of the branches, brought under cover mattered very little, especially as the guide ranged, them close to the fire to dry, ready against they were required; and had, contrived that the blinding smoke should sweep right out at once, a few, broad branched boughs stuck in the ground or propped upright helping to, establish a draught.\\n\\ntill my arms began to grow heavy as lead.  But still I worked on, every, step cut bringing me nearer to the surface, though at the end of each, hour's hard labour I seemed very little advanced; and at last, as I grew, more weary, my spirits began to sink again, for the slope grew more and, more steep, though I would not own to it myself.  Still it was steeper, and steeper, and I cut desperately, and made deep notches into which I, forced my feet, while I cut again till the last part was nearly, perpendicular; and after cutting my last step I felt that my task was, done, for I had reached a ledge over which I was able to climb, till I, could lie half upon it, knowing that I had come to where the wall went, straight up, and that it would be impossible to hold on to that slippery, ice and cut my way higher.\\n\\n\\\"I'm beginning to understand now,\\\" said Saxe.  \\\"An ice slope is not a, very serious thing to a guide who has worked upon the mountains ever, since he was a boy, herrs.  Feeling satisfied now that I had but to cut, my way up step by step, I grew more easy in my mind, glanced up, and, then, after a little feeling about in the darkness, I chipped my first, step, just enough for my toe to hold in, rose up and cut another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, herr: so suddenly that I had not time to use my axe, and before I, could utter a cry I was falling fast down into the dark depths.  I, believe I did cry out for help, but the noise of ice and snow falling, and breaking on a ledge some way down drowned my voice; and as I turned, over in the air, I felt that I had made my last climb, and that the end, had come, as I had known it come to better guides.\\\"\\n\\nA slight rustling sound beneath the verandah had just taken Saxe's, attention, and he was wondering whether any one was in the low stone, cowhouse over which the chalet was built--from the economical ideas of, the people, who make one roof do for both places, and give to their, cattle an especially warm winter house--when the guide's words roused, him from his drowsy state, and he started up to gaze at the rather rare, phenomenon before him.\\n\\nThey turned back together for about a hundred yards over the smooth, snow, following their own steps clearly marked in the white surface; and, then stopped short aghast, for the deeply indented place in the snow, where they had landed in their jump was gone, and in its stead they saw, a great triangular-shaped opening widening the crevasse to more than, double its original dimensions, while just at its edge close to their, feet there was a peculiar mark, such as would have been made by an, ice-axe suddenly struck down through the snow to plough its way till it, disappeared over the edge.\\n\\n\\\"You know the rest, gentlemen.  You came and saved my life just when I, had not sufficient strength left to have tied the rope safely about my, waist.  It was the noose which saved me, and I could not believe in that, safety till you dragged me over the side of the crevasse.  Herr Dale--, Herr Saxe, how am I to say words to show you how thankful I am?\\\"\\n\\nEven in that little time the difference in the level of the water was, very evident; and as Saxe waded along, with the stream rushing by him, and seeming to give him quite a series of pushes, he could not help an, excited feeling of dread filling his breast, and he wondered whether he, should get out of the place alive if some sudden rush of water came down, in a wave and swept them off the ledge.\\n\\nUp this cleft they mounted steadily, till, to Saxe's surprise, he found, himself high above the mighty wall which shut in the valley, and only, now, as it were, at the foot of the mountains, which rose up fold beyond, fold, apparently endless, and for the most part snow-capped, with snow, lying deeply in the hollows, and filling up the narrow col or depression, between the peaks where they were to pass.\\n\\n\\\"It's horrible,\\\" said Saxe, in a subdued tone; and he turned and looked, down again where the guide had broken away the cornice, which curved out, over a tremendous precipice, and saw that had he followed his, inclination and slid down the snow slope, he would have gone over the, cornice, and then plunged headlong, to fall nearly sheer down what, seemed to be three or four thousand feet, to where a glacier wound along, past the foot of the precipice.\\n\\nand after a quick glance at the thick snow which arched over the, crevasse, he drew back; and Melchior led on again, striking the shaft of, his ice-axe handle down through the crust before him at every step, and, divining, by long practice and the colour of the snow, the direction of, the crevasse so well, that he only once diverged from the edge, sufficiently for the handle to go right down.\\n\\nMelchior seized the bridle and checked him, just as they were ascending, the first of a series of zigzags leading out of the deep valley, with, the result that the donkey brayed again and had to be held by main force, by Pierre's arm round his neck, for he had dragged his head out of the, bridle; while Gros began to kick and back and behave so obstreperously, that Dale gave him a sharp prod with the end of his alpenstock.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; and it was so cold that it deadened a man's strength.  But I, knew I must fight for my life, for I said to myself I had my two English, herrs above there on the gletscher, and how could they find their way, back from the wilderness of ice?  Then I thought of how the little river, must run, and I could tell--for I knew it must be very much like the, places where I have looked up from the end of gletschers (glaciers you, call them)--that there would be deep holes worn in the rock where great, stones are always whirling round and grinding the hollows deeper.  These, would be hard to pass; but I hoped by clinging to the side to get by, them without being drowned.  They were not what I feared.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vorwarts,\\\" said the guide quietly; and they obeyed, following his lead, till they reached the spot where the clear waters of the fall glided, into the dingy stream, and then followed the latter up and up for quite, half an hour before Saxe stopped short, and took off his straw hat to, wipe his steaming forehead, as he gazed up at the end of the glacier; he, was now so low down that the surface was invisible, and facing him there, was a curve rising up and up, looking like a blunted set of natural, steps.\\n\\n\\\"There: that is safe,\\\" said Dale.  \\\"Now pick up your ice-axe and hold by, the rope with your left hand, so as to ease the strain upon your chest., Use the ice-axe cautiously, to keep yourself from turning round and from, striking against the side.  When you get down to the ledge, which must, be, from what you say, only just out of sight, you will chip a secure, place for your feet if the ice slopes, and, proceeding quite slowly and, calmly, make yourself first quite safe.  When this is done, unfasten the, rope from about you, and make it fast about poor Melchior.  Be very, particular about the knot, mind.  Don't forget what I have taught you., That knot must not slip in any way, either in tightening round his chest, or coming undone.\\\"\\n\\nHe suspended the English-made stout glass lanthorn to the little, ridge-pole; and then, resuming his jacket, he threw the coil of rope, over his shoulder, took his ice-axe, Dale and Saxe taking theirs, all, new and bright, almost as they had left the manufacturer's, and started, at once for the shelf from which the grand view of the snow-clad, mountains had met their gaze.  After proceeding along this a short, distance, Melchior stopped, climbed out upon a projecting point, and, examined the side of the precipice.\\n\\nAs Saxe stepped cautiously along, feeling his way by the wall and, beating the edge of the precipice with the handle of his ice-axe, he, felt over again the sensations he had had in passing along there that, morning.  But the dread was not so keen--only lest there should be a, sudden strain on the rope caused by one of them slipping; and he judged, rightly that, had one of them gone over the precipice here, nothing, could have saved the others, for there was no good hold that they could, seize, to bear up against the sudden jerk.\\n\\nHe wanted no explanation, for they were standing at the edge of a, precipice, gazing down at another huge glacier, which glittered in the, rays of the morning sun--a vast chaos of ice whose cracks and shadows, were of a vivid blue; and as they gazed up towards the point where it, suddenly curved round an immense buttress, there beyond, peak after, peak, as far as eye could reach, stood out in the clear air, and all, seeming to rise out of the fields and beds of snow which clung around, them and filled every ravine and chasm running up from their feet.\\n\\nThree or four awkward bits were circumvented; a couloir or gully full of, snow mounted; and then there was a long climb up a moderate slope toward, where a ridge of rocks stood out sharply, with snow sloping down on, either side, the ridge running up far into the mountain; but before they, could get to this a deep bed of old snow--\\\"firn\\\" Melchior called it--a, great sheet, like some large white field, had to be passed.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the stones are always falling from the bare sides of the gorge;, they drop on to the glacier, and in course of time are washed by the, melting ice into the crevasses and down to the bare rock beneath the, glacier.  There they glide down, with its weight upon them, right over, the rock, and the surface is worn off from the fallen stone and the bed, rock in a thin paste, which is washed away by the glacier.  Then, as it, descends, it of course discolours the water.\\\"\\n\\nDale had not been idle.  His first proceeding had been to throw a couple, of rugs over their companion, who in due time sat up to drink the hot, coffee with avidity.  He could only eat a few morsels of bread, but he, partook of the coffee again, and then sank back to drop into a heavy, sleep, and Saxe and Dale sat watching him for some time, forgetting, their own mental and bodily weariness in their anxiety respecting the, poor fellow's state.  But after bending over him several times, and, always with the same satisfactory discovery that the sufferer was, sleeping easily and well, both Dale and Saxe yielded to their own desire, to lie down, carrying on a conversation one minute and the next to be, sleeping as heavily as the guide.\\n\\nIt was as if that clump of pines would never be reached, and there were, moments when he was ready to think that he must have missed them; but a, glance to left or right at the rocks towering up into the sky sufficed, to convince him that he was still on the right track, for he knew them, by heart, and, giving his load a fresh shift, he toiled on again, hot\\n\\n\\\"Still, I would not give up, herrs; but reached up and cut till I felt, that I was gliding off the narrow ledge, and then I had to rest, and use, my axe to cut notches for my feet to hold and others for my hands, for, the least slip would have sent me down like a stone in a couloir, and I, wanted rest before I had to get down again.  I asked myself if I could;, and a cold feeling came over me, as I thought that all this work had, been for nothing, and that the end had now really come.\\n\\n\\\"As soon as I understood this I stopped, for I knew that the opening to, these rivers would grow smaller and smaller, and that it would be of no, use to go up there if I wanted to escape.  So, wading along, I tried to, reach the wall, to lean against it and rest before going back to the, torrent, knowing as I did that this must be the only way.\\n\\nSaxe nodded, took hold of the rope, turned round, reached up as high as, he could, and then was about to throw his whole weight upon it, when it, gave way, and came down upon him.  This, with the surprise, threw him, off his balance, and he would have gone down backward, headlong to the, bottom of the narrow cleft, but for the action of the guide, who darted, out one hand and caught him.\\n\\nFaintly as it was seen, it was plain enough to those who watched with, throbbing pulses.  The lanthorn had been beyond Melchior's reach, and as, he lay there on a kind of shelf or fault in the ice, he had tried to, hook the string toward him with his ice-axe, slipped, and would have, gone headlong down lower, but for the mountaineer's instinctive effort, to save himself by striking his axe-pick into the ice.\\n\\n\\\"No one can imagine how wonderful the mountains are,\\\" said the guide, solemnly.  \\\"I looked up at them as a little child, and I have been up, amongst them from a boy, while I am now thirty-five; and yet they are, always changing and ever new.  Sometimes they are all light and, sunshine, though full of hidden dangers.  Sometimes they are wild and, black and angry, when the wind shrieks and the lightning flashes about, their shattered heads, and the thunders roar.  Yes, young herr, you, never thought it was half so wonderful as this.  Shall we go on?\\\"\\n\\nIn spite of the delay it was still early; and, feeling no trace of his, last night's weariness, Saxe tramped on along the zigzag shelf in the, valley side, till the edge of the steep part was reached.  Melchior, strode off to the right, and then to the left, so as to reach the narrow, valley down which the stream came that had supplied them with water for, their morning's bath.\\n\\n\\\"Make any fellow sleep,\\\" he said to himself, as he raised his head; and, he was in the act of passing his hand across his wet lips, when he, became suddenly petrified, and stood there motionless, gazing straight, before him at a hideous object, apparently not a yard away.  It looked, misty and dim in the semi-darkness, but plain enough for the boy to see, apparently a huge head resting in a pair of hands, which held the chin, and pressed up the long loose cheeks on either side, curving up the, monstrous mouth into a ghastly grin.  The forehead was low, and the, eyebrows were shaggy, while from beneath them glared into his a great, pair of glowing eyes, that flashed at times and sparkled in the, starlight, which rained down on and through a bush of dark, tangled, hair, a portion of which hung below the head on either side, and stood, out wildly around.\",\n          \"The girl had stiffened a little at our approach, as I could see, but a, young girl's stiffness is always rather amusing than otherwise, and I, did not mind it. Neither, that I could see, did Mr. Glendenning, and it, soon passed. It seemed that she had left her mother lying down in her, state-room, where she justly imagined that if she did not see the rapids, she should suffer less alarm from them; the young lady had come frankly, to the side of Mrs. March as soon as she saw her, and asked if she might, sit with her. She now talked to me for a decent space of time, and then, presently, without my knowing how, she was talking to Mr. Glendenning\\n\\nIn their attempts to talk he was aware that she was seconding all his, endeavors with intelligence, and with a humorous subtlety to which he, could not pretend. She was suffering from their anomalous position as, much as he, but she had the means of enjoying it while he had not. After, half an hour of these defeats Mrs. Simpson operated a diversion by, coming in with two glasses of lemonade on a tray and some slices of, sponge-cake. She offered this refreshment first to Langbourne and then, to her niece, and they both obediently took a glass, and put a slice of, cake in the saucer which supported the glass. She said to each in turn\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir,\\\" said the old man when he rose to go at last, \\\"I guess, you've settled it for me. You've made me see that there can be an, immortal life that's worth living; and I was afraid there wa'n't! I, shouldn't care, now, if I woke up any morning in the other world. I, guess it would be all right; and that there would be new conditions, every way, so that a man could go on and be himself, without feelin', that he was in any danger of bein' wasted. You've made me want to meet, my boy again; and I used to dread it; I didn't think I was fit for it. I, don't know whether you expect me to thank you; I presume you don't; but, I\\\"--he faltered, and his voice shook in sympathy with the old hand that, he put trembling into Ewbert's--\\\"I _bless_ you!\\\"\\n\\nEvidently, Mrs. Bentley was very much worse than she had been; her, breathing was painfully labored. But if her daughter had any anxiety, about her condition, she concealed it most effectually from us. I, decided that she had perhaps been asking the doctor as to certain, symptoms that had alarmed her, and it was in the rebound from her, anxiety that her spirits had risen to the height I saw. Glendenning, seized the moment of her absence after luncheon, when she helped her, mother up to her room, to impart to me that this was his conclusion too., He said that he had not seen her so cheerful for a long time, and when I, praised her in every way he basked in my appreciation of her as if it, had all been flattery for himself. She came back directly, and then I, had a chance to see what she might have been under happier stars. She, could not, at any moment, help showing herself an intellectual and, cultivated woman, but her opportunities to show herself a woman of rare, social gifts had been scanted by circumstances and perhaps by, conscience. It seemed to me that even in devoting herself to her mother, as she had always done she need not have enslaved herself, and that it, was in this excess her inherited puritanism came out. She might, sometimes openly rebel against her mother's domination, as my wife and I, had now and again seen her do; but inwardly she was almost passionately, submissive. Here I thought that Glendenning, if he had been a different, sort of man, might have been useful to her; he might have encouraged her, in a little wholesome selfishness, and enabled her to withhold sacrifice, where it was needless. But I am not sure; perhaps he would have made her, more unhappy, if he had attempted this; perhaps he was the only sort of, man whom, in her sense of his own utter unselfishness, she could have, given her heart to in perfect peace. She now talked brilliantly and, joyously to me, but all the time her eye sought his for his approval and, sympathy; he, for his part, was content to listen in a sort of beatific, pride in her which he did not, in his simple-hearted fondness, make any, effort to mask.\\n\\n\\\"My dear fellow,\\\" I said, \\\"I see your point. But don't you think you are, quite needlessly adding to your affliction by pressing it? You two are, in the position which isn't at all uncommon with engaged people, of, having to wait upon exterior circumstances before you get married., Suppose you were prevented by poverty, as often happens? It would be a, hardship as it is now; but in that case would your engagement be any, less an error than it is now? I don't think it would, and I don't, believe you think so either.\\\"\\n\\nso vital at first, had perished in its formulation, and in the, repetition he was sensible, or he was fearful, of an insincerity, a, hollowness in the arguments he had originally employed so earnestly, against the old man's doubt. He recognized with dismay a quality of, question in his own mind, and he fancied that as Hilbrook waxed in, belief he himself waned. The conviction of a life hereafter was not, something which he was _sharing_ with Hilbrook; he was _giving_ it, absolutely, and with such entire unreserve that he was impoverishing his, own soul of its most precious possession.\\n\\nHe hardly knew how to dissemble the feeling of humiliation mixed with, indignation which flashed up in him, and which, he was afterwards, afraid, must have made him seem rather curt in his response to the head, waiter's civilities. Miss Axewright left the dining-room first, and he, hurried out to look her up as soon as he had despatched the coffee and, steak which formed his breakfast, with a wholly unreasoned impulse to, offer her some sort of reparation for the slight the conditions put upon, her. He found her sitting on the veranda beside the friendly tabby of, his last night's acquaintance, and far, apparently, from feeling the, need of reparation through him. She was very nice, though, and after, chatting a little while she rose, and excused herself to the tabby, with, a politeness that included Gaites, upon the ground of a promise to Miss, Desmond that she would come up, the first thing after breakfast, and see, how the piano was getting along.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I must allow that, if we are to suppose that young ladies have, anything to do with young men getting engaged to them; it doesn't seem, exactly delicate. But the novel phase of this great matter is the, position of the young lady's mother in regard to it. From what I could, make out she consents to the engagement of her daughter, but she don't, and won't consent to her marriage.\\\" My wife glared at me with so little, speculation in her eyes that I felt obliged to disclaim all, responsibility for the fact I had reported. \\\"Thou canst not say _I_ did, it. _They_ did it, and Miss Bentley, if any one, is to blame. It seems\\n\\nIf it was ridiculous, and if with her sense of the ridiculous she felt, it so, she was unable to take it lightly, or to make him take it, lightly. At some faint gleams which passed over her face he felt himself, invited to regard it less seriously; but he did not try, even, provisionally, and they fell into a silence that neither seemed to have, the power of breaking.\\n\\nThe girls' voices followed him down the walk,--Juliet's treble, and, Barbara's contralto,--and he believed that they were making talk, purposely against a pressure of silence, and did not know what they were, saying. It occurred to him that they had not asked how long he was, staying, or invited him to come again: he had not thought to ask if he, might; and in the intolerable inconclusiveness of this ending he, faltered at the gate till the lights in the windows of the parlor, disappeared, as if carried into the hall, and then they twinkled into, darkness. From an upper entry window, which reddened with a momentary, flush and was then darkened, a burst of mingled laughter came. The girls, must have thought him beyond hearing, and he fancied the laugh a burst, of hysterical feeling in them both.\\n\\nEwbert felt all the more impelled to his own first visit by the fame of, these failures, but he was not hastened in it. He thought best to wait, for some sign or leading from Hilbrook; but when none came, except the, apparent attention with which Hilbrook listened to his preaching, and, the sympathy which he believed he detected at times in the old eyes, blinking upon him through his sermons, he felt urged to the visit which, he had vainly delayed.\\n\\nbut they made us no formal invitation to come again, and we never did., That day, however, I caught a glimpse of Tedham's little girl, as she, flitted through the hall, after we were seated in the parlor; she was in, black, a forlorn little shadow in the shadow; and I recalled now, as we, stood once more on the threshold of the rather dreary house, a certain, gentleness of bearing in the child, which I found infinitely pathetic\\n\\never since he had arrived from the station at Birkwall's door, where, Mrs. Birkwall met them and welcomed him. He had been sufficiently, impressed with the aristocratic quiet of the vast square white old, wooden house, standing behind a high white board fence, in two acres of, gardened ground; but the fine hallway with its broad low stairway, the, stately drawing-room with its carving, the library with its panelling, and portraits, and the dining-room with its tall wainscoting, united to, give him a sense of the pride of life in old Burymouth such as the raw, splendors of the millionaire houses in New York had never imparted to, him.\\n\\nThen he told her, and he had trouble to keep her resentment in bounds., She held that, as a minister, he ought to have rebuked the wretched, creature; that it was nothing short of offensive to him for Hilbrook to, take such a position. She said his face was all flushed, and that she, knew he would not sleep, and she should get him a glass of warm milk;, the fire was out in the stove, but she could heat it over the lamp in a, tin cup.\\n\\nand glad of the southwestern breeze which he caught at this point over, the shoulder of the hill. He had expected to go round to the side door, of the house, where he had parted with Hilbrook on his former visit; but, he stopped on seeing the old man at his front door, where he was looking, vaguely at a mass of Spanish willow fallen dishevelled beside it, as if, he had some thought of lifting its tangled spray. The sun shone on his, bare head, and struck silvery gleams from his close-cropped white hair;, there was something uncommon in his air, though his dress was plain and, old-fashioned; and Ewbert wished that his wife were there to share his, impression of distinction in Hilbrook's presence.\\n\\nalways in her high, gay tinkle, that it was very pleasant there in the, summer time. He did not know what he answered. He was aware that from, time to time Miss Simpson said something in a frightened undertone. He, did not know how long it was before Mrs. Simpson made an errand out of, the room, in the abeyance which age practises before youthful society in, the country; he did not know how much longer it was before Miss Bingham, herself jumped actively up, and said, Now she would run over to Jenny's\\n\\nand better, with a good strong nurse, who could lift her this way and, that, and change her about, without feeling her heart-strings wrung at, every gasp, as that poor child must. Oh, I _wish_ Glendenning was man, enough to make her run off with him, and get married, in spite of, everything. But, of course, that's impossible--for a clergyman! And her, sacrifice began so long ago that it's become part of her life, and, she'll simply have to keep on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" the approachable tabby answered, \\\"it's the one at the piano. The, violinist is Miss Axewright, of South Newton. They were at the, Conservatory together in Boston, and they are such friends! Miss Desmond, would never have played here--intends to take pupils in Portland in the, winter--if Miss Axewright hadn't come,\\\" and the pleasant old tabby, purred on, with a velvety pat here, and a delicate scratch there. But, Gaites heard with one ear only; the other was more devotedly given to, the orchestra, which also claimed both his eyes. While he learned, as, with the mind of some one else, that the Desmonds had been very much, opposed to Phyllis's playing at the Inn, but had consented partly with, their poverty, because they needed everything they could rake and scrape, together, and partly with their will, because Miss Axewright was such a, nice girl, he was painfully adjusting his consciousness to the fact that, the girl at the piano was not the girl whom he had seen at Boston and, whom he had so rashly and romantically decided to be Miss Phyllis, Desmond. The pianist was indeed Miss Desmond, but to no purpose, if the, violinist was some one else; it availed as little that the violinist was, the illusion that had lured him to Lower Merritt in pursuit of Miss, Desmond's piano, if she were really Miss Axewright of South Newton.\\n\\neven if it could have had mercy, as an individual may, mercy was felt to, be bad morals, and the case was unrelentingly pushed. His sentence was, of those sentences which an eminent jurist once characterized as rather, dramatic; it was pronounced not so much in relation to his particular, offence, as with the purpose of striking terror into all offenders like, him, who were becoming altogether too common. He was made to suffer for, many other peculators, who had been, or were about to be, and was given, the full penalty. I was in court when it was pronounced with great, solemnity by the judge, who read him a lecture in doing so; I could have, read the judge another, for I could not help feeling that it was, more, than all the sentences I had ever heard pronounced, wholly out of, keeping with the offence. I met Hasketh coming out of the court-room\\n\\nThroughout the day, under his wife's watchful eye, he failed of the naps, he tried for, and he had to own himself as haggard, when night came, again, as the fondest anxiety of a wife could pronounce a husband. He, could not think of his talk with old Hilbrook without an anguish of, brain exhaustion; and yet he could not help thinking of it. He realized, what the misery of mere weakness must be, and the horror of not having, the power to rest. He wished to go to bed before the hour when Hilbrook, commonly appeared, but this was so early that Ewbert knew he should, merely toss about and grow more and more wakeful from his premature, effort to sleep. He trembled at every step outside, and at the sound of, feet approaching the door on the short brick walk from the gate, he and, his wife arrested themselves with their teacups poised in the air., Ewbert was aware of feebly hoping the feet might go away again; but the, bell rang, and then he could not meet his wife's eye.\\n\\nWe were somewhat surprised then to find her seated by the rail with the, younger lady of the two whom she meant to avoid if she meant anything by, what she said. She was laughing and talking on quite easy terms with her, apparently, and \\\"There!\\\" she triumphed as we came up, \\\"I've kept your, camp-stools for you,\\\" and she showed them at her side, where she was, holding her hand on them. \\\"You had better put them here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In that case we should not be opposing our wills to the will of some, one else, who has a better claim to her daughter's allegiance than I, have. It seems to me that our error was in letting her mother consent to, our engagement if she would not or could not consent to our marriage., When it came to that we ought both to have had the strength to say that, then there should be no engagement. It was my place to do that. I could, have prevented the error which I can't undo.\\\"\\n\\nIt was still raining heavily, and on the first cut beyond Porchester, Junction his train was stopped by a flagman, sent back from a, freight-train. There was a wash-out just ahead, and the way would be, blocked for several hours yet, if not longer. The express backed down to, Porchester, and there seemed no choice for Gaites, if he insisted upon, going to Craybrooks, but to take the first train up the old Boston and, Montreal line to Wells River and across by the Wing Road through, Fabyans; and this was what he did, arriving very late, but quite in time, for all he had to do at Craybrooks.\\n\\nThe street was straight, and while he was yet a good way off he saw the, gate open before the house, and a girl whom he recognized as Miss, Bingham close it behind her. She then came down under the maples towards, him, at first swiftly, and then more and more slowly, until finally she, faltered to a stop. He quickened his own pace and came up to her with a, \\\"Good-morning\\\" called to her and a lift of his hat. She returned neither, salutation, and said, \\\"I was coming to see you, Mr. Langbourne.\\\" Her, voice was still a silver bell, but it was not gay, and her face was, severely unsmiling.\\n\\neven if it should turn up then and there and personally appeal to him, for help. In this humor he was not prepared to have anything of the kind, happen, and he stood aghast, in looking absently into a freight-car, standing on the track, to read, \\\"Miss Phyllis Desmond, Lower Merritt, N., H.,\\\" on the slope of the now familiar case just within the open doorway., It was as if the poor girl were personally there pleading for his help, with the eyes whose tenderness he remembered.\\n\\n\\\"Well, if I ever!\\\" said Juliet Bingham, following her with astonished, eyes. Then she turned to Langbourne. \\\"It's perfectly ridiculous, and I, don't see how I can ever explain it. I don't think Barbara has shown a, great deal of tact,\\\" and Juliet Bingham was evidently prepared to make, up the defect by a diplomacy which she enjoyed. \\\"I don't know where to, begin exactly; but you must certainly excuse my--manner, when I came, in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, let it do for me!\\\" I confess that I was astonished at this, turn, or should have been, if I could be astonished at any turn a woman, takes. \\\"I will see her for you, if you wish, and I will tell her just, how it is with you, and then she can decide for herself. You have, certainly no right to decide for her, whether she will see you or not\\n\\nas it showed between the white mansions across the way. One of these, as, I have already mentioned, was the Conwell place; and after we had talked, of the landscape awhile, Glendenning said: \\\"By the way! Why don't you, buy the Conwell place? You liked it so much, and you were all so well in, Gormanville. The Conwells want to sell it, and it would be just the, thing for you, five or six months of the year.\\\"\\n\\ntill one summer, while we were still disputing where we should spend the, hot weather within business reach, there came a letter from him saying, that he was settled at Gormanville, and wishing that he might tempt us, up some afternoon before we were off to the mountains or seaside. This, revived all my wife's waning interest in him, and it was hard to keep, the answer I made him from expressing in a series of crucial inquiries, the excitement she felt at his being in New England and so near Boston\\n\\n\\\"Four o'clock,\\\" said the man. \\\"This freight goes out first;\\\" and now, Gaites noticed that up on a siding beyond the station an engine with a, train of freight-cars was fretfully fizzing. The engineer put a, silk-capped head out of the cab window and looked back at the, station-master, who began to work his arms like a semaphore telegraph., Then the locomotive tooted, the bell rang, and the freight-train ran, forward on the switch to the main track, and commenced backing down to, where they stood. Evidently it was going to pick up the car with Phyllis, Desmond's piano in it.\\n\\nand then stood staying herself against the piano-case, with a final, lamentation of \\\"Oh, it's a shame! I'll never speak to any of you again!, How perfectly mean! _Oh!_\\\" The last exclamation signalized the start of, the horses at a brisk mountain trot, which the driver presently sobered, to a walk. The three remaining girls followed, mocking and cheering, and, after them lounged the three remaining men, at a respectful distance\\n\\n\\\"Oh, did you, did you?\\\" He began to cry, and as we hurried along over, the fields, he sobbed with the wrenching, rending sobs of a man. \\\"I, _knew_ you did, and I believe it was God himself that put it into your, heart to write me that letter and take off that much of the blame from, me. I said to myself that if I ever lived through it, I would try to, tell you how much you had done for me. I don't blame you for refusing to, do what I've asked you now. I can see how you may think it isn't best\\n\\nThe lovers promised themselves, as we knew, that Mrs. Bentley would, relent, and abandon what was more like a whimsical caprice than a, settled wish. But as time wore on, and she gave no sign of changing, I, have wondered whether some change did not come upon them, which affected, them towards each other without affecting their constancy. I fancied, their youthful passion taking on the sad color of patience, and, contenting itself more and more with such friendly companionship as, their fate afforded; it became, without marriage, that affectionate, comradery which wedded love passes into with the lapse of as many years, as they had been plighted. \\\"What,\\\" I once suggested to my wife, in a, very darkling mood--\\\"what if they should gradually grow apart, and end, in rejoicing that they had never been allowed to join their lives?, Wouldn't that be rather Hawthornesque?\\\"\\n\\nGaites, you'll be the tea-table talk for a week; you'll be married to, that girl before you know it. What is the use of flying in the face of, Providence? Come! There's time enough to get a ticket, and have your, check changed from Kent Harbor to Lower Merritt, and the Hill Country, express will be along here at nine o'clock. You can't let that poor, thing start off on her travels alone again!\\\"\\n\\nwhich inculcated with the peculiar grace of his gentle, poetic nature a, refinement of the mystical theology of the founder. The Rev. Adoniram, Rixon, who had seventy years before formulated his conception of the, religious life as a patient waiting upon the divine will, with a, constant reference of this world's mysteries and problems to the world, to come, had doubtless meant a more strenuous abeyance than Clarence, Ewbert was now preaching to a third generation of his followers. He had, doubtless meant them to be eager and alert in this patience, but the, version of his gospel which his latest apostle gave taught a species of, acquiescence which was foreign to the thoughts of the founder. He put as, great stress as could be asked upon the importance of a realizing faith, in the life to come, and an implicit trust in it for the solution of the, problems and perplexities of this life; but so far from wishing his, hearers to be constantly taking stock, as it were, of their spiritual, condition, and interrogating Providence as to its will concerning them\\n\\nbut we had misgivings of the village mansion; and I am afraid that I, rather unduly despatched the personal part of my letter, in my haste to, ask what Glendenning knew and what he thought of the Conwell place., However, the letter seemed to serve all purposes. There came a reply, from Glendenning, most cordial, even affectionate, saying that the, Conwell place was delightful, and I must come at once and see it. He, professed that he would be glad to have Mrs. March come too, and he, declared that if his joy at having us did not fill his modest rectory to, bursting, he was sure it could stand the physical strain of our, presence, though he confessed that his guest-chamber was tiny.\\n\\n\\\"I know I oughtn't to have come. I know I oughtn't to have written to, you in the beginning, but you had let me write, and I thought you would, let me come. I tried always to be sincere with you; to make you feel, that you could trust me. I believe that I am an honest man; I thought I, was a better man for having known you through your letters. I couldn't, tell you how much they had been to me. You seemed to think, because I, lived in a large place, that I had a great many friends; but I have very, few; I might say I hadn't any--such as I thought I had when I was, writing to you. Most of the men I know belong to some sort of clubs; but, I don't. I went to New York when I was feeling alone in the world,--it, was from something that had happened to me partly through my own, fault,--and I've never got over being alone there. I've never gone into, society; I don't know what society is, and I suppose that's why I am, acting differently from a society man now. The only change I ever had, from business was reading at night: I've got a pretty good library., After I began to get your letters, I went out more--to the theatre, and, lectures, and concerts, and all sorts of things--so that I could have, something interesting to write about; I thought you'd get tired of, always hearing about me. And your letters filled up my life, so that I, didn't seem alone any more. I read them all hundreds of times; I should, have said that I knew them by heart, if they had not been as fresh at, last as they were at first. I seemed to hear you talking in them.\\\" He, stopped as if withholding himself from what he had nearly said without, intending, and resumed: \\\"It's some comfort to know that you didn't want, them back because you doubted me, or my good faith.\\\"\\n\\nHilbrook's apathy was gone, and his gentleness; he had suddenly an air, and tone of fierce challenge. As he spoke he brought a clenched fist, down on the arm of his chair; he pushed his face forward and fixed, Ewbert with the vitreous glitter of his old eyes. Ewbert found him, terrible, and he had a confused sense of responsibility for him, as if, he had spiritually constituted him, in the charnel of unbelief, out of, the spoil of death, like some new and fearfuler figment of, Frankenstein's. But if he had fortuitously reached him, through the one, insincerity of his being, and bidden him live again forever, he must not, forsake him or deny him.\\n\\nThis measurably consoled my wife, but she did not cease to denounce the, idea for some moments. When she ended, I asked her if she would allow, the company to employ Tedham in a subordinate place in another city, and, when she signified that this might be suffered, I said that this was, what would probably be done. Then I added, seriously, that I thoroughly, liked the notion of it, and that I took it for a testimony that poor old, Tedham was right, and that he had at last fully expiated his offence, against society.\\n\\nHe had arrived at this extreme before he received the note from Mrs., Birkwall, which she made his prompt bread-and-butter letter the excuse, of writing him. She wrote mainly to remind him of his promise to stay, another day with her husband on his way home through Burymouth; and she, alleged an additional claim upon him because of what she said she had, made Birkwall do for him. She had made him go down to the freight-depot, every day, and see what had become of Phyllis Desmond's piano; and she, had not dared write before, because it had been most unaccountably, delayed there for the three days that had now passed. Only that morning\\n\\nFriendship between girls is never equal; they may equally love each, other, but one must worship and one must suffer worship. Langbourne read, the differing temperaments necessary to this relation in the differing, voices. That which bore mastery was a low, thick murmur, coming from, deep in the throat, and flowing out in a steady stream of indescribable, coaxing and drolling. The owner of that voice had imagination and humor, which could charm with absolute control her companion's lighter nature\\n\\nI recalled, now, looking at him there in the twilight of the woods, how, happy they had both seemed that sunny afternoon in the city square, as, they flashed away from my door and glanced back at me and smiled, together. I went into the house and said to my wife with a formulation, of the case which pleased me, \\\"If there is anything in the world that, Tedham likes better than to ride after a good horse, it is to ride after, a good horse with that little girl of his.\\\" \\\"Yes,\\\" said my wife, \\\"but a, good horse means a good deal of money; even when a little girl goes with, it.\\\" \\\"That is so,\\\" I assented, \\\"but Tedham has made a lot lately in real, estate, they say, and I don't know what better he could do with his, money; or, I don't believe _he_ does.\\\" We said no more, but we both, felt, with the ardor of young parents, that it was a great virtue, a, saving virtue, in Tedham to love his little girl so much; I was, afterward not always sure that it was. Still, when Tedham appealed to me, now in the name of his love for her, he moved my heart, if not my, reason, in his favor; those old superstitions persist.\\n\\nfor my own sake, if not for his, but I had nothing in mind but that I, had better keep there, and so I waited for him to speak. I believed he, was beating about the bush in his own thoughts, to find some indirect or, sinuous way of getting at what he wanted to know, and that it was only, because he failed that he asked bluntly, \\\"March, do you know where my, daughter is?\\\"\\n\\nShe resumed: \\\"But when your picture came, I said it had _got_ to stop;, and so we just sent back my picture,--or I don't know but what Barbara, did it without asking me,--and we did suppose that would be the last of, it; when you wrote back you were coming here, we didn't believe you, really would unless we said so. That's all there is about it; and if, there is anybody to blame, I am the one. Barbara would never have done, it in the world if I hadn't put her up to it.\\\"\\n\\nHe woke next morning in a wide, low, square chamber to the singing of, robins in the garden, from which at breakfast he had luscious, strawberries, and heaped bowls of June roses. When he started for his, train, he parted with Mrs. Birkwall as old friends as he was with her, husband; and he completed her conquest by running back to her from the, gate, and asking, with a great air of secrecy, but loud enough for, Birkwall to hear, whether she thought she could find him another girl in, Burymouth, with just such a house and garden, and exactly like herself, in every way.\\n\\nand that made me all the more anxious to know just how much of the, trouble she had taken in. I suppose it was all a kind of awful mystery, to her, as most of our trials are to children; but when her father was, taken from her, she seemed to think it was something she mustn't ask, about; there are a good many things in the world that children feel that, way about--how they come into it, for one thing, and how they go out of, it; and by and by she didn't speak of it. She had some of his lightness\\n\\nThe cordial interest of the university people was hardly a compensation, for the disappointment he shared with Hilbrook; but his wife was so, happy in it that he could not say anything to damp her joy. \\\"Now,\\\" she, declared, on their way home, \\\"I am perfectly satisfied that they will, keep coming. You never preached so well, Clarence, and if they have any, appreciation at all, they simply won't be able to keep away. I wish you, could have heard all the nice things they said about you. I guess, they've waked up to you, at last, and I do believe that the idea of, losing you has had a great deal to do with it. And _that_ is something, we owe to old Ransom Hilbrook more than to anything else. I saw the poor, old fellow hanging about, and I couldn't help feeling for him. I knew he, wanted to speak with you, and I'm not afraid that he will be a burden, again. It will be such an inspiration, the prospect of having the, university people come every Sunday, now, that you can afford to give a, little of it to him, and I want you to go and see him soon; he evidently, isn't coming till you do.\\\"\\n\\nand, so far as he could make out, had been born engaged to her; and he, showed an intuition in the gingerly handling of her rather uncertain, temper which augured well for his future happiness. His future happiness, seemed to be otherwise taken care of, for though he was a young man of, no particular prospects, and no profession whatever, he had a generous, willingness to liberate his affianced to an artistic career; or, at, least, there was no talk of her giving up her scheme of teaching the, piano-forte because she was engaged to be married, he was exactly fitted, to become the husband of a wage-earning wife, and was so far from being, offensive in this quality that everybody (including Miss Desmond, rather, fitfully) liked him; and he was universally known as Charley Ellett.\\n\\nIn those words the implication that Miss Bingham had operated the whole, affair finally unfolded itself. But distasteful as the fact was to, Langbourne, and wounding as was the realization that he had been led on, by this witness of his infatuation for the sake of the entertainment, which his letters gave two girls in the dull winter of a mountain, village, there was still greater pain, with an additional embarrassment\\n\\nHe was undoubtedly getting older, and he looked it. He was one of those, gentle natures which put on fat, not from self-indulgence, but from want, of resisting force, and the clerical waistcoat that buttoned black to, his throat swayed decidedly beyond a straight line at his waist. His, red-gold hair was getting thin, and though he wore it cut close all, round, it showed thinner on the crown than on the temples, and his pale, eyebrows were waning. He had a settled patience of look which would have, been a sadness, if there had not been mixed with it an air of resolute, cheerfulness. I am not sure that this kept it from being sad, either.\\n\\nwhich would perpetually provoke and satisfy. Her companionship would be, as easy and reasonable as a man's, while it had the charm of a woman's., At the moment it seemed to him that life without this companionship, would be something poorer and thinner than he had yet known, and that he, could not endure to forego it. Somehow he must manage to see the girl, and make her acquaintance. He did not know how it could be contrived\\n\\nWhen the train pulled out of the station into the clearer light, she, turned her face from him toward the forward window, and the corner of, her mouth, which her half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of, piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an, upward curve, and a gay light came into the corner of her eye; then the, mouth drooped again, and the light went out.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm quite willing to be cheerful about it, my dear,\\\" I returned;, \\\"and, if you like, we will fancy Mrs. Bentley coming round and ardently, wishing their marriage, and their gayly protesting that after having, given the matter a great deal of thought they had decided it would be, better not to marry, but to live on separately for their own sake, just, as they have been doing for hers so long. Wouldn't that be cheerful?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nice fo-aks,\\\" said the conductor, providing himself for conversational, purposes with a splinter from the floor. He put it between his teeth and, continued: \\\"I took ca' thei' hosses, one while, as long's they _had_, any, before I went on the ro-ad. Old gentleman kep' up a show till he, died; then the fam'ly found out that they hadn't much of anything but, the place left. Girls had to do something, and one of 'em got a place in, a school out West--smaht, _all_ of 'em; the second one kind o' runs the, fahm; and the youngest, here, 's been fittin' for a music-teacha. Why\\n\\nI could not go away, and I walked down the path to the gate, and waited, there, in case I should be in any wise wanted. After a very long time, the doctor came bolting over the walk towards me, as if he did not see, me, but he brought himself up short with an \\\"Oh!\\\" before he actually, struck against me. I had known him during our summer at the Conwell, place, where we used to have him in for our little ailments, and I would, never have believed that his round, optimistic face could look so, worried. I read the worst in it; Glendenning was right; but I asked the, doctor, quite as if I did not know, whether there was anything serious, the matter.\\n\\nIt was some time after the Ewberts had given up expecting him that old, Hilbrook came to return the minister's visit. Then, as if some excuse, were necessary, he brought a dozen eggs in a paper bag, which he said he, hoped Mrs. Ewbert could use, because his hens were giving him more than, he knew what to do with. He came to the back door with them; but Mrs., Ewbert always let her maid of all work go out Sunday evening, and she, could receive him in the kitchen herself. She felt obliged to make him, the more welcome on account of his humility, and she showed him into the, library with perhaps exaggerated hospitality.\\n\\n\\\"You didn't go to the Book for the point you made _against_ me. But if, you go to it now for the point I want you to make _for_ me, what are you, going to find? Are you going to find the promise of a life any different, from the life we have here? I accept it all,--all that the Old Testament, says, and all that the New Testament says; and what does it amount to on, this point?\\\"\\n\\nI have no wish, and if I had the wish I should not have the art, to keep, back the fact that these young people were evidently very much taken, with each other. They showed their mutual pleasure so plainly that even, I could see it. As for Mrs. March, she was as proud of it as if she had, invented them and set them going in their advance toward each other\\n\\nWe made what speed we could after them, but they were long out of sight, in the mile that it seemed to me we were an hour in covering before we, reached the Bentley place. The doctor's buggy stood at the gate, and I, perceived that I was without authority to enter the house, on which some, unknown calamity had fallen, no matter with what good-will I had come; I, could see that Glendenning had suffered a sudden estrangement, also\\n\\nHamilton Gaites sat breakfasting by the window of a restaurant looking, out on Park Square, in Boston, at a table which he had chosen after, rejecting one on the Boylston Street side of the place because it was, too noisy, and another in the little open space, among evergreens in, tubs, between the front and rear, because it was too chilly. The wind, was east, but at his Park Square window it tempered the summer morning, air without being a draught; and he poured out his coffee with a content, in his circumstance and provision which he was apt to feel when he had, taken all the possible pains, even though the result was not perfect., But now, he had real French bread, as good as he could have got in New, York, and the coffee was clear and bright. A growth of crisp green, watercress embowered a juicy steak, and in its shade, as it were, lay, two long slices of bacon, not stupidly broiled to a crisp, but, delicately pink, and exemplarily lean. Gaites had already had a, cantaloupe, whose spicy fragrance lingered in the air and mingled with, the robuster odors of the coffee, the steak, and the bacon.\\n\\nIt should not be difficult to overcome it; but Ewbert had not yet, succeeded in arraying his reasons satisfactorily against it when his, wife returned from her work in the kitchen, and sat down beside the, library table. Her coming operated a total diversion, in which Hilbrook, lapsed into his apathy, and was not to be roused from it by the, overtures to conversation which she made. He presently got to his feet, and said he mast be going, against all her protests that it was very, early. Ewbert wished to walk home with him; but Hilbrook would not, suffer this, and the minister had to come back from following him to the, gate, and watching his figure lose itself in the dark, with a pang in, his heart for the solitude which awaited the old man under his own roof., He ran swiftly over their argument in his mind, and questioned himself, whether he had used him with unfailing tenderness, whether he had let, him think that he regarded him as at all reprobate and culpable. He gave, up the quest as he rejoined his wife with a long, unconscious sigh that, made her lift her head.\\n\\nI did not say anything, for my heart was in my throat, and we stumbled, along in silence till we climbed the last wall, and stood on the, sidewalk that skirted the suburban highway. There, under the, street-lamp, we stopped a moment, and it was he who now offered me his, hand for parting. I took it, and we said, together, \\\"Well, good-by,\\\" and, moved in different directions. I knew very well that I should turn back\\n\\nBut Miss Alber was already engaged for canoeing, and Gaites was obliged, to drive off with his hostess alone. She said she did pity him, but she, pitied him no longer than it took to get at the express agent. Then she, began to pity herself, and much more energetically if not more, sincerely, for it seemed that the agent had not been able to learn, anything about her trunk, and was unwilling even to prophesy concerning, it. Gaites left him to question at her hands, which struck him as, combining all the searching effects of a Roentgen-ray examination and the, earlier procedure with the rack; and he wandered off, in a habit which, he seemed to have formed, toward the freight-house.\\n\\nEwbert had forgotten the points he had made before, and he had to take, up the whole subject anew, he did so at first in an involuntarily, patronizing confidence that Hilbrook was ignorant of the ground; but, from time to time the old man let drop a hint of knowledge that, surprised the minister. Before they had done, it appeared that Hilbrook, was acquainted with the literature of the doctrine of immortality from, Plato to Swedenborg, and even to Mr. John Fiske. How well he was, acquainted with it Ewbert could not quite make out; but he had, recurrently a misgiving, as if he were in the presence of a doubter, whose doubt was hopeless through his knowledge. In this bleak air it, seemed to him that he at last detected the one thing in which the old, man felt an interest: his sole tie with the earth was the belief that, when he left it he should cease to be. This affected Ewbert as most, interesting, and he set himself, with all his heart and soul, to, dislodge Hilbrook from his deplorable conviction. He would not perhaps, have found it easy to overcome at once that repugnance which Hilbrook's, doubt provoked in him, if it had been less gently, less simply owned. As, it was, it was not possible to deal with it in any spirit of mere, authority. He must meet it and overcome it in terms of affectionate, persuasion.\\n\\n\\\"She suffers terribly from asthma. I don't suppose she has lain down in, bed for ten years. She sleeps in an easy-chair, and she's never quite, free from her trouble; when there's a paroxysm of the disease, her, anguish is frightful. I've never seen it, of course, but I have heard, it; you hear it all through the house. Edith has the constant care of, her. Her mother has to be perpetually moved and shifted in her chair\\n\\nwithout seeing her; she rose at once and went out to him. Ewbert heard, her asking him into the library, and then he heard them in parley there;, and presently they came out into the hall again, and went to the front, door together. Ewbert's heart misgave him of something summary on her, part, and he did not know what to make of the cheerful parting between, them. \\\"Well, I bid you good-evening, ma'am,\\\" he heard old Hilbrook say, briskly, and his wife return sweetly, \\\"Good-night, Mr. Hilbrook. You, must come soon again.\\\"\\n\\nEwbert could not deny this, though he did not feel himself so much to, blame for it as she would have liked to make out in her pity of him. He, owned that if he had never gone to see Hilbrook the old man would, probably never have come near them, and that if he had not tried so much, to interest him when he did come Hilbrook would not have stayed so long;, and even in this contrite mind he would not allow that he ought not to, have visited him and ought not to have welcomed him.\\n\\n\\\"He seems to be an Episcopal clergyman,\\\" she said, in a haughty summing, up. \\\"From his name I should have supposed he was Scotch and a, Presbyterian.\\\" She began to patronize the trip we were making, and to, abuse it; she said that she did not see what could have induced them to, undertake it; but one had to get back from Niagara somehow, and they had, been told at the hotel there that the boats were very comfortable. She, had never been more uncomfortable in her life; as for the rapids, they, made her ill, and they were obviously so dangerous that she should not, even look at them again. Then, from having done all the talking and most, of the eating, she fell quite silent, and gave her daughter a chance to, speak to my wife. She had hitherto spoken only to her mother, but now, she asked Mrs. March if she had ever been down the St. Lawrence before.\\n\\nand look the ground over, and see how much we have been suffering for, them unnecessarily.\\\" The fact was that we had now scarcely spoken of, Glendenning or the Bentleys for six months, and our minds were far too, full of our own affairs to be given more than very superficially to, theirs at any time. \\\"We could both go as well as not,\\\" I suggested, \\\"and, you could call upon the Bentleys while I looked after the company's, business.\\\"\\n\\nIt was so long since he had known a Northern spring that he had, forgotten how much later the beginning of May was in New Hampshire; but, as his train ran up from Springfield he realized the difference of the, season from that which he had left in New York. The meadows were green, only in the damp hollows; most of the trees were as bare as in, midwinter; the willows in the swamplands hung out their catkins, and the, white birches showed faint signs of returning life. In the woods were, long drifts of snow, though he knew that in the brown leaves along their, edges the pale pink flowers of the trailing arbutus were hiding their, wet faces. A vernal mildness overhung the landscape. A blue haze filled, the distances and veiled the hills; from the farm door-yards the smell, of burning leaf-heaps and garden-stalks came through the window which he, lifted to let in the dull, warm air. The sun shone down from a pale sky\\n\\nGaites saw in Ellett's impudent, amusing face that he divined, Millicent's continued ignorance of his romance, and was bent on, mischief. But the girl paid no heed to his talk, and Gaites could not, help laughing. He liked the fellow; he even liked Miss Desmond, who was, so much softened by the occasion that she had all the thorny allure of a, ripened barberry in his fancy. They both hung about the seat, where he, stood ready to take his place beside Millicent, till the conductor, shouted, \\\"All aboard!\\\" Then they ran out, and waved to the lovers, through the window till the car started.\\n\\nA stir of garments made itself heard from the parlor at last, and we, knew the ladies had risen. In a loud voice Hasketh began to say that, they had a carriage down at the gate, and I said they had better let me, show them the way down; and as my wife followed the others into the, hall, I pulled open the outer door for them. On the threshold stood a, man about to ring, who let his hand drop from the bell-pull. \\\"Why\\n\\nI have often had to criticise life for a certain caprice with which she, treats the elements of drama, and mars the finest conditions of tragedy, with a touch of farce. No one who witnessed the marriage of Arthur, Glendenning and Edith Bentley had any belief that she would survive it, twenty-four hours; they themselves were wholly without hope in the, moment which for happier lovers is all hope. To me it was like a, funeral, but then most weddings are rather ghastly to look upon; and the, stroke that life had in reserve perhaps finally restored the lost, balance of gayety in this. At any rate, Mrs. Glendenning did live, and, she is living yet, and in rather more happiness than comes to most, people under brighter auspices. After long contention among many, doctors, the original opinion that her heart trouble was functional, not, organic, has been elected final, and upon these terms she bids fair to, live as long as any of us.\\n\\nGaites flushed in a joyful confusion, and put the joke by as well as he, could. But he was beginning to feel it not altogether a joke; it had, acquired an element of mystery, of fatality, which flattered while it, awed him; and he could not be easy till he had asked one of the, freight-handlers what had happened to the car. He got an answer--flung, over the man's shoulder--which seemed willing enough, but was wholly, unintelligible in the clang and clatter of a passenger-train which came, pulling in from the southward.\\n\\nHe amused himself thinking what he should do if he found Phyllis, Desmond's piano there, but he was wholly unprepared to do anything when, he actually found it standing on the platform, as if it had just been, put out of the freight-car which was still on the siding at the door. He, passed instantly from the mood of gay conjecture in which he was playing, with the improbable notion of its presence to a violent indignation.\\n\\n\\\"I guess we're built like an onion,\\\" he said, with a severity that, forbade Ewbert to feel anything undignified in the homely illustration., \\\"You can strip away layer after layer till you seem to get to nothing at, all; but when you've got to that nothing you've got to the very thing, that had the life in it, and that would have grown again if you had put, it in the ground.\\\"\\n\\nHe confided equally in my wife and myself, but there were times when I, think he rather preferred the counsel of a man friend. Once when we had, gone a walk into the country, which around Gormanville is of the, pathetic Mid-Massachusetts loveliness and poverty, we sat down in a, hillside orchard to rest, and he began abruptly to talk of his affair., Sometimes, he said, he felt that it was all an error, and he could not, rid himself of the fear that an error persisted in was a wrong, and, therefore a species of sin.\\n\\nRansom Hilbrook came and went among the villagers in the same sort of, inaccessible contiguity. He did not shun passing the time of day with, people he met; he was in and out at the grocer's, the meat man's, the, baker's, upon the ordinary domestic occasions; but he never darkened any, other doors, except on his visits to the bank where he cashed the checks, for his quarterly allowance. There had been a proposition to use him, representatively in the ceremonies celebrating the acceptance of the, various gifts of Josiah Hilbrook; but he had not lent himself to this\\n\\n\\\"Might 'a' got off on some branch road, by mistake, and waited there, till it was looked up. You see,\\\" the man continued, resting an elbow on, the tall casing of a chest of drawers, and dropping to a more, confidential level in his manner, \\\"an upright piano ain't like a, passenger. It don't kick if it's shunted off on the wrong line. As a, gene'l rule, freight don't complain of the route it travels by, and it, ain't in a hurry to arrive.\\\"\\n\\nI did indeed remember Tedham's affection for his daughter, whom I, remembered as in short frocks when I last saw them together. It was, before my own door in town. Tedham had driven up in a smart buggy behind, a slim sorrel, and I came out, at a sign he made me through the, bow-window with his whip, and saw the little maid on the seat there, beside him. They were both very well dressed, though still in mourning, for the child's mother, and the whole turnout was handsomely set up., Tedham was then about thirty-five, and the child looked about nine. The, color of her hair was the color of his fine brown beard, which had as, yet no trace of gray in it; but the light in her eyes was another light\\n\\nand he was carrying a load that nobody could bear up under. She, addressed these declarations to her lingering consciousness of Ransom, Hilbrook, and confirmed herself, by their repetition, in the belief that, he had not taken her generalizations personally. She now extended these, so as to inculpate the faculty of the university, who ought to have felt, it their duty not to let a man of Ewbert's intellectual quality stagger, on alone among them, with no sign of appreciation or recognition in the, work he was doing, not so much for the Rixonite church as for the whole, community. She took several ladies at the hotel into her confidence on, this point, and upon study of the situation they said it was a shame., After that she felt more bitter about it, and attributed her husband's, collapse to a concealed sense of the indifference of the university, people, so galling to a sensitive nature.\\n\\n\\\"That terrible old man,\\\" she said, \\\"has simply been draining the life, out of you, Clarence. I saw it from the beginning, and I warned you, against it; but you wouldn't listen to me. _Now_ I suppose you _will_, listen, after the doctor tells you that you're in danger of nervous, prostration, and that you've got to give up everything and rest. _I_, think you've been in danger of losing your reason, you've overworked it, so; and I sha'n't be easy till I've got you safely away at the seaside\\n\\n\\\"You asked me just now why I didn't think character, as we call it, gave, us some right to expect a life after this. Well, I'll try to tell you. I, consider that I've been the rounds, as you may say, and that I've got as, much character as most men. I've had about everything in my life that, most have, and a great deal more than some. I've seen that everything, wears out, and that when a thing's worn out it's for good and all. I, think it's reasonable to suppose that when I wear out it will be for, good and all, too. There isn't anything of us, as I look at it, except, the potentiality of experiences. The experiences come through the, passions that you can tell on the fingers of one hand: love, hate, hope\\n\\nGaites thought of all his own anxieties and interferences in behalf of, the piano of this ungrateful girl, and in her presence he resolved that, his lips should be forever sealed concerning them. She never would take, them in the right way. But he experimented with one suggestion. \\\"Perhaps, she was taken with the beautiful name on the piano-case, and couldn't, help telegraphing just for the pleasure of writing it.\\\"\\n\\nI did not go till the following week, when I found that no one had, attempted to snap up the Conwell place. In fact, it rather snapped me, up, I secured it with so little trouble. I reported it so perfect that, all my wife's fears of a latent objection to it were roused again. But, when I said I thought we could relinquish it, her terrors subsided; and, I thought this the right moment to deliver a stroke that I had been, holding in reserve.\\n\\nHe woke to the sound of a quick snort, in which he suspected a terminal, character when he glanced round the semicircle of old ladies and found, them all staring at him. From the pain in his neck he knew that his head, had been hanging forward on his breast, and, in the strong belief that, he had been publicly disgracing himself, he left the place, and went out, on the piazza till his shame should be forgotten. Of course, the sound, of the name Desmond had been as much a part of his dream as the sight of, that pale girl's face; but he felt, while he paced the veranda, the pull, of a strong curiosity to make sure of the fact. From time to time he, looked in through the window, without courage to return. At last, when, the semicircle was reduced to the bulks of the two ladies who had sat, nearest him, he went in, and took a place with a newspaper at the lamp, just behind them.\\n\\nAt last he turned and walked back through the streets of dwellings to, the business centre of the town, where a gush of light came from the, veranda of his hotel, and the druggist's window cast purple and yellow, blurs out upon the footway. The other stores were shut, and he alone, seemed to be abroad. The church clock struck ten as he mounted the steps, of his hotel and dropped the remnant of his cigar over the side.\\n\\nand I added, with no great relevancy, that my wife and I were renewing, the fond emotion of our first trip down the St. Lawrence in the, character of bridal pair which we had spurned when it was really ours. I, explained that we had left the children with my wife's aunt, so as to, render the travesty more lifelike; and when he said, \\\"I suppose you miss, them, though,\\\" I gave him my card. He tried to find one of his own to, give me in return, but he could only find a lot of other people's cards., He wrote his name on the back of one, and handed it to me with a smile., \\\"It won't do for me to put 'reverend' before it, in my own chirography\\n\\nbut it could certainly be contrived, and he began to dramatize their, meeting on these various terms. It was interesting and it was, delightful, and it always came, in its safe impossibility, to his, telling her that he loved her, and to her consenting to be his wife. He, resolved to take no chance of losing her, but to remain awake, and, somehow see her before she could leave the hotel in the morning. The, resolution gave him calm; he felt that the affair so far was settled.\\n\\nwith a preoccupied air, to the open door where we stood waiting. There, were two great syringa-bushes on each hand close to the portal, which, were in full flower, and which flung their sweetness through the doorway, and the windows; but when we found ourselves in the dim old-fashioned, parlor, we were aware of this odor meeting and mixing with another which, descended from the floor above--the smell of some medicated pastille., There was a sound of anxious steps overhead, and a hurried closing of, doors, with the mechanical sound of labored breathing.\\n\\n\\\"She couldn't, I dare say, by any of the old romantic methods of a, convent or disinheritance; but she is an invalid; she wants to keep her, daughter with her, and she avails with the girl's conscience by being, simply dependent and obstructive. The young people have carried their, engagement through, and now such hope as they have is fixed upon her, finally yielding in the matter of their marriage, though Glendenning was, obliged to confess that there was no sign of her doing so. They, agree--Miss Bentley and he--that they cannot get married as they got, engaged, in spite of her mother--it would be unclerical if it wouldn't, be unfilial--and they simply have to bide their time.\\\"\\n\\nHe had not meant his politeness for an overture to her acquaintance, but, he felt as justly snubbed as if he had; and he sank back into his seat, in some disorder. He tried to hide his confusion behind the newspaper he, opened between them; but from time to time he had a glimpse of her round, the side of it, and he saw that the hand which clutched her bag all the, while tightened upon it and then loosened nervously.\\n\\n\\\"And, by-the-way,\\\" she added, with the logic of her sex, \\\"I'm just going, to the station to see what's become of a trunk myself that I ordered, expressed from Chicago a week ago. If you're not doing anything this, morning--the tide isn't in till noon, and there'll be little or no, bathing to look at before that--you'd better drive down with me. Or, perhaps you're canoeing up the river with somebody?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, nothing. Only, all at once I realized that he had a sensitive, nature. I don't know why I shouldn't have realized it before. I had, somehow taken it for granted that he was a self-conscious hermit, who, lived in a squalid seclusion because he liked being wondered at. But he, did not seem to be anything of the kind. I don't know whether he's a, good cook, for he didn't ask me to eat anything; but I don't think he's, a bad housekeeper.\\\"\\n\\nHe knew that the fact which their words veiled was now the first thing, in their mutual consciousness. He spoke the truth in saying, \\\"No, I, never wanted to,\\\" but this was only a mechanical truth, and he knew it., He had an impulse to put the burden of the situation on her, and press, her to say why she thought he wished to do so; but his next emotion was, shame for this impulse. A thousand times, in these reveries in which he, had imagined meeting her, he had told her first of all how he had, overheard her talking in the room next his own in the hotel, and of the, power her voice had instantly and lastingly had upon him. But now, with, a sense spiritualized by her presence, he perceived that this, if it was, not unworthy, was secondary, and that the right to say it was not yet, established. There was something that must come before this,--something, that could alone justify him in any further step. If she could answer, him first as he wished, then he might open his whole heart to her, at, whatever cost; he was not greatly to blame, if he did not realize that, the cost could not be wholly his, as he asked, remotely enough from her, question, \\\"After I wrote that I was coming up here, and you did not, answer me, did you think I was coming?\\\"\\n\\nLangbourne replied that he was going up to Springfield on business the, first week in May, and that he thought he might push on as far north as, Upper Ashton Falls. To this there came no rejoinder whatever, but he did, not lose courage. It was now the end of April, and he could bear to wait, for a further verification of his ideal; the photograph had confirmed, him in its evasive fashion at every point of his conjecture concerning, her. It was the face he had imagined her having, or so he now imagined\\n\\nGaites wondered why he felt suddenly angry; why he resented the head, waiter's blush as an impertinence and a liberty. After all, the fellow, was a student and probably a gentleman; and if he chose to help himself, through college by taking that menial role during the summer, rather, than come upon the charity of his friends or the hard-earned savings of, a poor old father, what had any one to say against it? Gaites had, nothing to say against it; and yet that blush, that embarrassment of a, man who had pulled out his chair for him, in relation to such a girl as, Miss Phyllis Desmond, incensed him so much that he could not enjoy his, supper. He did not bow to the head waiter when he held the netting-door, open for him to go out, and he felt the necessity of taking the evening, air in another stroll to cool himself off.\\n\\nI do not know whether she will live as long as her mother, who seems to, have taken a fresh lease of years from her single act of self-sacrifice., I cannot say whether Mrs. Bentley feels herself deceived and defrauded, by her daughter's recovery; but I have made my wife observe that it, would be just like life if she bore the young couple a sort of grudge, for unwittingly outwitting her. Certainly, on the day we lately spent, with them all at Gormanville, she seemed, in the slight attack of asthma, from which she suffered, to come as heavily and exactingly upon both as, she used to come upon her daughter alone. But I was glad to see that, Glendenning eagerly bore the greater part of the common burden. He grows, stouter and stouter, and will soon be the figure of a bishop.\\n\\nGaites found some notable changes in the hotel at Lower Merritt since he, had last sojourned there. It no longer called itself a Hotel, but an, Inn, and it had a brand-new old-fashioned swinging sign before its door;, its front had been cut up into several gables, and shingled to the, ground with shingles artificially antiquated, so that it looked much, grayer than it naturally ought. Within it was equipped for electric, lighting; and there was a low-browed aesthetic parlor, where, when Gaites, arrived and passed to a belated dinner in the dining-room, an orchestra\\n\\nthat the son of an older church than the Rixonite might have found in, this thoroughly terrestrial attitude of his wife a potent argument for, sacerdotal celibacy; but he did not attempt to formulate it, and he, listened submissively while she went on: \\\"_One_ thing: I am certainly, not going to let you see him again till you've seen the doctor, and I, hope he won't come about. If he does, _I_ shall see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm ready,\\\" said my wife, and she continued with her eyes still on the, glass: \\\"He's got a church out in Ohio, somewhere; but he's a, New-Englander, and he's quite wild to get back. He thinks those people, are from Boston: I could tell in a moment if I saw them. Well, now, I, _am_ ready,\\\" and with this she really ceased to do something to her, hair, and came out into the long saloon with me where the table was set., Rows of passengers stood behind the rows of chairs, with a detaining, grasp on nearly all of them. We gazed up and down in despair. Suddenly, Mrs. March sped forward, and I found that Mr. Glendenning had made a, sign to her from a distant point, where there were two vacant chairs for, us next his own. We eagerly laid hands on them, and waited for the gong, to sound for dinner. In this interval an elderly lady followed by a, young girl came down the saloon toward us, and I saw signs, or rather, emotions, of intelligence pass between Mr. Glendenning and Mrs. March, concerning them.\\n\\nthough he was not reticent about it. I proposed the history of his, cousin in the boyish days which he said they had spent together; but he, seemed no more interested in his cousin than in himself. Then I tried, his dog and his pathetic sufferings, and I said something about the pity, of the poor old fellow's last days being so miserable. That seemed to, strike a gleam of interest from him, and he asked me if I thought, animals might live again. And I found--I don't know just how to put it, so as to give you the right sense of his psychological attitude.\\\"\\n\\nThat night, before the Ewberts had finished their tea, there came a ring, at the door, from which Mrs. Ewbert disconsolately foreboded a premature, evening call. \\\"And just when I was counting on a long, quiet, restful, time for you, and getting you to bed early!\\\" she lamented in undertone, to her husband; to the maid who passed through the room with an, inquiring glance, to the front door, she sighed, still in undertone, \\\"Oh, yes, of course we're at _home_.\\\"\\n\\nThe young lady did not seem to care so much for this, and when she, thanked my wife in leaving the table with her mother, and begged her to, thank the gentlemen who had so kindly given up their places, she made no, overture to further acquaintance. In fact, we had been so simply and, merely made use of that, although we were rather meek people, we decided, to avoid our beneficiaries for the rest of the day; and Mr. Glendenning\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't be--impious, Basil,\\\" said my wife, with a moment's, hesitation for the word. Then she sighed and added, \\\"Yes, it seems as if, that would be the only thing that could end it. There doesn't really, seem to be any provision in life for ending such things. He will have to, go on and make more and more trouble. Poor man! I feel almost as sorry, for him as I do for her. I guess he hasn't expiated his sin yet, as, fully as he thinks he has.\\\"\\n\\nwith her hair of cloudy red and her large, dim-sighted eyes, it played, upon the spiritual sense within him with the coaxing, drolling, mocking, charm which he had felt from the first. It blessed him with intelligent, and joyous forgiveness. But as he stood at her gate that evening this, unmerited felicity fell from him. He now really heard her voice, through, the open doorway, but perhaps because it was mixed with other, voices--the treble of Miss Bingham, and the bass of a man who must be, the Mr. Dickery he had seen at the saw mills--he turned and hurried back, to his hotel, where he wrote a short letter saying that he had decided, to take the express for New York that night. With an instinctive, recognition of her authority in the affair, or with a cowardly shrinking, from direct dealing with Barbara, he wrote to Juliet Bingham, and he, addressed to her the packet of letters which he sent for Barbara., Superficially, he had done what he had no choice but to do. He had been, asked to return her letters, and he had returned them, and brought the, affair to an end.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see how you could have been more so!\\\" she retorted, in tender, indignation with him against himself. \\\"And I think what he said was, terrible. It was bad enough for him to pretend to believe that he was, not going to live again, but for him to tell you that he was _afraid_ he, was!\\\" An image sufficiently monstrous to typify Hilbrook's wickedness, failed to present itself to Mrs. Ewbert, and she went out to give the, maid instructions for something unusually nourishing for Ewbert at their, mid-day dinner. \\\"You look fairly fagged out, Clarence,\\\" she said, when, she came back; \\\"and I insist upon your not going up to that dreadful old, man's again,--at least, not till you've got over this shock.\\\"\\n\\nHe had not dwelt so long and so intently on the meeting at hand without, considering how he should account for his coming, and he had formulated, a confession of his motives. But he had never meant to make it to Juliet, Bingham, and he now found himself unable to allege a word in explanation, of his presence. He followed her into the parlor. Barbara silently gave, him her hand and then remained passive in the background, where Dickery, held aloof, smiling in what seemed his perpetual enjoyment of the Juliet, Bingham joke. She at once put herself in authority over the situation;, she made Langbourne let her have his hat; she seated him when and where, she chose; she removed and put back the lampshades; she pulled up and, pulled down the window-blinds; she shut the outer door because of the, night air, and opened it because of the unseasonable warmth within. She, excused Mrs. Simpson's absence on account of a headache, and asked him, if he would not have a fan; when he refused it she made him take it, and, while he sat helplessly dangling it from his hand, she asked him about, the summer he had had, and whether he had passed it in New York. She was, very intelligent about the heat in New York, and tactful in keeping the, one-sided talk from falling. Barbara said nothing after a few faint, attempts to take part in it, and Langbourne made briefer and briefer, answers. His reticence seemed only to heighten Juliet Bingham's, satisfaction, and she said, with a final supremacy, that she had been, intending to go out with Mr. Dickery to a business meeting of the, book-club, but they would be back before Langbourne could get away; she, made him promise to wait for them. He did not know if Barbara looked any, protest,--at least she spoke none,--and Juliet went out with Dickery., She turned at the door to bid Barbara say, if any one called, that she, was at the book-club meeting. Then she disappeared, but reappeared and, called, \\\"See here, a minute, Bab!\\\" and at the outer threshold she, detained Barbara in vivid whisper, ending aloud, \\\"Now you be sure to do, both, Bab! Aunt Elmira will tell you where the things are.\\\" Again she, vanished, and was gone long enough to have reached the gate and come, back from it. She was renewing all her whispered and out-spoken charges, when Dickery showed himself at her side, put his hand under her elbow\\n\\nThe older of these ladies was a tall, handsome matron, who bore her, fifty years with a native severity qualified by a certain air of wonder, at a world which I could well fancy had not always taken her at her own, estimate of her personal and social importance. She had the effect of, challenging you to do less, as she advanced slowly between the wall of, state-rooms and the backs of the people gripping their chairs, and eyed, them with a sort of imperious surprise that they should have left no, place for her. So at least I read her glance, while I read in that of, the young lady coming after, and showing her beauty first over this, shoulder and then over that of her mother, chiefly a present amusement\\n\\nseriously, to thank me for talking Glendenning out of his morbid mood., With the frankness sometimes characteristic of her she said that if he, had released her, it would have made no difference--she should still, have felt herself bound to him; and until he should tell her that he no, longer cared for her, she should feel that he was bound to her. I saw no, great originality in this reproduction of my own ideas. But when Miss, Bentley added that she believed her mother herself would be shocked and, disappointed if they were to give each other up, I was aware of being in, the presence of a curious psychological fact. I so wholly lost myself in, the inquiry it invited that I let the talk flow on round me unheeded, while I questioned whether Mrs. Bentley did not derive a satisfaction, from her own and her daughter's mutual opposition which she could never, have enjoyed from their perfect agreement. She had made a certain, concession in consenting to the engagement, and this justified her to, herself in refusing her consent to the marriage, while the ingratitude, of the young people in not being content with what she had done formed a, grievance of constant avail with a lady of her temperament. From what, Miss Bentley let fall, half seriously, half jokingly, as well as what I, observed, I divined a not unnatural effect of the strained relations, between her and her mother. She concentrated whatever resentment she, felt upon Miss Bentley, insomuch that it seemed as though she might, altogether have withdrawn her opposition if it had been a question, merely of Glendenning's marriage. So far from disliking him, she was, rather fond of him, and she had no apparent objection to him except as, her daughter's husband. It had not always been so; at first she had an, active rancor against him; but this had gradually yielded to his, invincible goodness and sweetness.\\n\\nand when she said she had not seen it, he sent it her; in one of her, letters she casually betrayed that she sang contralto in the choir, and, then he sent her some new songs, which he had heard in the theatre, and, which he had informed himself from a friend were contralto. He was, always tending to an expression of the feeling which swayed him; but on, her part there was no sentiment. Only in the fact that she was willing, to continue this exchange of letters with a man personally unknown to, her did she betray that romantic tradition which underlies all our young, life, and in those unused to the world tempts to things blameless in, themselves, but of the sort shunned by the worldlier wise. There was no, great wisdom of any kind in Miss Simpson's letters; but Langbourne did, not miss it; he was content with her mere words, as they related the, little events of her simple daily life. These repeated themselves from, the page in the tones of her voice and filled him with a passionate, intoxication.\\n\\nin the regret which the words conveyed. It appeared that it was not he, who had done the wrong; he had suffered it, and so far from having to, offer reparation to a young girl for having unwarrantably wrought her up, expect of him a step from which he afterwards recoiled, he had the duty, of forgiving her a trespass on his own invaded sensibilities. It was, humiliating to his vanity; it inflicted a hurt to something better than, his vanity. He began very uncomfortably: \\\"It's all right, as far as I'm, concerned. I had no business to address Miss Simpson in the first, place--\\\"\\n\\nhowever, she had gone down herself with Birkwall; and it showed what a, woman could do when she took anything in hand. Without knowing of her, approach except by telepathy, the railroad people had bestirred, themselves, and she had seen them with her own eyes put the piano-case, into a car, and had waited till the train had bumped and jolted off with, it towards Mewers Junction. All the ladies of her supper party, she, declared, had been keenly distressed at the delay of the piano in, Burymouth, and she was now offering him the relief which she had shared, already with them.\\n\\nAll the way back to New York Langbourne was oppressed by a sense of loss, such as his old disappointment in love now seemed to him never to have, inflicted. He found that his whole being had set toward the unseen owner, of the voice which had charmed him, and it was like a stretching and, tearing of the nerves to be going from her instead of going to her. He, was as much under duress as if he were bound by a hypnotic spell. The, voice continually sounded, not in his ears, which were filled with the, noises of the train, as usual, but in the inmost of his spirit, where it, was a low, cooing, coaxing murmur. He realized now how intensely he must, have listened for it in the night, how every tone of it must have, pervaded him and possessed him. He was in love with it, he was as, entirely fascinated by it as if it were the girl's whole presence, her, looks, her qualities. The remnant of the summer passed in the fret of, business, which was doubly irksome through his feeling of injury in, being kept from the girl whose personality he constructed from the sound, of her voice, and set over his fancy in an absolute sovereignty. The, image he had created of her remained a dim and blurred vision throughout, the day, but by night it became distinct and compelling. One evening\\n\\n\\\"I didn't approve of it, Basil; but if you felt so strongly that you, ought to do it, I felt that I ought to let you. I have never interfered, with your sense of duty, and I never will. But I am glad that you didn't, feel it your duty to that wretch to go and make more trouble on his, account. He has made quite enough already; and it wasn't his fault that, you were not tried and convicted in his place.\\\"\\n\\nThis was fortunate for Miss Desmond, who wished to talk of nothing else., The piano had arrived in perfect condition. \\\"But I don't know where the, poor thing _hasn't_ been, on the way,\\\" said the girl. \\\"It left Boston, fully two weeks ago, and it seems to have been wandering round to the, ends of the earth ever since. The first of last week, I heard from it at, Kent Harbor, of all places! I got a long despatch from there, from some, unknown female, telling me it had broken down on the way to Burymouth\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I fancy I was looking up the New York trains,\\\" Langbourne returned., He did not like these evasions, but in his consciousness of Miss Simpson, he seemed unable to avoid them. The clerk went out on the veranda to, talk with a farmer bringing supplies, and Langbourne ran to the, register, and read there the names of Barbara F. Simpson and Juliet D., Bingham. It was Miss Simpson who had registered for both, since her name, came first, and the entry was in a good, simple hand, which was like a, man's in its firmness and clearness. He turned from the register decided, to take the four-o'clock train for Upper Ashton Falls, and met a, messenger with a telegram which he knew was for himself before the boy, could ask his name. His partner had fallen suddenly sick; his recall was, absolute, his vacation was at an end; nothing remained for him but to, take the first train back to New York. He thought how little prescient, he had been in his pretence that he was looking the New York trains up;, but the need of one had come already, and apparently he should never, have any use for a train to Upper Ashton Falls.\\n\\nHe continued: \\\"I consider that I have expiated the wrong I did. There is, no sense in the whole thing, if I haven't. They might as well have let, me go in the beginning. Don't you think that ten years out of my life is, enough for a thing that I never intended to go as far as it did, and a, thing that I was led into, partly, for the sake of others? I have tried, to reason it out, and not from my own point of view at all, and that is, the way I feel about it. Is it to go on forever, and am I never to be, rid of the consequences of a single act? If you and Mr. March could, condone--\\\"\\n\\nOn a side track stood a freight-car, from which the customary men in, silk caps were pulling the freight, and standing it about loosely on the, platform. The car was detached from the parent train, which had left it, not only orphaned on this siding, but apparently disabled; for Gaites, heard the men talking about not having cut it out a minute too soon. One, of them called, in at the broad low door, to some one inside, \\\"All out?\\\", and a voice from far within responded, \\\"Case here, yet; _I_ can't handle, it alone.\\\"\\n\\nLangbourne went to bed as soon as he reached his hotel because he found, himself spent with the experience of the evening; but as he rested from, his fatigue he grew wakeful, and he tried to get its whole measure and, meaning before him. He had a methodical nature, with a necessity for, order in his motions, and he now balanced one fact against another none, the less passionately because the process was a series of careful, recognitions. He perceived that the dream in which he had lived for the, year past was not wholly an illusion. One of the girls whom he had heard, but not seen was what he had divined her to be: a dominant influence, a, control to which the other was passively obedient. He had not erred, greatly as to the face or figure of the superior, but he had given all, the advantages to the wrong person. The voice, indeed, the spell which, had bound him, belonged with the one to whom he had attributed it, and, the qualities with which it was inextricably blended in his fancy were, hers; she was more like his ideal than the other, though he owned that, the other was a charming girl too, and that in the thin treble of her, voice lurked a potential fascination which might have made itself, ascendently felt if he had happened to feel it first.\\n\\nThe wonder was that he should ever have been roused from his apathetic, unfaith to inquiry concerning the world beyond this, and to a certain, degree of belief in possibilities long abandoned by his imagination., Ewbert had assisted at the miracle of this resuscitation upon terms, which, until he was himself much older, he could not question as to, their beneficence, and in fact it never came to his being quite frank, with himself concerning them. He kept his thoughts on this point in that, state of solution which holds so many conjectures from precipitation in, actual conviction.\\n\\nI thought perhaps that she was in the habit from pride, or something, like it, of holding herself in check, and that this blameless excess, which I saw was the natural expansion from an inner constraint. But what, I really knew was that the young people got on very rapidly, in an, acquaintance that prospered up to the last moment I saw them together., This was just before the _Corinthian_ drew up to her landing at, Montreal, when Miss Bentley (we had learned her name) came to us from, the point where she was standing with Glendenning and said that now she, must go to her mother, and took a sweet leave of my wife. She asked, where we were going to stay in Montreal and whether we were going on to, Quebec; and said her mother would wish to send Mrs. March her card.\\n\\nThey both got by us, and I could see Mr. Glendenning following them with, longing but irresolute eyes, until they turned, a long way down the, saloon, as if to come toward us again. Then he hurried to meet them, and, as he addressed himself first to one and then to the other, I knew him, to be offering them his chair. So did my wife, and she said, \\\"You must, give up your place too, Basil,\\\" and I said I would if she wished to see, me starve on the spot. But of course I went and joined Glendenning in, his entreaties that they would deprive us of our chances of dinner (I, knew what the second table was on the _Corinthian_); and I must say that, the elder lady accepted my chair in the spirit which my secret grudge, deserved. She made me feel as if I ought to have offered it when they, first passed us; but it was some satisfaction to learn afterwards that, she gave Mrs. March, for her ready sacrifice of me, as bad a half-hour, as she ever had. She sat next to my wife, and the young lady took, Glendenning's place, and as soon as we had left them she began trying to, find out from Mrs. March who he was, and what his relation to us was., The girl tried to check her at first, and then seemed to give it up, and, devoted herself to being rather more amiable than she otherwise might, have been, my wife thought, in compensation for the severity of her, mother's scrutiny. Her mother appeared disposed to hold Mrs. March, responsible for knowing little or nothing about Mr. Glendenning.\\n\\nAt one time he had it on his tongue to say that there seemed to be, something like infection in his interest in that piano, and he was going, to speak of the young girl who seemed to share it, simply because she, saw him staring at it, and who faltered so long with him before the, freight-depot that she came near getting no seat in the train for, Burymouth. But just at that moment the dispute about the Ashwoods, renewed itself upon some fresh evidence which one of the ladies, recollected and offered; and Gaites's chance passed. When it came again, he had no longer the wish to seize it. A lingering soreness from his, experience with that young girl made itself felt in his nether, consciousness. He forbore the more easily because, mixed with this pain\\n\\nHe had not tried to characterize the university by his peculiar, religious faith, but he had given a church building, a parsonage, and a, fund for the support of preaching among them at Hilbrook to the small, body of believers to which his people adhered. This sect had a name by, which it was officially known to itself; but, like the Shakers, the, Quakers, the Moravians, it early received a nickname, which it passively, adopted, and even among its own members the body was rarely spoken of or, thought of except as the Rixonites.\\n\\nWhen her attack passed off, Mrs. Bentley sent and begged my wife to come, again and see her. She went without me, while I was in town, but she was, so circumstantial in her report of her visit, when I came home, that I, never felt quite sure I had not been present. What most interested us, both was the extreme independence which the mother and daughter showed, beyond a certain point, and the daughter's great frankness in expressing, her difference of feeling. We had already had some hint of this, the, first day we met her, and we were not surprised at it now, my wife at, first hand, or I at second hand. Mrs. Bentley opened the way for her, daughter by saying that the worst of sickness was that it made one such, an affliction to others. She lived in an atmosphere of devotion, she, said, but her suffering left her so little of life that she could not, help clinging selfishly to everything that remained.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said. \\\"It is Tedham,\\\" and I held out my hand, with no definite, intention, I believe, but merely because I did know him, and this was, the usual form of greeting between acquaintances after a long, separation, or even a short one, for that matter. But he seemed to find, a special significance in my civility, and he took my hand and held it, silently, while he was trying to speak. Evidently, he could not, and I, said aimlessly, \\\"What were you throwing at?\\\"\\n\\nlate in the fall, he could endure the stress no longer, and he yielded, to the temptation which had beset him from the first moment he renounced, his purpose of returning in person the circular addressed to her as a, means of her acquaintance. He wrote to her, and in terms as dignified as, he could contrive, and as free from any ulterior import, he told her he, had found it in the hotel hallway and had meant to send it to her at, once, thinking it might be of some slight use to her. He had failed to, do this, and now, having come upon it among some other papers, he sent, it with an explanation which he hoped she would excuse him for troubling, her with.\\n\\n\\\"Now, how unhandsome life is!\\\" I broke out, at one point on our way, home, after we had turned the affair over in every light, and then, dropped it, and then taken it up again. \\\"It's so graceless, so, tasteless! Why didn't Tedham die before the expiration of his term and, solve all this knotty problem with dignity? Why should he have lived on, in this shabby way and come out and wished to see his daughter? If there, had been anything dramatic, anything artistic in the man's nature, he, would have renounced the claim his mere paternity gives him on her love\\n\\nthe segment of a crescent eyebrow. The girl said that as they should, probably never meet, it was not necessary he should know her when he saw, her; she explained that she was looking away because she had been, attracted by something on the other side of the photograph gallery just, at the moment the artist took the cap off the tube of his camera, and, she could not turn back without breaking the plate.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course it will come right in time,\\\" said my wife when they were, gone, and I agreed that they need only have patience. We had all talked, ourselves into a cheerful frame concerning the affair; we had seen it in, its amusing aspects, and laughed about it; and that seemed almost in, itself to dispose of Mrs. Bentley's opposition. My wife and I decided, that this could not long continue; that by-and-by she would become tired, of it, and this would happen all the sooner if the lovers submitted, absolutely, and did nothing to remind her of their submission.\\n\\nWhat remained for him to do was to arrange for his departure by the, first train in the morning; and he was subjectively accounting to the, landlord for his abrupt change of mind after he had engaged his room for, a week, while he was intent with all his upper faculties upon the, graceful poses and movements of Miss Axewright. There was something so, appealing in the pressure of her soft chin as it held the violin in, place against her round, girlish throat that Gaites felt a lump in his, own larger than his Adam's-apple would account for to the spectator; the, delicately arched wrist of the hand that held the bow, and the, rhythmical curve and flow of her arm in playing, were means of the spell, which wove itself about him, and left him, as it were, bound hand and, foot. It was in this helpless condition that he rose at the urgence of a, friendly young fellow who had chosen himself master of ceremonies, and, took part in the dancing; and at the end of the first half of the, programme, while the other dancers streamed out on the verandas and, thronged the stairways, he was aware of dangling his chains as he, lounged toward the ladies of the orchestra. The volunteer master of, ceremonies had half shut himself across the piano in his eager talk with, Miss Desmond, and he readily relinquished Miss Axewright to Gaites, who, willingly devoted himself to her, after Miss Desmond had risen in, acknowledgment of his bow. He had then perceived that she was not nearly, so tall as she had seemed when seated; and a woman who sat tall and, stood low was as much his aversion as if his own abnormally long legs, did not render him guilty of the opposite offence.\\n\\npainted a wornout white, as far as it was solid, which was to the height, of one's shoulder; there it opened into a panel work of sticks crossed, X-wise, which wore a coat of aged green; the strip above them was set, with a bristling row of rusty nails, which were supposed to keep out, people who could perfectly well have gone in at the gate as we did., There was a brick walk from the gate to the door, which was not so far, back as I remembered it (perhaps because the leaves were now off the, trees), and there was a border of box on either side of the walk., Altogether there was an old-fashioned keeping in the place which I, should have rather enjoyed if I had been coming on any other errand; but, now it imparted to me a notion of people set in their ways, of something, severe, something hopelessly forbidding.\\n\\nat that early moment of her desolation. She had something of poor, Tedham's own style and grace, too, which had served him so ill, and this, heightened the pathos for me. In that figure I had thought of his, daughter ever since, as often as I had thought of her at all; which was, not very often, to tell the truth, after the first painful impression of, Tedham's affair began to die away in me, or to be effaced by the, accumulating cares and concerns of my own life. But now that we had, returned into the presence of that bitter sorrow, as it were, the little, thing reappeared vividly to me in just the way I had seen her so long, ago. My sense of her forlornness, of her most hapless orphanhood, was, intensified by the implacable hate with which Mrs. Hasketh had then, spoken of her father, in telling us that the child was henceforth to, bear her husband's name, and had resentfully scorned the merit Tedham, tried to make of giving her up to them. \\\"And if I can help it,\\\" she had, ended, with a fierceness I had never forgotten, \\\"she shall not hear him, mentioned again, or see him as long as I live.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thought there wa'n't much in it? Well, that's right, generally, speakin'. Folks like to make up stories about a man that lives alone, like me, here; and they usually get in a disappointment. I ain't goin', to go over it. I don't care any more about it now than if it had, happened to somebody else; but it did happen. Josiah got the girl, and I, didn't. I presume they like to make out that I've grieved over it ever, since. Sho! It's forty years since I gave it a thought, that way.\\\" A, certain contemptuous indignation supplanted the wonted gentleness of the, old man, as if he spurned the notion of such sentimental folly. \\\"I've, read of folks mournin' all their lives through, and in their old age, goin' back to a thing like that, as if it still meant somethin'. But it, ain't true; I don't suppose I care any more for losin' her now than, Josiah would for gettin' her if he was alive. It did make a difference, for a while; I ain't goin' to deny that. It lasted me four or five, years, in all, I guess; but I was married to somebody else when I went, to the war,\\\"--Ewbert controlled a start of surprise; he had always taken, it for granted that Hilbrook was a bachelor,--\\\"and we had one child. So, you may say that I was well over that first thing. _It wore out_; and if, it wa'n't that it makes me mad to have folks believin' that I'm, sufferin' from it yet, I presume I shouldn't think of it from one year's, end to another. My wife and I always got on well together; she was a, good woman. She died when I was away at the war, and the little boy died, after I got back. I was sorry to lose her, and I thought losin' _him_, would kill me. It didn't. It appeared one while as if I couldn't live, without him, and I was always contrivin' how I should meet up with him, somewhere else. I couldn't figure it out.\\\"\\n\\nSo it seemed to him in those flaccid moods to which Hilbrook's visits, left him, when mind and body were both spent in the effort he had been, making. In the intervals in which his strength renewed itself, he put, this fear from him as a hypochondriacal fancy, and he summoned a, cheerfulness which he felt less and less to meet the hopeful face of the, old man. Hilbrook had renewed himself, apparently, in the measure that, the minister had aged and waned. He looked, to Ewbert, younger and, stronger. To the conventional question how he did, he one night answered, that he never felt better in his life. \\\"But you,\\\" he said, casting an, eye over the face and figure of the minister, who lay back in his, easy-chair, with his hands stretched nerveless on the arms, \\\"_you_, look, rather peaked. I don't know as I noticed it before, but come to think, I, seemed to feel the same way about it when I saw you in the pulpit, yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we speak of Nature, we figure her as one thing, with a fixed, purpose and office in the universal economy; but she is an immense, number of things, and her functions are inexpressibly varied. She, includes decay as well as growth; she compasses death as well as birth., We call certain phenomena unnatural; but in a natural world how can, anything be unnatural, except the supernatural? These facts gave Ewbert, pause in view of the obstinate behavior of Ransom Hilbrook in dying for, no obvious reason, and kept him from pronouncing it unnatural. The old, man, he reflected, had really less reason to live than to die, if it, came to reasons; for everything that had made the world home to him had, gone out of it, and left him in exile here. The motives had ceased; the, interests had perished; the strong personality that had persisted was, solitary amid the familiar environment grown alien.\\n\\nHe did not know where Miss Simpson lived; and the courage with which he, had set out on his adventure totally lapsed, leaving in its place an, accusing sense of silliness. He was where he was without reason, and in, defiance of the tacit unwillingness of the person he had come to see;, she certainly had given him no invitation, she had given him no, permission to come. For the moment, in his shame, it seemed to him that, the only thing for him was to go back to New York by the first train in, the morning. But what then would the girl think of him? Such an act must, forever end the intercourse which had now become an essential part of, his life. That voice which had haunted him so long, was he never to hear, it again? Was he willing to renounce forever the hope of hearing it?\\n\\nI perceived that no moral scruple presented itself to him; when it came, to the point, he was simply and naturally a lover, like any other man;, and I persisted: \\\"It would only be a seven days' wonder. I never heard, of a clergyman's running away to be married; but they must have, sometimes done it. Come, I don't believe you'd have to plead hard with, Miss Bentley, and Mrs. March and I will aid and abet you to the limit of, our small ability. I'm sure that if I wrap up warm against the night, air, she will let me go and help you hold the rope-ladder taut.\\\"\\n\\nI thought that my wife, in the effusion of sympathy, would have perhaps, taken the girl in her arms; but probably she knew that the dropped veil, was a sign that there was to be no embracing. She put out her hand, and, the girl took it with her gloved hand; but though the outward forms of, their greeting were so cold, I fancied an instant understanding and, kindness between them.\\n\\n\\\"I believe you're thinking of making a sermon on that,\\\" she retorted;, and he gave a sad, consenting laugh, as if it were quite true, though in, fact he never really preached a sermon on mere femininity or mere, mortality. His sermons were all very good, however; and that was another, thing that put her out of patience with his Rixonite parishioners--that, they should sit there Sunday after Sunday, year in and year out, and, listen to his beautiful sermons, which ought to melt their hearts and, bring tears into their eyes, and not seem influenced by them any more, than if they were so many dry chips.\\n\\n\\\"There never is an end to a thing like this!\\\" she returned, with a, passionate sigh of pity. \\\"Oh, what a terrible thing an evil deed is! It, _can't_ end. It has to go on and on forever. Poor wretch! He thought he, had got to the end of his misdeed, when he had suffered the punishment, for it, but it was only just beginning then! Now, you see, it has a, perfectly new lease of life. It's as if it had just happened, as far as, the worst consequences are concerned.\\\"\\n\\nBy the time he arrived at Upper Ashton Falls the afternoon had waned so, far towards evening that the first robins were singing their vespers, from the leafless choirs of the maples before the hotel. He indulged the, landlord in his natural supposition that he had come up to make a timely, engagement for summer board; after supper he even asked what the price, of such rooms as his would be by the week in July, while he tried to, lead the talk round to the fact which he wished to learn.\\n\\nGaites was so furious when he got back to the smoking-room of the, parlor-car that he was sorry for several miles that he had not turned, back and kicked the man, even if it lost him his train. But this was, only while he was under the impression that he was furious with the man., When he discovered that he was furious with himself, for having been all, imaginable kinds of an ass, he perceived that he had done the wisest, thing he could in leaving the man to himself, and taking up the line of, his journey again. What remained mortifying was that he had bought his, ticket and checked his bag to Lower Merritt, which he wished never to, hear of again, much less see.\\n\\nNow he saw and understood at last that what his heart had more than once, misgiven him might be the truth, and that though she had sent back his, letters, and asked her own in return, it was not necessarily her wish, that he should obey her request. It might very well have been an, experiment of his feeling towards her, a mute quest of the impression, she had made upon him, a test of his will and purpose, an overture to a, clearer and truer understanding between them. This misgiving became a, conviction from which he could not escape.\\n\\nIf he had been younger, he would have had no doubt as to his right in, the circumstances. He had simply corresponded all winter with Miss, Simpson; but though he had opened his heart freely and had invited her, to the same confidence with him, he had not committed himself, and he, had a right to drop the whole affair. She would have no right to, complain; she had not committed herself either: they could both come off, unscathed. But he was now thirty-five, and life had taught him something, concerning the rights of others which he could not ignore. By seeking, her confidence and by offering her his, he had given her a claim which, was none the less binding because it was wholly tacit. There had been a, time when he might have justified himself in dropping the affair; that, was when she had failed to answer his letter; but he had come to see her, in defiance of her silence, and now he could not withdraw, simply, because he was disappointed, without cruelty, without atrocity.\\n\\n\\\"It was more like death. Several times I was on the point of going, but, you know when there's been a painful scene you feel so sorry for the, people who've made it that you can't bear to leave them to themselves. I, did get up to go, once, in mere self-defence, but they both urged me to, stay, and I couldn't help staying till they could talk of other things., But now tell me what you think of it all. Which should your feeling be, with the most? That is what I want to get at before I tell you mine.\\\"\\n\\nand if possible our help, in a matter about which she had already, consulted the doctor. \\\"The doctor says that the excitement cannot hurt, Edith; it may even help her, to propose it. I should like to do it, but, if you do not think well of it, I will not do it. I know it is too late, now to make up to her for the past,\\\" said Mrs. Bentley, and here she, gave way to the grief she had restrained hitherto.\\n\\nHe believed too late that he had made a mistake, that he had thrown away, the supreme chance of his life. But was it too late? When he could bear, it no longer, he began to deny that it was too late. He denied it even, to the pathetic presence which haunted him, and in which the magic of, her voice itself was merged at last, so that he saw her more than he, heard her. He overbore her weak will with his stronger will, and set, himself strenuously to protest to her real presence what he now always, said to her phantom. When his partner came back from his vacation\\n\\n\\\"Wait a moment,\\\" cried Juliet Bingham, and she gulped the last draught, of her lemonade upon a final morsel of sponge-cake, and was down at the, piano while still dusting the crumbs from her fingers. She struck the, refractory sheet of music flat upon the rack with her palm, and then, tilted her head over her shoulder towards Langbourne, who had risen with, some vague notion of turning the sheets of the song. \\\"Do you sing?\\\"\\n\\nconclusions, in which there was nothing final but the decision that we, must not dream of going there; that it would look like thrusting, ourselves in, and would be in the worst sort of taste; they would all, hate us, and we should feel that we were spies upon the young people;, for of course the Bentleys had got Glendenning there to marry him, and, in effect did not want any one to witness the disgraceful spectacle.\\n\\nMrs. Ewbert broke down in her turn. \\\"I don't know _what_ I'm saying!\\\", she retorted from behind her handkerchief. \\\"I'm trying to show you that, it's your duty to yourself--and to me--and to people who can know how to, profit by your teaching and your example, not to give way as you're, doing, simply because a wornout old agnostic couldn't keep his hold on, the truth. I don't know what your Rixonitism is for if it won't let you, wait upon the divine will in such a thing, _too_. You're more, conscientious than the worst kind of Congregationalist. And now for you, to blame me\\\"--\\n\\nHe said, Oh, he should be so happy; and he gathered his dangling map, into the book and came over with me to where Mrs. March sat; and, like, the good young American husband I was in those days, I stood aside and, left the whole talk to her. She interested him so much more than I could, that I presently wandered away and amused myself elsewhere. When I came, back, she clutched my arm and bade me not speak a word; it was the most, romantic thing in the world, and she would tell me about it when we were, alone, but now I must go off again; he had just gone to get a book for, her which he had been speaking of, and would be back the next instant\\n\\nIt was not very reverent to his cloth, or his recent tragical mood, but, Glendenning was not offended; he laughed with a sheepish pleasure, and, that evening he came with Miss Bentley to call upon us. The visit passed, without unusual confidences until they rose to go, when she said, abruptly to me: \\\"I feel that we both owe you a great deal, Mr. March., Arthur has been telling me of your talk this afternoon, and I think that, what you said was all so wise and true! I don't mean,\\\" she added, \\\"your, suggestion about putting an end to the anomaly!\\\" and she and Glendenning, both laughed.\\n\\n\\\"It bound you from your first acknowledgment of it, and unless you could, deny your love now, or hereafter, it must always bind you. If you own, that you still love each other, you are still engaged, no matter how, much you release each other. Could you think of loving her and marrying, some one else? Could she love you and marry another? There isn't any, error, unless you've mistaken your feeling for each other. If you have\\n\\nHilbrook was a farmer, so far as he was anything industrially, and, Ewbert tried him with questions of crops, soils, and fertilizers; but he, tried him in vain. The old man said he had never cared much for those, things, and now it was too late for him to begin. He generally sold his, grass standing, and his apples on the trees; and he had no animals about, the place except his chickens,--they took care of themselves. Ewbert, urged, for the sake of conversation, even of a disputative character\\n\\nMy wife looked at me with a glance in which I saw tender affection, dangerously near contempt. \\\"You are a very forgiving man, Basil,\\\" she, said, and I looked down sheepishly. \\\"Well, at any rate, you have had the, sense not to mix yourself up in his business. Did he pretend that he, came straight to you, as soon as he got out? I suppose he wanted you to, believe that he appealed to you before he tried anybody else.\\\"\\n\\nand to bear and share with him. You see it was a great mistake not to, prepare the child for it sooner, and tell her just when Tedham would be, out, so that if she wanted to see him she could. She thinks she ought to, have been there at the prison waiting to speak to him the first one. I, thought it was a mistake to have her away, and I guess that's the way, Mrs. Hasketh looks at it herself, now.\\\"\",\n          \"Did I tell you that I had been to the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race?, But I have paragraphed it in the _Nation_, to which I refer you. It was, for about two minutes a supremely beautiful sight; but for those two, minutes I had to wait a horribly bleak hour and a half, shivering, in, mid-Thames, under the sour March-wind. I can't think of any other, adventures: save that I dined two or three days since at Mrs. Godfrey, Lushington's (they are very nice _blushing_ people) with a parcel of, quiet folk: but next to a divine little Miss Lushington (so pretty, English girls can be!) who told me that she lived in the depths of the, City, at Guy's Hospital, whereof her father is administrator. Guy's, Hospital--of which I have read in all old English novels. So does one, move all the while here on identified ground. This is the eve of Good, Friday, a most lugubrious day here--and all the world (save 4,000,000 or, so) are out of London for the ten days' Easter holiday.

Even if I could only find some manager or, publisher sufficiently devoted to believe in this and make me an, allowance for such a period, I would afterwards make a compact and sign, it with my blood, to reimburse him in thousands. But I shall not have to, come to this, or to depend upon it.\\n\\n, I return with much appreciation the vivid pages on Pater. They fill up, substantially the void of one's ignorance of his personal history, and, they are of a manner graceful and luminous; though I should perhaps, have relished a little more insistence on--a little more of an inside, view of--the nature of his mind itself. Much as they tell, however, how, curiously negative and faintly-grey he, after all telling, remains! I, think he has had--will have had--the most exquisite literary fortune:, i.e. to have taken it out all, wholly, exclusively, with the pen (the, style, the genius,) and absolutely not at all with the person. He is the, mask without the face, and there isn't in his total superficies a tiny, point of vantage for the newspaper to flap his wings on. You have been, lively about him--but about whom _wouldn't_ you be lively? I think you'd, be lively about _me_!--Well, faint, pale, embarrassed, exquisite Pater!, He reminds me, in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature, of, one of those lucent matchboxes which you place, on going to bed, near, the candle, to show you, in the darkness, where you can strike a light:, he shines in the uneasy gloom--vaguely, and has a phosphorescence, not a, flame. But I quite agree with you that he is not of the little day--but, of the longer time.\\n\\nI interrupted this a couple of hours since to go out and pay a visit to, Gustave Flaubert, it being his time of receiving, and his last Sunday in, Paris, and I owing him a farewell. _He_ is a very fine old fellow, and, the most interesting man and strongest artist of his circle. I had him, for an hour alone, and then came in his \\\"following,\\\" talking much of, Emile Zola's catastrophe--Zola having just had a serial novel for which, he was handsomely paid interrupted on account of protests from, provincial subscribers against its indecency. The opinion apparently was, that it was a bore, but that it could only do the book good on its, appearance in a volume. Among your tribulations as editor, I take it, that this particular one is not in store for you. On my way down from, Flaubert's I met poor Zola climbing the staircase, looking very pale and, sombre, and I saluted him with the flourish natural to a contributor who, has just been invited to make his novel last longer yet....\\n\\nThis will reach you about Xmas-time, and I imagine you reading it at a, window that looks out upon the snow-laden pines and hemlocks of Shady, Hill. That white winter light that is sent up into a room from the deep, snow is something that one quite loses the memory of here; and yet, as I, think of it now, it is associated in my mind with all kinds of pleasant, and comfortable indoor scenes. I am afraid that, for you, the season, will have no great animation; but you will, I suppose, see a good deal, of infantine exhilaration about you....\\n\\n, Nothing more delightful, or that has touched me more closely, even to, the spring of tears, has befallen me for years, literally, than to, receive your beautiful letter of Nov. 30th, so largely and liberally, anent _The W. of the D._ Every word of it goes to my heart and to, \\\"thank\\\" you for it seems a mere grimace. The same post brought me a, letter from dear John Hay, so that my measure has been full. I haven't, known anything about the American \\\"notices,\\\" heaven save the mark! any, more than about those here (which I am told, however, have been, remarkably genial;) so that I have _not_ had the sense of confrontation, with a public more than usually childish--I mean had it in any special, way. I confess, however, that that is my chronic sense--the more than, usual childishness of publics: and it is (has been,) in my mind, long, since discounted, and my work definitely insists upon being independent, of such phantasms and on unfolding itself wholly from its own \\\"innards.\\\", Of course, in our conditions, doing anything decent is pure, disinterested, unsupported, unrewarded heroism; but that's in the day's, work. The _faculty of attention_ has utterly vanished from the general, anglo-saxon mind, extinguished at its source by the big blatant, _Bayadere_ of Journalism, of the newspaper and the _picture_ (above all), magazine; who keeps screaming \\\"Look at _me_, _I_ am the thing, and I, only, the thing that will keep you in relation with me _all the time_, without your having to attend _one minute_ of the time.\\\" If you are, moved to write anything anywhere about the _W. of the D._ do say, something of that--it so awfully wants saying.

Illustrations\\n\\n, I think I should manifest an energy more becoming a child of yours if I, were to sustain my nodding head at least enough longer to scrawl the, initial words of my usual letter: we are travellers in the midst of, travel. You heard from me last at Innsbruck--or rather, I think, at, Botzen, just before, a place beautiful by nature but most ugly by man;, and [we] came by an admirable five hours' run through the remnant of the, Tyrol to Munich, where we spent two rather busy days. It's a singular, place and one difficult to write of with a serious countenance. It has a, fine lot of old pictures, but otherwise it is a nightmare of pretentious, vacuity: a city of chalky stucco--a Florence and Athens in canvas and, planks. To have come [thither] from Venice is a sensation! We found, reality at last at Nueremburg, by which place, combined with this, it, seemed a vast pity not to proceed rather than by stupid Stuttgart., Nueremburg is excellent--and comparisons are odious; but I would give a, thousand N.'s for one ray of Verona! We came on hither by a morning and, noon of railway, which has not in the least prevented a goodly afternoon, and evening at the Castle here. The castle (which I think you have all, seen in your own travels) is an incomparable ruin and holds its own, against any Italian memories. The light, the weather, the time, were, all, this evening, most propitious to our visit. This rapid week in, Germany has filled us with reflections and observations, tossed from, the railway windows on our course, and irrecoverable at this late hour., To me this hasty and most partial glimpse of Germany has been most, satisfactory; it has cleared from my mind the last mists of uncertainty, and assured me that I can never hope to become an unworthiest adoptive, grandchild of the fatherland. It is well to listen to the voice of the, spirit, to cease hair-splitting and treat one's self to a good square, antipathy--when it is so very sympathetic! I may 'cultivate' mine away\\n\\nHe had intended Lamb House to be a retreat from the pressure of the, world, but it need hardly be said that from the first it was thrown open, to his friends with hospitable freedom. In the matter of entertainment, his standard again was munificently high, and the consequences it, entailed were sometimes weightier than he found to his liking. But once, more it is necessary to read his laments over his violated hermitage, with many reserves. Lonely as he was in his work, he was not made for, any other kind of solitude; he needed companionship, and soon missed it, when it was withdrawn. After a few experiments he discovered that the, isolation of the winter at Rye by no means agreed with him; for the, short days and long evenings he preferred Pall Mall, where (after, letting his flat in Kensington) he engaged a permanent lodging at the, Reform Club. He could thus divide the year as he chose between London, and Rye, and the arrangement was so much to his liking that in five, years he made only one long absence from home. In 1899 he returned again, to Italy for the summer, paying a visit on the way to M. and Mme., Bourget at Hyeres. At Rome many associations were recalled for him by a, suggestion that he should write the life of William Wetmore Story, his, friend and host of twenty years before--a suggestion carried out, somewhat later in a book filled, as he said, with the old Roman, gold-dust of the seventies. He brought back new impressions also from a, visit to Mrs. Humphry Ward at Castel Gandolfo--where she and her family, were spending some weeks at the Villa Barberini, on the ridge between, the Roman Campagna and the Alban lake--and another to Marion Crawford at, Sorrento. He stayed briefly at Florence and Venice, and returned home to, find a special reason awaiting him for renewed application to work. He, had taken Lamb House on a lease, but the death of its owner now made it, necessary to decide whether he should purchase it outright. He paid the, price without hesitation; he was by this time deeply attached to the, place and he seized the chance of making it his own. The earnings of his, work would not go far towards paying for it, but he felt it all the more, urgent to concentrate upon production for some time to come. He did not, leave England again till four years later, nor his own roof for more, than a few days now and then.\\n\\nThe second Henry James has left so full and vivid a portrait of his, father that it is unnecessary to dwell on the happy influences under, which the family passed their youth. The 'ideas' of the head of the, house, as his remote speculations were familiarly known at home, lay, outside the range of his second son; but in the preface to a collection, of papers, posthumously issued in 1884, they are sympathetically, expounded and appraised by William James, whose adventurous mind\\n\\nwhen he was still working upon the book, \\\" ...and to understand the, English character, or at least the mind, as well as if I had invented, it--which indeed,\\\" he adds lightly, \\\"I think I could have done without, any very extraordinary expenditure of ingenuity.\\\" The end of the summer, of 1888 was spent in an hotel at Torquay, which became one of his, favourite retreats; and later in the autumn he was for a short while, abroad, at Geneva and Paris, with a flying dip into Northern Italy. The, letter to his brother, written from Geneva, with which this section, closes, lucidly sums up the conclusions he had by now drawn from the, experience of a dozen years of England. At the age of forty-five he, could feel that he had exhausted the study of the old international, distinctions, English and American, that had engaged him for so long. He, was indeed to return to them again, later on, and to devote to them the, final elaboration of his art; but that lay far ahead, and now for many, years he faced in other directions.\\n\\npersonally, his books, and this last re-placement of himself so _en, scene_ (so largely by his own aid, too) has _killed_ the literary, baggage. Out of no mystery now do they issue, the creations in, question--and they couldn't afford to lose it. Louis himself never, understood that; he too publicly caressed and accounted for them--but I, needn't insist on what I mean. As I _see_ it, at all events, it's a, strange little evolution and all taking place here, quite compactly\\n\\nHis recollections of childhood began, surprisingly enough, when he was, little more than a year old. In the summer of 1844 the parents carried, their two infants, William and Henry, for a visit to Europe, an, adventure not altogether lost upon the younger; for he actually retained, an impression of Paris, a glimpse of the Place Vendome, to be the, foundation of all his European experience. His earliest American, memories were of Albany; but the family were soon established in, Fourteenth Street, New York, which was their home for some ten years, a, settlement only broken by family visits and summer weeks by the sea. The, children's extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous education went, forward under various teachers, their father's erratic rule having, apparently but one principle, that they should stay nowhere long enough, to receive any formal imprint. To Henry at least their schooling meant, nothing whatever but the opportunity of conducting his own education in, his own way, and he made the utmost of the easy freedom they enjoyed. He, was able to stare and brood to his heart's content, and thus to feed his, imagination on the only pasturage it required.\\n\\nis rather amusing--as amusing as anything can be, for a man of taste and, sensibility, in the odious process of practical dramatic production. I, may have been meant for the Drama--God knows!--but I certainly wasn't, meant for the Theatre. C'est pour vous dire that I am much pressed and, am only sending you mes voeux tres-sinceres in a shabbily brief little, letter. There are a number of interesting things in your last to which I, want to respond. I send you also by post 3 or 4 miserable little (old), views of Tunbridge Wells, which I have picked up in looking, at rare, leisure moments, for one good one for you. I haven't, alas, found that;, but I think I am on the track of it, and you shall have it as soon as it, turns up. Accept these meanwhile as a little stop-gap and a symbol of my, New Year's greeting.... I hope you are in good case and good hope. We, are having here an excellent winter, almost fogless and generally, creditable. Write me a little word of hope and help for the 5th; I shall, regard it as a happy influence for yours forever\\n\\nI brood with mingled elation and depression on your ingenious, your, really inspired, suggestion that I shall give you a ghost, and that my, ghost shall be \\\"international.\\\" I say inspired because, singularly, enough, I set to work some months ago at an international ghost, and on, just this scale, 50,000 words; entertaining for a little the highest, hopes of him. He was to have been wonderful and beautiful; he was to, have been called (perhaps too metaphysically) \\\"The Sense of the Past\\\";, and he was to have been supplied to a certain Mr ---- who was then, approaching me--had then approached me.... The outstretched arm\\n\\n, I send you by this post the sheets of that little tribute to your genius, which I spoke of to you so many months ago and which appears in the, _Century_ for May. The magazine is not yet out, or I would send you, that, and the long delay makes my article so slight in itself, rather, an impotent conclusion. Let me hasten to assure you that the \\\"London, Society\\\", tacked to the title, is none of my doing, but that of the, editors of the Magazine, who put in an urgent plea for it. Such as my, poor remarks are, I hope you will find in them nothing disagreeable, but, only the expression of an exceeding friendliness. May my blessing go, with them and a multitude of good wishes!\\n\\nhave held up our head. It had been long, before that, since any decent, sentence was turned in English. We grow systematically vulgarer and, baser. The only blur of light is that your books are tasted. I shall try, to see Colvin before I post this--otherwise I haven't seen him for three, months. I've had a summer of the British seaside, the bathing machine, and the German band. I met Zola at luncheon the day before he left, London and found him very sane and common and inexperienced. Nothing\\n\\nas I have \\\"fixed\\\" it, a more truly curious and interesting, drama--especially a more human one. _But_, as I say, there are the, necessities of space, as to which I have a dread of deluding myself only, to find that by trying to blink them I shall be grossly \\\"sold,\\\" or by, giving way to them shall positively spoil my form for your purpose. The, hitch is that the thing involves a devil of a sort of prologue or, preliminary action--interesting itself and indispensable for, lucidity--which impinges too considerably (for brevity) on the core of, the subject. My one chance is yet, I admit, to try to attack the same, (the subject) from still another quarter, at still another angle, that I, make out as a possible one and which may keep it squeezable and short., If this experiment fails, I fear I shall have to \\\"chuck\\\" the, supernatural and the high fantastic. I have just finished, as it, happens, a fine flight (of eighty thousand words) _into_ the high, fantastic, which has rather depleted me, or at any rate affected me as, discharging my obligations in that quarter. But I believe I mentioned to, you in my last \\\"The Sacred Fount\\\"--this has been \\\"sold\\\" to Methuen here\\n\\nand these bushy ornaments had the effect of making him in a sense,      shadowy. Almost every afternoon he took a walk with me, rarely with,      Sargent, never with the sedentary rest; these walks were long in,      time but not in distance, for Henry was inclined to saunter. He had,      not wholly recovered from that weakness of the muscles of his back,      which had so long troubled him, and I suppose that this was the,      cause of a curious stiffness in his progress, which proceeded,      rather slowly. He had certain preferences, in particular for the,      level road through the green landscape to the ancient grey village,      of Aston Somerville. He always made the same remark, as if he had,      never noticed it before, that Aston was \\\"so Italian, so Tuscan.\\\"\\n\\n, I have, as usual, endless unacknowledged benefits to thank you for after, too many days. The last is your letter of the end of March, full of, interesting substance as always and of things that no one else has the, imagination or the inspiration to tell me. (My allusion to the, imagination there is not, believe me, an imputation on your exactitude., The light of truth, of good solid vivid Boston truth, shines in each of, your pages.) Especially are you interesting and welcome, as I have told, you before, I think, on the young generations and full-blown, though, new, existences, that are in possession of a scene I knew as otherwise, occupied. All the old names--or most of them--appear to be represented, by the remote posterity of my old acquaintance. In this remote, posterity, however, I take an interest--and scraps and specimens of it\\n\\nat all; I mean as to the general complexity of life. His _Ballad_ future, may still be big. But my view of his prose future has much shrunken in, the light of one's increasingly observing how little of life he can make, use of. Almost nothing civilised save steam and patriotism--and the, latter only in verse, where I _hate_ it so, especially mixed up with, God and goodness, that that half spoils my enjoyment of his great, talent. Almost nothing of the complicated soul or of the female form or, of any question of _shades_--which latter constitute, to my sense, the, real formative literary discipline. In his earliest time I thought he, perhaps contained the seeds of an English Balzac; but I have quite given, that up in proportion as he has come steadily from the less simple in, subject to the more simple--from the Anglo-Indians to the natives, from, the natives to the Tommies, from the Tommies to the quadrupeds, from the, quadrupeds to the fish, and from the fish to the engines and screws....\\n\\nhowever, which I endeavour more and more to keep, if possible, within, the compass of _hours_. The gilded bondage of the country house becomes, onerous as one grows older, and then the waste of time in vain sitting, and strolling about is a gruesome thought in the face of what one still, wants to do with one's remnant of existence. I saw Matt Arnold the other, night, and he spoke very genially of you and of his visit to, Ashfield--very _affectionately_, too, of George Curtis--which I loudly, echoed. M. A. said of Stockbridge and the summer life thereabouts, etc., (with his chin in the air)--\\\"Yes, yes--it's a proof that it's attaching, that one thinks of it again--one thinks of it again.\\\" This was amiably, sublime and amiably characteristic.--I see Burne-Jones from time to, time, but not as often as I should like. I am always so afraid of, breaking in on his work. Whenever he is at home he is working and when, he isn't working he's not at home. When I _do_ see him, it is one of the, best human pleasures that London has for me. But I don't understand his, life--that is the manner and tenor of his production--a complete, _studio_ existence, with doors and windows closed, and no search for, impressions outside--no open air, no real daylight and no looking out, for it. The things he does in these conditions have exceeding, beauty--but they seem to me to grow colder and colder--pictured, abstractions, less and less observed. Such as he is, however, he is, certainly the most distinguished artistic figure among Englishmen, to-day--the only one who has escaped vulgarization and on whom claptrap, has no hold. Moreover he is, as you know, exquisite in mind and, talk--and we fraternize greatly....\\n\\nwhich fortunately shines, and giving myself up to the sweet sense of, living once more--after an interval of several years--in the adorable, country it illumines. It is Sunday and all the world is in the streets, and squares, and the Italian type greets me in all its handsomeness and, friendliness, and also, I fear I must add, not a little in its, vulgarity. But its vulgarity is the exaggeration of a merit and not, as, in England and the U.S., of a defect. Churches and galleries have such a, fatal chill that being sore-throatish and neuralgic I have had to keep, out of them, but the Duomo lifts all its pinnacles and statues into the, far away light, and looks across at the other white needles and spires, of the Alps in the same bewildering cluster. I go to spend the remainder, of this month in Florence and afterwards to--I hope--take a month, between Rome, Naples and Venice--but it will be as it will turn out., Once I am in Italy it is about the same to me to be in one place as in, another.\\n\\nI suppose, with the genial Bob! May you be floated grandly over your, cataract--by which I don't mean have any manner of fall, but only be a, Niagara of eloquence, all continuously, whether above or below the, rapids. You will send me, I devoutly hope, some report of the whole, thing. It affects me much even at this distance and in this so grossly, alien air--this overt dedication of dear old Emerson to his immortality., I hope all the attendant circumstances will be graceful and beautiful. I, came back hither as I believe I have mentioned, some six days ago, after, some 18 weeks in London, which went, this time, very well, and were very, easy, on my present extremely convenient basis, to manage. The Spring, here, till within a week, has been backward and blighted; but Summer has, arrived at last with a beautiful jump, and Rye is quite adorable in its, outbreak of greenery and blossom. I never saw it more lovely than, yesterday, a supreme summer (early summer) Sunday. The dear little charm, of the place at such times consoles me for the sordid vandalisms that, are rapidly disfiguring and that I fear will soon quite destroy it., Another scare for me just now is the threatened destruction of the two, little charmingly-antique silver-grey cottages on the right of the, little vista that stretches from my door to the church--the two that you, may remember just beyond my garden wall, and in one of which my gardener, has lately been living. They will be replaced, if destroyed, by a pair, of hideous cheap modern workingman's cottages--a horrid inhuman stab at, the very heart of old Rye. There is a chance it may be still, averted--but only just a bare chance. One would buy them, in a moment\\n\\nalways, as through a company of ghosts, so completely have sound and, sight of individuals and presences faded away from me. Still, I _have_, had some close reminders. Wendell Holmes was here, still beautiful and, charming, for a day or two, and above all, off and on, for a couple of, months my nephew Harry, whom you well know, and in whom I took no end of, comfort and pleasure. His being here was a great satisfaction to me--and, doubled by the fact of my so getting more news of William and Alice than, I have had for many a year. She sent to the boy all his father's letters, from California and elsewhere--the consequence of which, for me, was a, wonderful participation and interest. William appears to have had a, magnificent sort of summer and no end of success on the Pacific, slope--besides innumerable impressions by the way and an excellent, series of weeks in the Adirondacks before going forth. But after all\\n\\n, It's a great pleasure to hear from you in this far country--though I, greatly wish it weren't from the bed of anguish--or at any rate of, delicacy: if delicacy may be connected, that is, with anything so, indelicate as a bed! But I'm very glad to gather that it's the couch of, convalescence. Only, if you have a Back, for heaven's sake take care of, it. When I was about your age--in 1862!--I did a bad damage (by a strain, subsequently--through crazy juvenility--neglected) to mine; the, consequence of which is that, in spite of retarded attention, and years\\n\\n1895, with George Alexander and Miss Marion Terry in the chief parts., The story of this unfortunate venture is to be read in the letters that, follow. The play (which has never been published) was enthusiastically, received by the few and roughly rejected by the many; it ran for exactly, a month and then disappeared for good. It was the most ambitious, and no, doubt the best, piece of dramatic work that Henry James had produced\\n\\nI lately spent a number of months in America, after a long absence, but, I live in London and have put my constant address at the top of my, letter. I imagine that it is scarcely ever in your power to come to, England, but do take note of my whereabouts, for this happy (and, possibly, to you, ideal) contingency. I should very much like to see, you--but I go little, nowadays, to Switzerland in summer (though at one, time I was there a good deal). I think it possible moreover that at that, season you get out of your Alps. I certainly should, in your place, for, the Alps are easily too many for me.--I can well imagine the innumerable, things you miss at Davos--year after year--and (I will say it) I think, of you with exceeding sympathy. As a sign of that I shall send you, everything I publish.\\n\\nthough it developed on quite other lines. It is natural to speak of the, father as a Swedenborgian, for the writings of Swedenborg had been the, chief source of his inspiration and supplied the tincture of his, thought. He did not, however, himself admit this description of his, point of view, which indeed was original and unconventional to the last, degree. It was directed towards an ideal, to use William James's words\\n\\nDrama--tableau! My dear Tony, you are literally my saviour. The above, row of stars represents midnight emotions and palpitations of no mean, order. As I finished the line just before the stars I became aware that, a smell of smoke, a sense of burning that had worried me for the, previous hour, had suddenly very much increased and that the room was, full of it. _De fil en aiguille_, and in much anxiety, I presently, discovered that the said smoke was coming up through the floor between, the painted dark-green planks (_dark_ green!) of the margin--outside of, matting and rugs, and under a table near the fireplace. To assure myself, that there was no source of flame in the room below, and then to go up, and call my servant, do you see? (he long since snoring in bed--for it's, now 2.15 a.m.) was the work of a moment. With such tools as we could, command we hacked and pried and sawed and tore up a couple of, planks--from which volumes of smoke issued!! Do you see the midnight, little flurry? Bref, we got _at_ it--a charred\\n\\nagainst many, many long years of London, which has ended by giving me a, deep sense of the quantity of \\\"cry\\\" in all that life compared to the, almost total absence of \\\"wool.\\\" By which I mean, simply, that, acquaintances and relations there have a way of seeming at last to end, in smoke--while having consumed a great deal of fuel and taken a great, deal of time. I dare say I shall some day re-establish the balance, and, I have kept my habitation there, though I let it whenever I can; but at, present I am as conscious of the advantage of the Sussex winter as of, that of the Sussex summer. But I've just returned from three days in, London, mainly taken up with seeing my brother William as to whom your, letter contained an anxious inquiry to which I ought before this to have, done justice. The difficulty has been, these three months, that he has, been working, with the most approved medical and \\\"special\\\" aid, for a, change of condition, which one hoped would have been apparent by now--so, that one might have good news to give. I am sorry to say the change, remains, as yet, but imperfectly apparent--though I dare say it has\\n\\nto my infinite chagrin. I should have seen it well from my balcony, as I, should have been at home when it passed, and it smashed the windows in, the houses (three doors from mine) on the corner of Bolton St. and, Piccadilly. Alice was all unconscious of it till the morrow, and was, not at all agitated. The wreck and ruin in Piccadilly and some other, places (I mean of windows) was, on my return from Bournemouth\\n\\n, I respond with joy to your suggestion in your beautiful letter of two, days ago--that I shall enable you to find a word from me on your table, on the darkest a. m. of the year; in the first place because I am much, touched by your attaching to any word of mine any power to comfort or, charm; and in the second because I can well measure--by my own--your, sense of a melancholy from which you must appeal. It is indeed a, lugubrious feast and a miserable merriment. But it is something to spend, the evil season by one's own poor hearthstone (save that yours is, opulent), crouching over the embers and chuckling low over all the, dreadful places where one is not! I've been literally pressed to go to, two or three--one of them in Northumberland! (the cheek of some people!), and the reflection that I _might_ be there and yet by heaven's mercy am, not, does give a faint blush as of the rose to my otherwise deep, depression. It is a mild, gray, rainless, sunless inoffensive sort of, Xmas here--and the shop fronts look rather prettily pink and green and, golden in the dear dirty old London streets--and I have ventured into, three or four--but _I_ do it, bless you, for nine and sevenpence, half-penny, all told! No wonder you want epistolary balm if you're, already in the fifties! Do you give them diamond necklaces and Arab, horses all round?--But Torquay, I too intensely felt, has gorgeous ways, of its own. Really it isn't bad here, for almost every one has left, town. I have yet had nothing worse to suffer than a first night at the, Lyceum--the too great Irvingism of which--mainly in Ellen Terry's, box--had been, the same day, pleasantly mitigated, in advance, by Tessa, Gosse in Sheridan's _Critic_. Tessa had a play and acted Mr Puff better, than any of her blushing fellow-nymphs acted anything else. And on New, Year's eve I go to her parents for a carouse of some sort, and until, then, thank God! I don't dine out save on Xmas day. Nor in 1897--by all, that's holy! _ever_ again! I have been quite smothered with it these two, months--and it's getting far beyond a joke.... I see no literary fry\\n\\nmoreover, your three glorious volumes of illustrated prose have arrived, to enrich my existence, adorn my house and inflame my expectations. With, many things pressing upon me at this moment as preliminary to winding-up, here and betaking myself, till early in the summer, to London, my more, penetrative attention has not yet been free for them; but I am gathering, for the swoop. Please meanwhile be tenderly thanked for the massive and, magnificent character of the gift. What a glorious quantity of work it, brings home to me that you do! I feel like a hurdy-gurdy man listening, outside a cathedral to the volume of sound poured forth there by the, enthroned organist.... But good-night, my dear Howells, with every, feebly-breathed, but forcibly-felt good wish of yours always and ever\\n\\nAnd also I applaud, dearest Howard, your expression of attachment to him, who holds this pen (and passes it at this moment over very dirty paper:), for he is extremely accessible to such demonstrations and touched by, them--more than ever in his lonely (more than) maturity. Keep it up as, hard as possible; continue to pass your hand into my arm and believe, that I always like greatly to feel it. We are two who can communicate, freely.\\n\\ntwinkling and twittering, with a semi-foreign light, a kind of familiar, _wink_ in the air, would have favoured your health, your spirits, and, heaven knows your being here would have favoured mine. I breakfast all, these weeks, mostly, with my window open to the garden and a flood of, sunshine pouring in. It's really meridional. It would--Rye would--remind, you of Granada--more or less. But I hope, after Xmas, to be in town for, three or four months. You will surely pass and repass there. When I, at, intervals, go up, on some practical urgency, for three or four hours, I, always see the abysmal Jon. He usually has some news of you to give; and, when he hasn't it's not for want of--on my part--solemn invocation., However, I must now solemnly invoke slumber. Good-night--good-morning. I, bless your house, its glorious mistress and its innocent heir.\\n\\n, ...I wish you could take a good holiday and spend it in these countries., I have got to feel like such an old European that I could almost pretend, to help to do you the honours. I am at least now a thoroughly, naturalised Londoner--a cockney \\\"convaincu.\\\" I am attached to London in, spite of the long list of reasons why I should not be; I think it on the, whole the best point of view in the world. There are times when the fog\\n\\n, You _shall_ have a letter this morning, whatever happens! I am waiting, for the train to Carcassonne, and you will perhaps ask yourself why you, are thus sandwiched between these two mouldy antiquities. It is, precisely because they are mouldy that I invoke your genial presence., Toulouse is dreary and not interesting, and I am afraid that Carcassonne, will answer to the same description I heard given a couple of weeks ago, by an English lady in Touraine, of the charming Chateau d'Amboise:, \\\"rather curious, you know, but very, very dirty.\\\" Therefore my spirit, turns for comfort to what I have known best in life. I got your last, excellent letter an abominable number of weeks ago; and I hereby, propose, as a rule of our future correspondence, that I be graciously, absolved from ever specifying the time that has elapsed since the, arrival of the letter I am supposed to be answering. This custom will, ease me off immensely. Your last, however, is not so remote but that the, scolding you gave me for sending your previous letter to Mrs. Kemble is, fearfully fresh in my mind. My dear Grace, I regret extremely having, irritated you; but I would fain wrestle with you on this subject. I, think you have a false code about the showing of letters--and in calling, it a breach of confidence you surely confound the limits of things. Of, course there is always a particular discretion for the particular case;, but what are letters but talk, and what is the showing them but the, repetition of talk? The same rules that govern that of course govern the, other; but I don't see why they should be more stringent. It is indeed\\n\\nit all passes over me like an old-time song. You see how much I need you, close at hand to stand successfully on the tiptoe of emulation. You, fatigue, in short, my credulity, though not my affection. We lately, clubbed together, all, to despatch to you an eye-witness in the person, of the genius or the _genus_, in himself, Rudyard, for the concussion of, whose extraordinary personality with your own we are beginning soon to, strain the listening ear. We devoutly hope that this time he will really, be washed upon your shore. With him goes a new little wife--whose, brother--Wolcott Balestier, lately dead, in much youthful promise and, performance (I don't allude, in saying that, especially to the literary, part of it,) was a very valued young friend of mine.... The main thing, that has lately happened to myself is the death of my dear sister a, fortnight ago--after years of suffering, which, however, had not made, her any less rare and remarkable a person or diminished the effect of, the event (when it should occur) in making an extreme difference in my, life. Of my occupation what shall I tell you? I have of late years left, London less and less--but I am thinking sooner or later (in a near, present) of making a long foreign, though not distant, absence. I am, busy with the _short_--I have forsworn the long. I hammer at the horrid, little theatrical problem, with delays and intermissions, but, horrible, to relate, no failure of purpose. I shall soon publish another small, story-book which I will incontinently send you. I have done many brief, fictions within the last year.... The good little Thomas Hardy has, scored a great success with _Tess of the d'Urbervilles_, which is, chock-full of faults and falsity and yet has a singular beauty and, charm....\\n\\nHe spent the summer of 1892 again in Italy, avoiding the tourist-stream, by settling at Siena, after it had subsided, in the company of M. and, Mme. Paul Bourget, by this time his intimate friends. William James and, his family were now in Europe for a year of Switzerland and Italy, and, Henry joined them at Lausanne on his way home. The next two years of, London were given up, almost without intermission, to the hopes and, anxieties of his theatrical affairs, in which he was now completely, immersed--so much so, indeed, as to test his very remarkable powers of, physical endurance, which seem in middle life to have thrown off the, early troubles of his health. When this time of fevered agitation was, over he was able to compose himself at once to happier work, without, apparently feeling even the need of a day's holiday. In 1893 he was in, Paris in the spring, and again for a short while in Switzerland with his, brother; but these excursions were never real holidays--he was quickly, uneasy if he had not work of some kind on hand. He projected another, summer in Italy for the following year, and spent it chiefly in Venice, and Rome. This was the last of Italy, however, for some time; there were, too many friends everywhere--\\\"the most disastrous attempt I have ever, made,\\\" he writes, \\\"to come abroad for privacy and quiet.\\\" Still the only, alternative seemed to be sea-side lodgings in England; and for the, summer of 1895, escaping from the London season as usual, he went to, Torquay. By this time Guy Domville had failed and he was free again; he, had the happiest winter of work in London that he had known for five, years. After finishing some short stories he began The Spoils of, Poynton, and with it the series of his works that belong definitely to, his \\\"later manner.\\\" At last, in 1896, instead of his usual esplanade\\n\\nhe was faithful throughout to a few yards of town-pavement, not because, he was scared by the rough freedom of the wild, but rather because he, was impatient of its insipidity. He is very often to be heard crying out, against the tyrannous claims of his world, when they interfere with his, work, his leisure, his health; but at the moment of greatest revulsion, he never suggests that the claims may be fraudulent after all, or that, this small corner of modernity is not the best and most fruitful that, the age has to shew.\\n\\nwas never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they, fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense, eloquence in her passionate \\\"radicalism\\\"--her most distinguishing, feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like, everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or, example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a, feminine \\\"political force.\\\" But had she lived in the world and seen, things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However\\n\\nand I lick my chops in advance. It is very delectable, I can see, and it, has the prettiest coat and face of any of your volumes.--London is, settling to its winter pace, and the cool rich fogs curtain us in. I see, Colvin once in a while _dans le monde_, which however I frequent less, and less. I miss you too sensibly. My love to your wife and mother--my, greeting to the brave Lloyd.\\n\\nCambridge and Boston society still rejoices in that imposing fixedness, of outline which is ever so inspiring to contemplate. In Cambridge I see, Arthur Sedgwick and Howells; but little of any one else. Arthur seems, not perhaps an enthusiastic, but a well-occupied man, and talks much in, a wholesome way of meaning to go abroad. Howells edits, and observes and, produces--the latter in his own particular line with more and more, perfection. His recent sketches in the _Atlantic_, collected into a, volume, belong, I think, by the wondrous cunning of their manner, to, very good literature. He seems to have resolved himself, however, [into], one who can write solely of what his fleshly eyes have seen; and for, this reason I wish he were \\\"located\\\" where they would rest upon richer, and fairer things than this immediate landscape. Looking about for, myself, I conclude that the face of nature and civilization in this our, country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it, will yield its secrets only to a really _grasping_ imagination. This I, think Howells lacks. (Of course _I_ don't!) To write well and worthily, of American things one need even more than elsewhere to be a _master_., But unfortunately one is less!... I myself have been scribbling some, little tales which in the course of time you will have a chance to read., To write a series of good little tales I deem ample work for a, life-time. I dream that my life-time shall have done it. It's at least a, relief to have arranged one's life-time....\\n\\never and always, to hear from you. You say that had you not been writing, me the particular thing you were, you fear you wouldn't have been, writing at all; but it is a compliment I can better. I really believe, that if I weren't writing you this, on my side, I _should_ be writing, you something else. For I've been, of late, reading you again as, continuously as possible--the worst I mean by which is as continuously, as the book-sellers consent: and the result of \\\"Ragged Lady,\\\" the, \\\"Silver Journey,\\\" the \\\"Pursuit of the Piano\\\" and two or three other, things (none wrested from your inexorable hand, but paid for from scant, earnings) has been, ever so many times over, an impulse of reaction, of, an intensely cordial sort, directly _at_ you--all, alas, spending, itself, for sad and sore want of you, in the heavy air of this alien, clime and the solitude, here, of my unlettered life. I wrote to you to, Kittery Point--I think it was--something like a year ago, and my chief, occupation since then has been listening for the postman's knock. But, let me quickly add that I understand overwhelmingly well what you say of, the impossibility for you, at this time of day, of letters. God knows, they _are_ impossible--the great fatal, incurable, unpumpable leak of, one's poor sinking bark. Non ragioniam di lor--I understand all about, it; and it only adds to the pleasure with which, even on its personal, side, I greet your present communication.\\n\\n, My failure, during these few days, to thank you for everything has not, come from a want of appreciation of _anything_--or from a want of, gratitude, or lively remembrance, or fond hope; or, in short, from, anything but a quite calculating and canny view that I shall perhaps, come in, during your present episode, with a slightly greater effect of, direct support and encouragement than if I had come during the fever of, your late short interval in London. It seems to be \\\"borne in\\\" to me that, you may be feeling--la ou vous etes--a little lone and lorn, a little, alien and exotic; so that the voice of the compatriot, counsellor and, moderator, may fall upon your ears with an approach to sweetness. I am, sure, all the same, that you are in a situation of great and refreshing, novelty and of general picturesque interest. At your leisure you will, give me news of it, and I wish you meanwhile, as the best advice, to, drain it to the dregs and leave no element of it untasted.\\n\\nI ordered my year-old \\\"Maisie\\\" the other day to be sent to you, and I, trust she will by this time have safely arrived--in spite of some, ambiguity in the literation of the name of your villa as, with your, letter in my hand, I earnestly meditate upon it. I have also despatched, to Madame Paul myself a little volume just published--a poor little, pot-boiling study of nothing at all, qui ne tire pas a consequence. It, is but a monument to my fatal technical passion, which prevents my ever, giving up anything I have begun. So that when something that I have, supposed to be a subject turns out on trial really to be none, je m'y, acharne d'autant plus, for mere superstition--superstitious fear, I, mean, of the consequences and omens of weakness. The small book in, question is really but an exercise in the art of not appearing to one's, self to fail. You will say it is rather cruel that for such exercises, the public also should have to pay. Well, Madame Paul and you get your, exemplaire for nothing.\\n\\nwonderful aesthetic hair. From San Remo I came along the rest of the, coast to Genoa, _not_ by carriage however, as I might have done, for I, was rather afraid of three days \\\"on end\\\" of my own society: that is, not, on end, but sitting down. When I am tired of myself in common situations, I can get up and walk away; so, in a word, I came in the train, and the, train came in a tunnel--for it was almost all one--for five or six, hours. I have been going to Venice--but it is so cold and blustering, that I think to-morrow, when I depart from this place, the idea of, reaching the southernmost point will get the better of me, and I shall, make straight for Rome. I will write you from there--where I first, beheld you: that is, familiarity (if I may be allowed the expression)., Enough meanwhile about myself, my intentions and delays: let me hear, or, at least let me ask, about your own circumstances and propensities...., You must have felt _spattered_, like all the world, with the blood of, the poor Russian Czar! Aren't you glad you are not an Empress? But you, are. God save your Majesty!--Mrs. Greville sent me Swinburne's, complicated dirge upon her poor simple mother, and I thought it wanting, in all the qualities that one liked in Mrs T. I should like very much to, send a tender message to Mrs Gordon: indefinite--but _very_ tender! To, you I am both tender and definite (save when I cross).\\n\\nand feeling very easy and even jolly about her Leamington winter. My, being away is a sign of her really good symptoms. She was _wuethend_, after the London police, in connection with the Whitechapel murders, to, a degree that almost constituted robust health. I have seen a great many, (that is, more than usual) Frenchmen in London this year: they bring me, notes of introduction--and the other day, the night before coming away\\n\\nBy the time this reaches you I suppose your wife and children will have, gone to recline under the greenwood tree. I hope their gentle outlawry, will be full of comfort for them. It's poor work to me writing about, them without ever seeing them. But my interest in them is deep and, large, and please never omit to give my great love to them: to Alice, first in the lump, to be broken up and distributed by her. May you, squeeze with a whole skin through the tight weeks of the last of the, term--may you live to rest and may you rest to live. I shall not, I, think, soon again write to you so rarely as for the last year. This will, be partly because _The Tragic Muse_ is to be my last long novel. For the, rest of my life I hope to do lots of short things with irresponsible, spaces between. I see even a great future (ten years) of such. But they, won't make money. Excuse (you probably rather will esteem) the sordid, tone of your affectionate\\n\\n, I have delayed too long to thank you for your genial last: which please, attribute to the misery of my Boulevard-baffled aspirations. Paris n'est, plus possible--from any point of view--and I leave it tomorrow or next, day, when my address will become: _Hotel National, Lucerne_. I join my, brother there for a short time. This place continues to _rengorger_ with, sunshine and sauces, not to mention other appeals to the senses and, pitfalls to the pocket. I am not alluding in particular to the Queen of, Golconda! I have read _Matelot_ more or less over again; for the extreme, penury of the _idea_ in Loti, and the almost puerile thinness of this, particular donnee, wean me not a jot from the irresistible charm the, rascal's very limitations have for me. I drink him down as he _is_--like, a philtre or a _baiser_, and the coloration of his _moindre mots_ has a, peculiar magic for me. Read _aloud_ to yourself the passage ending, section XXXV--the upper part of page 165, and perhaps you will find in, it something of the same strange _eloquence_ of suggestion and rhythm as, I do: which is what literature gives when it is most exquisite and which, constitutes its sovereign value and its resistance to devouring time., And yet what _niaiseries_! Paris continues gorgeous and rainless, but, less torrid. I have become inured to fear as careless of penalties., There are no new books but old papiers de famille et d'arriere-boutique, dished up. Poor Harland came and spent 2 or 3 hours with me the other, afternoon--at a cafe-front and on chairs in the Champs-Elysees. He, looked better than the time previous, but not well; and I am afraid, things are not too well _with_ him. One would like to help him--and I, try to--in talk; but he is not too helpable, for there is a chasm too, deep to bridge, I fear, in the pitfall of his literary longings, unaccompanied by the _faculty_. Apropos of such things I am very glad to, see _your_ faculty is reflowering. I shall return to England for the, volume. Are you writing about Symonds? Vale--especially in the manual, part. And valeat your _dame compagne_.\\n\\nhowever, terribly little doubt that, practically, for those who have, been happy in Europe even Cambridge the Brilliant is not an easy place, to live in. When I saw you in London, plunged up to your necks in that, full, rich, abundant, various London life, I knew that a day of, reckoning was coming and I heaved a secret prophetic sigh. I can well, understand Charles's saying that the memory of these and kindred things, is a perpetual private [? pang]. But pity our poor bare country and, don't revile. England and Italy, with their countless helps to life and, pleasure, are the lands for happiness and self-oblivion. It would seem, that in our great unendowed, unfurnished, unentertained and, unentertaining continent, where we all sit sniffing, as it were, the, very earth of our foundations, we ought to have leisure to turn out, something handsome from the very heart of simple human nature. But after, I have been at home a couple of months I will tell you what I think., Meanwhile I aspire to linger on here in Italy and make the most of, it--even in poor little overshadowed Florence and in a society limited, to waiters and washerwomen. In your letter of last summer you amiably, reproach me with not giving you personal tidings, and warn me in my, letters against mistaking you for the _Nation_. Heaven forbid! But I, have no _nouvelles intimes_ and in this solitary way of life I don't, ever feel especially like a person. I write more or less in the, mornings, walk about in the afternoons, and doze over a book in the, evenings. You can do as well as that in Cambridge....\\n\\n, I have been very sorry to hear from you of renewed upsets on quitting, these walls--the same fate having, I remember, overtaken you most of the, other times you've been here. I trust it isn't the infection of the, walls themselves, nor of the _re_fection (so scant last time) enjoyed, within them. Is it some baleful effluence of your host? He will try and, exercise next time some potent counter-charm--and meanwhile he rejoices, that your devil is cast out.\\n\\nfor the autumn. It was here that he began his intimacy with J. R., Lowell, in afternoon walks with him between mornings of work and, evenings at the Theatre Francais. He declares that he saw no one else in, Paris--his mind was firmly set upon Italy. To Rome he went for the first, six months of 1873, where he was now at home enough among ancient, solitudes to have time and thought for social novelty. Thirty years, later, in his life of William Wetmore Story, he revived the American, world of what was still a barely modernised Rome, the world into which, he was plunged by acquaintance with the sculptor and his circle. Now and, thenceforward it was not so much the matter for sketches of travel that, he was collecting as it was the matter for the greater part of his, best-known fiction. The American in Europe was to be his own subject\\n\\n, J'aurais du deja vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait, en m'envoyant _Sapho_. Je vous suis tres-reconnaissant de cette bonne et, amicale pensee, qui s'ajoutera desormais, pour moi, au souvenir du, livre. Je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivee de votre volume pour le, lire--mais cela m'a donne l'occasion de m'y remettre encore et de tirer, un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages, m'ont laissees. Je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions, dans leur plenitude--dans la crainte de ne reussir qu'a deformer ma, pensee--tout autant que la votre. Un nouveau livre de vous me fait, passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idees, que je vous confierais de, vive voix--et de grand coeur--si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus, souvent. Pour le moment, je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient, de vous compte, pour moi, comme un grand evenement, une jouissance rare, et fructueuse. Je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans, d'autres, mais vous me charmez, vous m'enlevez toujours, et votre, maniere me penetre plus qu'aucune autre. Je trouve dans _Sapho_, enormement de verite et de vie. Ce n'est pas du roman, c'est de, l'histoire, et de la plus complete et de la mieux eclairee. Lorsqu'on a, fait un livre aussi solide et aussi serieux que celui-la, on n'a besoin, d'etre rassure par personne; ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager, moi-meme que je constate dans Sapho encore une preuve--a ajouter a, celles que vous avez donnees--de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir, comme revelation de la vie et du drole de melange que nous sommes. La, fille est etudiee avec une patience merveilleuse--c'est un de ces, portraits qui epuisent un type. Je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune, homme un peu sacrifie--comme etude et comme recherche--sa figure me, paraissant moins eclairee--en comparaison de celle de la femme--qu'il ne, le faudrait pour l'nteret moral la valeur tragique. J'aurais voulu que, vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par ou il a passe--en matiere, d'experience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries, avec Fanny--en matiere de rammollissement de volonte et de relachement, d'ame. En un mot, le drame ne se passe peut-etre pas assez dans l'ame et, dans la conscience de Jean. C'est a mesure que nous touchons a son, caractere meme que la situation devient interessante--et ce caractere\\n\\nin the shape of stuffy midsummer heat (that of this metropolis has a, truly British ponderosity--it's as dull as an article in a Quarterly,), smoke, circulars, invitations, _bills_, the one sauce that Talleyrand, commemorated, and reverberations of the grotesque Jubilee. On the other, hand my small house seems most pleasant and peculiar (in the sense of, being my own,) and my servants are as punctual as they are prim--which, is saying much. But I enjoyed my absence, and I shall endeavour to, repeat it every year, for the future, on a smaller scale; that is, to, leave London, not at the beginning of the winter but at the end, by the, mid-April, and take the period of the insufferable Season regularly in, Italy. It was a great satisfaction to me to find that I am as fond of, that dear country as I ever was--and that its infinite charm and, interest are one of the things in life to be most relied upon. I was, afraid that the dryness of age--which drains us of so many, sentiments--had reduced my old _tendresse_ to a mere memory. But no--it, is really so much in my pocket, as it were, to feel that Italy is always, there. It is rather rude, my dear Grace, to say all this to you--for, whom it is there to so little purpose. But if I should observe this, scruple about all the places that you don't go to, or are not in, when I, write to you, my writing would go very much on one leg. I was back again, in Venice--where I paid a second visit late in the season (from the, middle of May to July 1st)--when I got your last letter. I was staying, at the Palazzo Barbaro, with the Daniel Curtises--the happy owners\\n\\n, I have a very bad conscience and a very heavy heart about my failure to, communicate with you again before you left Rome--for I heard, (afterwards--_much_ afterwards) that you had had final trouble and, inconvenience--that Miss Gertrude, brave being, tempted providence--by, her very bravery--to renew its assaults--and that illness and, complications encumbered your last steps. On the subject of all this I, ought long since to have condoled with you, in default of having, condoled at the time--yet lo, I have shamefully waited for the ignoble, facility of my own table and inkstand, to which, after too prolonged a, separation, I have but just been restored. I got home--from Turin--but, three days ago--and very, very cool and green and wholesome (though only, comparatively, I admit) does this little insular nook appear. After I, last saw you I too was caught up, if not cast down, by the, Fates--whirled, by irresistible Marion Crawfords--off to Sorrento\\n\\nembarrassments, the \\\"decline,\\\" in a word, of old England, go to my, heart, and I can imagine no spectacle more touching, more thrilling and, even dramatic, than to see this great precarious, artificial empire, on, behalf of which, nevertheless, so much of the strongest and finest stuff, of the greatest race (for such they are) has been expended, struggling, with forces which perhaps, in the long run, will prove too many for it., If she only will struggle, and not collapse and surrender and give up a, part which, looking at Europe as it is to-day, still may be great, the, drama will be well worth watching from [such] a good, near standpoint as, I have here. But I didn't mean to be so beastly political! Another drama, interesting me is the question of poor dear J. R. Lowell's possible, recall after Cleveland mounts the throne. This, to me, is tragic\\n\\nof such things, repeated to me the few meagre elements of a small and, gruesome spectral story that had been told _him_ years before and that, he could only give the dimmest account of--partly because he had, forgotten details and partly--and much more--because there had _been_ no, details and no coherency in the tale as he received it, from a person, who also but half knew it. The vaguest essence only was there--some dead, servants and some children. This essence _struck_ me and I made a note, of it (of a most scrappy kind) on going home. There the note remained, till this autumn, when, struck with it afresh, I wrought it into a, fantastic fiction which, first intended to be of the briefest, finally, became a thing of some length and is now being \\\"serialised\\\" in an, American periodical. It will appear late in the spring (chez Heinemann), in a volume with _one_ other story, and then I will send it to you. In, the meanwhile please think of the _doing_ of the thing on my part as, having sprung from that kind old evening at Addington--quite gruesomely, as my unbridled imagination caused me to see the inevitable development, of the subject. It was all worth mentioning to you. I am very busy and, very decently fit and very much yours, always, my dear Arthur\\n\\nthanked to satiety as I am on all sides, don't set your ponderous, machinery in motion to drop the last straw!\\\" So I've put out the fires, and stopped the wheels and paid off the stokers till now. I've held my, tongue like an angel, but I've thought of you--and of your matchless, mate--like--well, if not _a_, at least, _the_ devil, and at last the, whole shop insists on beginning again to hum. I cherish your so, periodical and so munificent thoughts of me as one of the good things of, this world of worries. Nothing ever touches me more. I am finally going, abroad for three months--on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the little, sensitive blank record, in its little green sheath, accompanies me--to, drink in Impressions--in the usual itinerant shrine of your gifts: my, left-hand upper waistcoat-pocket. There are vulgar things--a watch, an, eyeglass, seven-and-sixpence--in the other pockets; but nothing but, _you_ in that one. Voila. I go to Italy after more than 5 years, interlude.\\n\\nwhere the death of Turgenev had made a gap that he greatly felt. For the, rest of the year he was occupied in writing The Bostonians, and went no, further from London than to carry his manuscript into lodgings at Dover, for August and September. A little later his sister Alice arrived from, America, to make the experiment of life in Europe for the benefit of her, now confirmed ill-health. Her presence near at hand, for the few years, that remained to her, was a source of much pleasure, and also of, constant anxiety, to her brother. She was a woman of rare talent and of, strongly marked character; but the life of an invalid, which proved to, be all she was capable of, prevented her from using her opportunities, and from taking the place that would have been open to her. She lived in, great retirement, at first in London, afterwards chiefly at Bournemouth, and Leamington. Henry James was unwearied in his care for her; he, visited her constantly, and never without keen delight in her company, and her vigorous talk. His brotherly attention had yet a further reward, in the summer of 1885, when she was at Bournemouth. To be near her he, spent several weeks there, and was able at the same time to cultivate, the society of another imprisoned invalid, close by, with whom he had, already had some acquaintance. This was Robert Louis Stevenson, and the, intimacy that thus arose very fortunately still survives in many, admirable letters of each to the other. Stevenson's side of the, correspondence, edited by Sir Sidney Colvin, is well known, and Henry, James's can now be added to it; there could be no more illuminating, interchange between two fine artists, so unlike in everything but their, common passion.\\n\\nreally, of recumbency, later, I've been saddled with it for life, and, that even now, my dear Howard, I verily write you _with_ it. I even, wrote _The Awkward Age_ with it: therefore look sharp! I wanted, especially to send you that volume--as an \\\"acknowledgment\\\" of princely, hospitalities received, and formed the intention of so doing even in the, too scant moments we stood face to face among the Rembrandts. That's, right--_be_ one of the few! I greatly applaud the tact with which you, tell me that scarce a human being will understand a word, or an, intention, or an artistic element or glimmer of any sort, of my book. I, tell _myself_--and the \\\"reviews\\\" tell me--such truths in much cruder, fashion. But it's an old, old story--and if I \\\"minded\\\" now as much as I, once did, I should be well beneath the sod. Face to face I should be, able to say a bit how I saw--and why I _so_ saw--my subject. But that, will keep.\\n\\nin an uninterrupted crescendo, all through October and November. All the, good that I hoped of the place has, in fine, profusely bloomed and, flourished here. It was really at about the end of September, when the, various summer supernumeraries had quite faded away, that the special, note of Rye, the feeling of the little hilltop community, bound together, like a very modest, obscure and impecunious, but virtuous and amiable, family, began most unmistakably to come out. This is the present note of, life here, and it has floated me (excuse mixture of metaphor) very, placidly along. Nothing would induce me now _not_ to be here for, Christmas and nothing will induce me not to do my best at least to be, here for the protrusion of the bulbs--the hyacinths and tulips and, crocuses--that, in return for expended shillings, George Gammon promises, me for the earliest peep of spring. As he has broken no word with me, yet, I trust him implicitly for this. Meantime too I have trusted him\\n\\nGuicciardinis, Rucellais, etc., mounted on magnificent horses and, wearing admirable dresses with the childlike gallantry and glee with, which only Italians can wear them, riding through the brown old streets, and followed by an immense train of citizens all in the carefullest, quattro-cento garb. This was really a noble picture and testified to the, latent love of splendour which is still in those dear people and which, only asks for a favouring chance to shine out, even at the cost of, ruining them. Before leaving Italy I spent a week with Mrs. Kemble at, Lago Maggiore--she having dipped over there, in spite of torrid heat., She is a very (or at least a partly) extinct volcano to-day, and very, easy and delightful to dwell with, in her aged resignation and, _adoucissements_. But she did suggest to me, on seeing her again after, so long an interval, that it is rather a melancholy mistake, in this, uncertain life of ours, to have founded oneself on so many rigidities, and rules--so many siftings and sortings. Mrs. Kemble is _toute d'une, piece_, more than any one, probably, that ever lived; she moves in a, mass, and if she does so little as to button her glove it is the whole, of her \\\"personality\\\" that does it. Let us be flexible, dear Grace; let, us be flexible! and even if we don't reach the sun we shall at least, have been up in a balloon.--I left Stresa on the 15th of this month, had, a glorious day on the Simplon amid mountain streams and mountain, flowers, and came quickly home.... I shall be here for the rest of the, summer--save for little blotches of absence--and I look forward to some, quiet months of work. I am trying, not without success, to get out of, society--as hard as some people try to get in. I want to be dropped and, cut and consummately ignored. This only demands a little patience, and I, hope eventually to elbow my way down to the bottom of the wave--to, achieve an obscurity. This would sound fatuous if I didn't add that, success is easily within my grasp. I know it all--all that one sees by, \\\"going out\\\"--to-day, as if I had made it. But if I had, I would have, made it better! I think of you on your porch--amid all your creepers and, tendrils; and wherever you are, dear Grace, I am your very faithful and, much remembering friend\\n\\n, It is an immense satisfaction to get your news--and no figure of speech, to say that it has found me literally on the point of reaching out, for, it, into the thick twilight of your whereabouts. I have had my general, silence much on my conscience--and especially my dumbness and darkness, to Rosina and Bay, for whom my movements must have been enveloped in a, perfidious mystery that has caused me, I fear, to forfeit all their, esteem. But let me tell you first of all how I rejoice in your good, conditions and in your having found your feet. It was \\\"borne in\\\" upon, me, on general grounds, that Southwold would never do for long, and it, is charming that you have found so near and so nice a substitute. I, especially delight (without wanting to sacrifice the rest of you) in, such a letting-down-easy of the Art-Daughters. Please give them my, tender love and tell them that, preposterous as it sounds, I have never\\n\\nI would have you know: it would have flown straight up the chimney and, taken, unscathed as marble, its invulnerable way to the individual for, whom it had just been so admirably winged. You say to me exactly the, right things, and you say them to exactly the right person. I can't tell, you how glad I am for you that you have all that highest sanity and, soundness (though it isn't as if I doubted it!) of emotion, full, frank, and deep. If there be a wisdom in not feeling--to the last throb--the, great things that happen to us, it is a wisdom I shall never either know, or esteem. Let your soul live--it's the only life that isn't, on the, whole, a sell. You have evidently been magnificent, and as I have my, hand on your shoulder I take the opportunity of patting you very, tenderly on the back. That back will evidently carry its load and be all, the straighter for the--as it seems to me--really quite massive, experience. I rejoice that the waters have held you up--they do, always\\n\\nAm asking very great favour of your coming down for inside of day or for, night if possible house took fire last night but only Green Room and, Dining Room affected hot hearth in former igniting old beam beneath with, tiresome consequences but excellent local brigade's help am now helpless, in face of reconstructions of injured portions and will bless you, mightily if you come departure of course put off Henry James.\\n\\n, I should be a poor creature if I had read your two last volumes without, feeling the liveliest desire to write to you. That is the desire you, must have kindled indeed in more quarters than you will care to reckon, with; but even this reflection doesn't stay my pen, save to make me, parenthise that I should be absolutely distressed to receive from you, any acknowledgment of these few lines.\\n\\nIf anything can give to those who did not know him an impression of, Henry James's talk, it will be some of the finest of these later, letters. One difference indeed is immediately to be marked. His, pondering hesitation as he talked, his search over the whole field of, expression for the word that should do justice to the picture forming in, his mind--this gives place in the letters to a flow unchecked, one, sonorous phrase uncoiling itself after another without effort. Pen in, hand, or, as he finally preferred, dictating to his secretary, it was, apparently easier for him to seize upon the images he sought to detach\\n\\nThe relic in question consists of certain pencilled pages, found among, his papers, in which he speaks with only himself for listener. They, belong to the same order as the notes for the unfinished novels, but, they are even more informal and confidential. Nothing else of the kind, seems to have survived; the schemes and motives that must have swarmed, in his brain, far too numerously for notation, have all vanished but, this one. At Rye, some years before the end, he began one night to feel, his way towards a novel which he had in mind--a subject afterwards, abandoned in the form projected at first. The rough notes in which he, casts about to clear the ground are mostly filled with the mere details, of his plan--the division of the action, the characters required, a, tentative scenario. These I pass over in order to quote some passages, where he suddenly breaks away, leaves his imaginary scene, and, surrenders to the awe and wonder of finding himself again, where he has, so often stood before, on the threshold and brink of creation. It is as, though for once, at an hour of midnight silence and solitude, he opened, the innermost chamber of his mind and stood face to face with his, genius. There is no moment of all his days in which it is now possible, to approach him more closely. Such a moment represented to himself the, pith of life--the first tremor of inspiration, in which he might be, almost afraid to stir or breathe, for fear of breaking the spell, if it, were not that he goes to meet it with a peculiar confidence.\\n\\n, Ever since receiving and reading your elegant volume of short tales--the, arrival of which from you was affecting and delightful to me--I've meant, to write to you, but the wish has struggled in vain with the daily, distractions of a tolerably busy summer. I should blush, however, if the, season were to melt away without my greeting and thanking you. I read, your book with joy and found in it recalls from far far away--stray, echoes and scents as from another, the American, the prehistoric, existence. The thing that most took me was that entitled A Difficult, Case, which I found beautiful and admirable, ever so true and ever so, _done_. But I fear I more, almost, than anything else, lost myself in, mere envy of your freedom to do, and, speaking vulgarly, to place\\n\\n, Your generous letter has, this wild, mild, soft, sombre morning, made me, feel as if I were standing beside you, with my hand on your shoulder, in, an embrasure of one of the windows--at that fine old Farnham Castle that, I have seen (years ago)--that look out on the noble things you speak, of. And the communication in question is worthy, exactly, of the, _things_ in question; and grave and handsome and interesting and, touching even as they are. \\\"Burn\\\" it, quotha!--it _wouldn't_ have burnt\\n\\n, I have never yet thanked you for the amiable note in which you kindly, invited me to write to you from the Americas; and the best way I can do, so now is to simply respond to your invitation. I am in the Americas, indeed, and behold I write. These countries are extremely pleasant, and, I recommend you to come and see them au plus tot. You would have a great, career here, and would return--if you should return at all--with a, multitude of scalps at your slim girdle. There is a great demand for, brilliant women, and I can promise you that you would be intimately, appreciated. I shall return about the first of May--but without any, blond scalps, though with a great many happy impressions. Though I, should perhaps not linger upon the point myself, I believe I have had a, certain success. As for ces gens-ci, they have had great success with, me, and have been delightfully genial and hospitable. It is here that, people treat you well; venez-y voir. You have had a great many things, I, know; but you have not had a winter in the Americas. The people are, extremely nice and humane. I didn't care for it much at first--but it, improves immensely on acquaintance, and after you have got the right, point of view and _diapason_ it is a wonderfully entertaining and, amusing country. The skies are as blue as the blotting paper (as yet, unspotted) on which this scrawl reposes, and the sunshine, which is, deliciously warm, has always an air de fete. I have seen multitudes of, people, and no one has been disagreeable. That is different from your, pretentious Old World. Of Washington I can speak as yet but little\\n\\nsuperior enough, to say _anything_, for conversation, later. It's in the, light of unlimited conversation that I see the future years, and my, honoured chair by the ingleside will require a succession of new, cushions. I miss you shockingly--for, my dear fellow, there is no, one--literally no one; and I don't in the least follow you--I can't go, with you (I mean in conceptive faculty and the \\\"realising sense,\\\") and, you are for the time absolutely as if you were dead to me--I mean to my, imagination of course--not to my affection or my prayers. And so I shall, keep humble that you may pump into me--and make me stare and sigh and, look simple and be quite out of it--for ever and ever. It's the best, thing that can happen to one to see it written in your very hand that, you have been so uplifted in health and cheer, and if another year will, screw you up so tight that you won't \\\"come undone\\\" again, I will try and, hold on through the barren months. I will go to Mrs. Sitwell, to hear, what has made you blush--it must be something very radical. Your, chieftains are dim to me--why shouldn't they be when you yourself are?, _Va_ for another year--but don't stay away longer, for we should really\\n\\n, ...I was much depressed on reading your letter by your painful, reflections on _The Europeans_; but now, an hour having elapsed, I am, beginning to hold up my head a little; the more so as I think I myself, estimate the book very justly and am aware of its extreme slightness. I, think you take these things too rigidly and unimaginatively--too much as, if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct, to which one's life, were somehow committed; but I think also that you're quite right in, pronouncing the book 'thin' and empty. I don't at all despair, yet, of, doing something fat. Meanwhile I hope you will continue to give me, when, you can, your free impression of my performances. It is a great thing to, have some one write to one of one's things as if one were a third, person, and you are the only individual who will do this. I don't think, however you are always right, by any means. As for instance in your, objection to the closing paragraph of _Daisy Miller_, which seems to me, queer and narrow, and as regards which I don't seize your point of view., J'en appelle to the sentiment of any other story-teller whatsoever; I am, sure none such would wish the paragraph away. You may say--'Ah, but, other _readers_ would.' But that is the same; for the teller is but a, more developed reader. I don't trust your judgment altogether (if you, will permit me to say so) about _details_; but I think you are, altogether right in returning always to the importance of subject. I, hold to this, strongly; and if I don't as yet seem to proceed upon it, more, it is because, being 'very artistic,' I have a constant impulse to, try experiments of form, in which I wish to not run the risk of wasting, or gratuitously using big situations. But to these I am coming now. It, is something to have learned how to write, and when I look round me and, see how few people (doing my sort of work) know how (to my sense,) I, don't regret my step-by-step evolution. I don't advise you however to, read the two last things I have written--one a thing in the Dec. and, Jan. _Cornhill_, which I will send home; and the other a piece I am just, sending to Howells. They are each quite in the same manner as _The, Europeans_.\\n\\n, A laggard in response you and Alice will indeed feel that I have become., I've had for three or four days your so interesting and relieving letter, dictated to Alice at the hour of poor Myers's death, and though it, greatly eased me off (as to my fears that the whole thing would have, worn you out,) yet till this moment my hand has been stayed. I wrote you, very briefly, moreover, as soon as the papers here gave the news., Blessed seems it to have been that everything round about Myers was so, sane and comfortable; the reasonableness and serenity of his wife and, children etc., not to speak of his own high philosophy, which it must, have been fine to see in operation. But I hope the sequel hasn't been, prolonged, and have been supposing that, by the necessary quick, departure of his \\\"party,\\\" you will have been left independent again and, not too exhausted. We here, on our side, have been gathering close, round the poor old dying and dead Queen, and are plunged in universal, mourning tokens--which accounts for my black-edged paper. It has really, been, the event, most moving, interesting and picturesque. I have felt, _more_ moved, much, than I should have expected (such is _community_ of, sentiment,) and one has realized all sorts of things about the brave old, woman's beneficent duration and holding-together virtue. The thing has, been journalistically overdone, of course--greatly; but the people have, appeared to advantage--serious and sincere and decent--_really_ caring., Meanwhile the drama of the accession, new reign, &c., has its lively, spectacular interest--even with the P. of W. for hero. I dined last, night in company with some Privy Councillors who had met him, ceremonially, in the a.m., and they said (John Morley in particular, said) that he made a very good impression. Speriamo!\\n\\nsafe and secret, though there are three or four copies in existence), which makes me feel as if there had been a triumphant premiere and I had, received overtures from every managerial quarter and had only to count, my gold. At any rate I am delighted that you have been struck with it, exactly as I have tried to strike, and that the pure practical character, of the effort has worked its calculated spell upon you. For what, encourages me in the whole business is that, as the piece stands, there, is not, in its felicitous form, the ghost of a \\\"fluke\\\" or a mere chance:, it is all \\\"art\\\" and an absolute address of means to the end--the end\\n\\n, I've been very uncivilly silent, but I've also been still more dismally, hindered--I mean ever since receiving your good note of Feb. 22d. It, found me wearily, drearily ill, in bed; such had been my state ever, since Jan. 29th, and it ceased to be my state only ten days ago--since, when I have sat feebly staring at a mountain of unanswered letters. I, did go to London, Jan. 27th, but was immediately stricken, and scrambled, back here to be more commodiously prostrate. I've had to stay and, recuperate. But I am infinitely better--only universally behind. Still\\n\\nthings of that particular and so agreeable dimension--I mean the, dimension of most of the stories in the volume. It is sternly enjoined, upon one here (where an agent-man does what he can for me) that, everything--every hundred--above 6 or 7 thousand words is fatal to, \\\"placing\\\"; so that I do them of that length, with great care, art and, time (much reboiling,) and then, even then, can scarcely get them worked, off--published even when they've been accepted.... So that (though I, don't know why I inflict on you these sordid groans--except that I, haven't any one else to inflict them on--and the mere affront--of being, unused so inordinately long--is almost intolerable) I don't feel incited, in that direction. Fortunately, however, I am otherwise immersed. I, lately finished a tolerably long novel, and I've written a third of, another--with still another begun and two or three more subjects, awaiting me thereafter like carriages drawn up at the door and horses, champing their bits. And apropos of the first named of these, which is, in the hands of the Harpers, I have it on my conscience to let you know, that the idea of the fiction in question had its earliest origin in a, circumstance mentioned to me--years ago--in respect to no less a person, than yourself. At Torquay, once, our young friend Jon. Sturges came down, to spend some days near me, and, lately from Paris, repeated to me five, words you had said to him one day on his meeting you during a call at, Whistler's. I thought the words charming--you have probably quite, forgotten them; and the whole incident suggestive--so far as it was an, incident; and, more than this, they presently caused me to see in them, the faint vague germ, the mere point of the _start_, of a subject. I, noted them, to that end, as I note everything; and years afterwards, (that is three or four) the subject sprang at me, one day, out of my, notebook. I don't know if it be good; at any rate it has been treated\\n\\nor those of disappointment and depression that have followed it; from, which last, however, I am rapidly and resolutely, thank God, emerging., The \\\"papers\\\" have, into the bargain, been mainly ill-natured and densely, stupid and vulgar; but the only two dramatic critics who count, W., Archer and Clement Scott, have done me more justice. Meanwhile all, _private_ opinion is apparently one of extreme admiration--I have been, flooded with letters of the warmest protest and assurance.... Everyone, who was there has either written to me or come to see me--I mean every, one I know and many people I don't. Obviously the little play, which I, strove to make as broad, as simple, as clear, as British, in a word, as, possible, is over the heads of the _usual_ vulgar theatre-going London, public--and the chance of its going for a while (which it is too early, to measure) will depend wholly on its holding on long enough to attract, the _unusual_. I was there the second night (Monday, 7th) when, before a, full house--a remarkably good \\\"money\\\" house Alexander told me--it went, singularly well. But it's soon to see or to say, and I'm prepared for, the worst. The thing fills me with horror for the abysmal vulgarity and, brutality of the theatre and its regular public, which God knows I have, had intensely even when working (from motives as \\\"pure\\\" as pecuniary, motives _can_ be) against it; and I feel as if the simple freedom of, mind thus begotten to return to one's legitimate form would be simply by, itself a divine solace for everything. Don't worry about me: I'm a Rock., If the play has no life on the stage I shall publish it; it's altogether, the best thing I've done. You would understand better the elements of, the case if you had seen the thing it followed (_The Masqueraders_) and, the thing that is now succeeding at the Haymarket--the thing of Oscar, Wilde's. On the basis of _their_ being plays, or successes, my thing is, necessarily neither. Doubtless, moreover, the want of a roaring, actuality, simplified to a few big _familiar_ effects, in my subject--an, episode in the history of an old English Catholic family in the last, century--militates against it, with all usual theatrical people, who, don't want plays (from variety and nimbleness of fancy) of different, _kinds_, like books and stories, but only of one kind, which their, stiff, rudimentary, clumsily-working vision recognizes as the kind, they've had before. And yet I had tried so to meet them! But you can't, make a sow's ear out of a silk purse.--I can't write more--and don't ask, for more details. This week will probably determine the fate of the, piece. If there is increased advance-booking it will go on. If there, isn't, it will be withdrawn, and with it all my little hope of profit., The time one has given to such an affair from the very first to the very, last represents in all--so inconceivably great, to the uninitiated, is, the amount--a pitiful, tragic bankruptcy of hours that might have been, rendered retroactively golden. But I am not plangent--one must take the, thick with the thin--and I have such possibilities of another and better, sort before me. I am only sorry for your and Alice's having to be so, sorry for yours forever\\n\\nthere is something that holds one in one's place, makes it a standpoint, in the universe which it is probably good not to forsake. You are right, in your consciousness that we are all echoes and reverberations of the, _same_, and you are noble when your interest and pity as to everything, that surrounds you, appears to have a sustaining and harmonizing power., Only don't, I beseech you, _generalize_ too much in these sympathies and, tendernesses--remember that every life is a special problem which is not, yours but another's, and content yourself with the terrible algebra of, your own. Don't melt too much into the universe, but be as solid and, dense and fixed as you can. We all live together, and those of us who, love and know, live so most. We help each other--even unconsciously\\n\\nare very close and charming company to me as I sit scribbling--writing, many notes among other things--in still, indoor days that are grateful, to me. You were one of the very few persons in England who had seen my, sister even a little--and I am very glad of that. She was a rare and, remarkable being, and her death makes a great difference in my, existence. But for her it is only blessed. I hope you are happy in the, good reasons you have for being so--if one _is_ happy strictly, (certainly one isn't the reverse) for \\\"reasons.\\\"\\n\\n, Your so liberal and graceful letter is to my head like coals of fire--so, repeatedly for all these weeks have I had feebly to suffer frustrations, in the matter of trundling over the marsh to ask for your news and wish, for your continued amendment. The shortening days and the deepening mud, have been at the bottom of this affair. I never get out of the house, till 3 o'clock, when night is quickly at one's heels. I would have taken, a regular day--I mean started in the a.m.--but have been so ridden\\n\\ngenerally, and the English character have, a certain number of great, plump flourishing uglinesses and drearinesses which offer themselves, irresistibly as pin-cushions to criticism and irony. The British mind is, so totally un-ironical in relation to itself that this is a perpetual, temptation. You will know the things I mean--you will remember them--let, that suffice. Non ragioniam di lor!--I don't suppose you will envy me, for having dined out 107 times--you will simply wonder what can have, induced me to perpetrate such a folly, and how I have survived to tell, the tale! I admit that it is enough for the present, and for the rest of, the summer I shall take in sail. When the warm weather comes I find, London evenings very detestable, and I marvel at the powers of endurance, of my fellow \\\"factors,\\\" as it is now the fashion to call human, beings--(actors--poor blundering unapplauded Comedians would be a better, name). Would you like a little gossip? I am afraid I have nothing very, lively in hand; but I take what comes uppermost. I am to dine tonight at, Sir Frederick Pollock's, to meet one or two of the (more genteel), members of the Comedie Francaise, who are here just now, playing with, immense success and supplying the London world with that invaluable, boon, a topic. I mean the whole Comedie is here _en masse_ for six, weeks. I have been to see them two or three times and I find their, artistic perfection gives one an immense lift out of British air. I took, with me one night Mrs. Kemble, who is a great friend of mine and to my, sense one of the most interesting and delightful of women. I have a sort, of notion you don't like her; but you would if you knew her better. She, is to my mind the first woman in London, and is moreover one of the, consolations of my life. Another night I had with me a person whom it, would divert you to know--a certain Mrs. Greville (a cousin, by, marriage, of the Greville Papers:) the queerest creature living, but a, mixture of the ridiculous and the amiable in which the amiable, preponderates. She is crazy, stage-struck, scatter-brained, what the, French call _extravagante_; but I can't praise her better than by saying, that though she is on the whole the greatest fool I have ever known, I, like her very much and get on with her most easily.... I am just, finishing a short novel which will appear presently in six numbers of, Scribner. This is to say please don't read it in that puerile periodical, (where its appearance is due to--what you will be glad to hear--large, pecuniary inducements,) but wait till it comes out as a book. It is, worth being read in that shape. I have asked you no questions--yet I, have finished my letter. Let my blessing, my tender good wishes and, affectionate assurances of every kind stand instead of them. Divide, these with Charles, with your mother, with the children, and believe me\\n\\nwhen you write me so kindly about the hideous American episode--almost, the worst feature of which is that I don't either like or trust the new, President, a dangerous and ominous Jingo--of whom the most hopeful thing, to say is that he may be rationalized by this sudden real, responsibility. _Speriamo_, as we used to say in the golden age, in the, heavenly mansion, along with the ministering angel, long, long ago. And, all thanks meanwhile for your sympathetic thought. It must indeed--the, base _success_ of the act--cause a sinking of the heart among the, potentates in circulation. One wonders, for instance, just now, who is, most nervous, the poor little Tsar for himself or M. Loubet for him. Let, us thank our stars that we are not travelling stars, I not even a, Loubet, nor you a Loubette, and that though we have many annoyances we, are probably not marked for the dagger of the assassin.\\n\\nI hope you have by this time roared--and not _wholly_ with rage and, despair!--through the tunnel of your dark consciousness of return. I, dare say you are now quite out on the flowery meads of almost doubting, of having been away. This makes me fear your promise to come back--right, soon--next summer--may even now have developed an element of base, alloy. I rushed off to see Mrs. Harland the instant I heard _she_ was, back, and got hold of you--and of Mildred--for five minutes (and of all, the handsomest parts of both of you) in her talk. She had left a dying, mother, however, and her general situation has, I fear, its pressure and, pinch. What an interest indeed your boy's outlook must be to you! But\\n\\nhow such an ordeal--odious in its essence!--is only made tolerable and, palatable by great success; and in how many ways accordingly non-success, may be tormenting and tragic, a bitterness of every hour, ramifying into, every throb of one's consciousness. Tonight the thing will have lived, the whole of its troubled little life of 31 performances, and will be, \\\"taken off,\\\" to be followed, on Feb. 5th, by a piece by Oscar Wilde that, will have probably a very different fate. On the night of the 5th, too, nervous to do anything else, I had the ingenious thought of going to, some other theatre and seeing some other play as a means of being, coerced into quietness from 8 till 10.45. I went accordingly to the, Haymarket, to a new piece by the said O.W. that had just been, produced--\\\"An Ideal Husband.\\\" I sat through it and saw it played with, every appearance (so far as the crowded house was an appearance) of, complete success, and _that_ gave me the most fearful apprehension. The, thing seemed to me so helpless, so crude, so bad, so clumsy, feeble and, vulgar, that as I walked away across St. James's Square to learn my own, fate, the prosperity of what I had seen seemed to me to constitute a, dreadful presumption of the shipwreck of _G.D._, and I stopped in the, middle of the Square, paralyzed by the terror of this, probability--afraid to go on and learn more. \\\"How _can_ my piece do, anything with a public with whom _that_ is a success?\\\" It couldn't--but, even then the full truth was, \\\"mercifully,\\\" not revealed to me; the, truth that in a short month my piece would be whisked away to make room, for the triumphant Oscar. If, as I say, this episode has, by this time\\n\\nthat I mention August 1904 very advisedly. If I want (and it's half the, battle) to go to the West and South, and even, dreamably, to Mexico, I, [could not] do these things during that part of the summer during which, (besides feeling, I fear, very ill from the heat) I should simply have, to sit still. On the other hand I should like immensely not to fail of, coming in for the _whole_ American autumn, and like hugely, in especial\\n\\n, Let my first word be to ask you to pardon this vulgar machinery and this, portentous legibility: the fruit of dictation, in the first place (now, made absolutely necessary to me;) and the fruit, in the second place, of, the fact that, pegging away as I am at present, in your interest and, Waldo's (and with the end of our business now, I am happy to say, well, in sight), I so live, as it were, from day to day and from hour to hour\\n\\nAnd may I say (as I _can_ read nothing, if I read it at all, save in the, light of how one would _one's self_ proceed in tackling the same, _data_!) just two other things? One is that I think your material, suffers a little from the fact that the reader feels you approach your, subject too _immediately_, show him its elements, the cards in your, hand, too bang off from the first page--so that a wait to begin to guess, _what and whom the thing is going to be about_ doesn't impose itself:, the ante-chamber or two and the crooked corridor before he is already in, the Presence. The other is that you don't give him a positive sense of, dealing with your subject from its logical centre. This centre I, gathered to be, from what you told me in Rome (and one gathers it also, from the title,) the consciousness of Eleanor--to which all the rest, (Manisty, Lucy, the whole phantasmagoria and drama) is presented by, life. I should have urged you: \\\"Make that consciousness full, rich\\n\\nclashed against the artificial restraints, as they seemed, of physical, age; whenever these were relaxed, it leaped forward to work again. The, challenge of the war with Germany roused him to a height of passion he, had never touched before in the outer world; and if the strain of it, exhausted his strength, as well it might, it gave him one last year of, the fullest and deepest experience, perhaps, that he had ever known. It, wore out his body, which was too tired and spent to live longer; but he, carried away the power of his spirit still in its prime.\\n\\nfor self-defence, have to outlive [?] you.... I myself do little but sit, at home and write little tales--and even long ones--you shall see them, when you come back. Nothing would induce me, by sending them to you, to, expose myself to damaging Polynesian comparisons. For the rest, there is, nothing in this land but the eternal Irish strife--the place is all, gashed and gory with it. I can't tell you of it--I am too sick of, it--more than to say that two or three of the most interesting days I, ever passed were lately in the crowded, throbbing, thrilling little, court of the Special Commission, over the astounding drama of the forged, _Times_ letters.\\n\\nbut of divine magnanimity and gentleness. You appear to have spoken to, her \\\"as if you still liked me,\\\" and I like you so much for that that the, vibration has started these stammering accents. I really write you these, words not from my peaceful hermitage by the southern sea, but from the, depths of the meretricious metropolis, which I've never known so, detestable as at this most tawdry of crises, and from which I hope to, escape in a day or two, utterly dodging the insane crush of the, Coronation. The place is vilely disfigured by league-long hoardings (for, spectators at L10 0. 0. a head,) and cheap and awful decorations, and, the dear old Abbey in particular smothered into the likeness of the, Earl's Court Exhibition--not to be distinguished from the Westminster, Aquarium, in fact, opposite. And then the crowds, the gregarious, gaping, millions, are appalling, and I fly, in fine, back to the Southern, Sea--on the shore of which I've spent almost all my time for almost a, year past. I've lately been dabbling a little, for compensation, in, town; but I find small doses of London now go further, for my, organisation, than they used.\\n\\nby the aid of this mechanism, that it is an effort to me to break with, it even for my correspondence. I had promised myself to write you so, that you should receive my letter on the very Capo d'Anno; and if I had, _then_ overcome my scruple as to launching at you a dictated thing, you, would some time ere this have been in possession of my news. I have, delayed till now because I was every day hoping to catch the right, moment to address you a page or two of my own proper hieroglyphics. But, one's Christmas-tide burden (of writing) here is heavy; I didn't snatch, the moment; and _this_ is a brave precaution lest it should again elude, me; which, in the interest of lucidity, please again forgive.\\n\\ngenerally, repay. My cell is spacious, southern, looking over Carlton, Gardens: and tranquil, utterly, and singularly well-serviced; and I find, I can work there--there being ample margin for a type-writer and its, priest, or even priestess. It all hung by _that_--but I think I am not, deceived; so I bear up. And the next time you come to perch at a, neighbouring establishment, I shall sweep down on you from my eyrie., It's astonishing how remote, cumbrous and expensive it makes 34 De Vere, Gardens seem. Worse luck that that millstone still dangles gracefully, from my neck!...\\n\\nAll thanks for your so vivid news of the overflow of Henley's gall. Ca, ne pouvait manquer--ca _devait_ venir. I have sent for the article and, will write you when I've read it. I gather from you that it's really, rather a striking and lurid--and so far interesting case--of long, discomfortable jealousy and ranklement turned at last to posthumous (as, it were!) malignity, and making the man do, coram publico, his ugly act\\n\\nand this morning my windows are lashed by a wet hurricane. It makes me, wish I could settle down to a luxurious irresponsible day with the, _Lourdes_ of your appreciation, which lies there on my table still, uncut. But my \\\"holiday\\\" is no holiday and I must drive the mechanic pen., Moreover I have vowed not to open _Lourdes_ till I shall have closed, with a final furious bang the unspeakable _Lord Ormont_, which I have, been reading at the maximum rate of ten pages--ten insufferable and, unprofitable pages, a day. It fills me with a critical rage, an artistic, fury, utterly blighting in me the indispensable principle of _respect_., I have finished, at this rate, but the first volume--whereof I am moved, to declare that I doubt if any equal quantity of extravagant verbiage\\n\\nfrankly, \\\"Mayn't I come down and _see_?--or hear?\\\" were it not that I, return to fearful arrears myself, and restored to this small temple of, application, from which I've so long been absent, feel absolutely, obliged to sit tight for several weeks to come. Later in the summer, if, you'll let me, I _shall_ ask for an invitation. If all this while I've, not sent you _The Awkward Age_ it has been because I thought it not fair, to make any such appeal to your attention while you were preoccupied and, worried. Perhaps--absolutely, in fact--I wanted the book to reach you at, a moment when the coast might be comparatively clear. Possibly it isn't, clear even now. At all events I am writing to Heinemann to-day to, despatch to you the volume. But _please_ don't look at it till all the, elements of leisure--margin--peace of mind--lend themselves. And don't, answer _this_. You have far other business in hand.\\n\\nI have had an autumn of things rather than of people, and have not much, to relate in regard to human nature. Here in Paris, for a few days, I, find I know really too many people--especially as they are for the most, part acquaintances retained for the sake of social decency rather than, of strong sentiment. They consume all my time, so that I can't even go, to the Theatre Francais! In Rome I found the relics and fragments of the, ancient American group, which has been much broken up--or rather broken, down. But neither in its meridian nor in its decline has it had any, very irresistible charms. The chief quality acquired by Americans who, have lived thirty years in Europe seems to me a fierce susceptibility on, the subject of omitted calls.\\n\\nJanuary 13th.--I met Colvin last night, after writing the above--in the, company of Sir James Stephen, Sir Theo. Martin, Sir Douglas Galton, Sir, James Paget, Sir Alfred Lyall, Canon Ainger, and George du Maurier. How, this will make you lick your chops over Ori and Rahiro and Tamatia and, Taheia--or whatever ces messieurs et ces dames, your present visiting, list, are called. He told me of a copious diary-letter he has just got, from you, bless you, and we are discussing a day on which I shall soon, come to meat or drink with him and listen to the same. Since yesterday I, have also read the ballad book--with the admiration that I always feel, as a helplessly verseless creature (it's a sentiment worth nothing as a, testimony) for all performances in rhyme and metre--especially on the, part of producers of fine prose.\\n\\nat any rate, the impression of the book remains, and I have infinitely, pleased myself, even in my shame, with thinking of the pleasure that, must have come to yourself from so acclaimed and attested a, demonstration of the freshness, within you still, of the spirit of, evocation. Delightful, in one's golden afternoon, and after many days, and many parturitions, to put forth thus a young, strong, living flower., You have done nothing more true and complete, more thoroughly, homogeneous and hanging-together, without the faintest ghost of a false, note or a weak touch--all as sharply ciphered-up and tapped-out as the, \\\"proof\\\" of a prize scholar's sum on a slate. It is in short miraculously, felt and beautifully done, and the aged--by which I mean the, richly-matured--sposi _as_ done as if sposi were a new and fresh idea to, you. Of all your sposi they are, I think, the most penetrated and most, penetrating. I took in short true comfort in the whole manifestation\\n\\n_my_ impression longs to complete itself) in the presence of voices in, the darkness--voices the more distinct and vivid, the more brave and, sonorous, as voices always are--but also the more tormenting and, confounding--by reason of these bandaged eyes. I utter a pleading moan, when you, e.g., transport your characters, toward the end, in a line or, two from Leyden to Dunkirk without the glint of a hint of all the, ambient picture of the 18th century road. However, stick to your own, system of evocation so long as what you positively achieve is so big., Life and letters and art all take joy in you.\\n\\ninconceivable. Life is too short a business and friendship too delicate, a matter for such tricks--for cutting great gory masses out of 'em by, the year at a time. Therefore come back. Hang it all--sink it all and, come back. A little more and I shall cease to believe in you: I don't, mean (in the usual implied phrase) in your veracity, but literally and, more fatally in your relevancy--your objective reality. You have become, a beautiful myth--a kind of unnatural uncomfortable unburied _mort_. You, put forth a beautiful monthly voice, with such happy notes in it--but it, comes from too far away, from the other side of the globe, while I, vaguely know that you are crawling like a fly on the nether surface of, my chair. Your adventures, no doubt, are wonderful; but I don't, successfully evoke them, understand them, believe in them. I do in those, you write, heaven knows--but I don't in those you perform, though the, latter, I know, are to lead to new revelations of the former and your, capacity for them is certainly wonderful enough. This is a selfish, personal cry: I wish you back; for literature is lonely and Bournemouth, is barren without you. Your place in my affection has not been usurped, by another--for there is not the least little scrap of another to usurp, it. If there were I would perversely try to care for him. But there, isn't--I repeat, and I literally care for nothing but your return. I, haven't even your novel to stay my stomach withal. The wan wet months, elapse and I see no sign of it. The beautiful portrait of your wife, shimmers at me from my chimney-piece--brought some months ago by the, natural McClure--but seems to refer to one as dim and distant and, delightful as a \\\"toast\\\" of the last century. I wish I could make you, homesick--I wish I could spoil your fun. It is a very featureless time., The summer is rank with rheumatism--a dark, drowned, unprecedented, season. The town is empty but I am not going away. I have no money, but, I have a little work. I have lately written several short fictions--but, you may not see them unless you come home. I have just begun a novel, which is to run through the _Atlantic_ from January 1st and which I, aspire to finish by the end of this year. In reality I suppose I shall, not be fully delivered of it before the middle of next. After that, with, God's help, I propose, for a longish period, to do nothing but short, lengths. I want to leave a multitude of pictures of my time, projecting, my small circular frame upon as many different spots as possible and, going in for number as well as quality, so that the number may, constitute a total having a certain value as observation and testimony., But there isn't so much as a creature here even to whisper such an, intention to. Nothing lifts its hand in these islands save blackguard, party politics. Criticism is of an abject density and puerility--it, doesn't exist--it writes the intellect of our race too low. Lang, in the, D.N., every morning, and I believe in a hundred other places, uses his, beautiful thin facility to write everything down to the lowest level of, Philistine twaddle--the view of the old lady round the corner or the, clever person at the dinner party. The incorporated society of authors, (I belong to it, and so do you, I think, but I don't know what it is), gave a dinner the other night to American literati to thank them for, praying for international copyright. I carefully forbore to go, thinking, the gratulation premature, and I see by this morning's _Times_ that the, banquetted boon is further off than ever. Edmund Gosse has sent me his, clever little life of Congreve, just out, and I have read it--but it, isn't so good as his Raleigh. But no more was the insufferable, subject.... Come, my dear Louis, grow not too thin. I can't question, you--because, as I say, I don't conjure you up. You have killed the, imagination in me--that part of it which formed your element and in, which you sat vivid and near. Your wife and Mother and Mr. Lloyd suffer, also--I must confess it--by this failure of breath, of faith. Of course, I have your letter--from Manasquan (is that the idiotic name?) of, the--ingenuous me, to think there was a date! It was terribly, impersonal--it did me little good. A little more and I shan't believe in, you enough to bless you. Take this, therefore, as your last chance. I, follow all with an aching wing, an inadequate geography and an, ineradicable hope. Ever, my dear Louis, yours, to the last snub--\\n\\nI think (or rather I am sure,) advice and direction. I have entered, upon evil days--but this is for your most private ear. It sounds, portentous, but it only means that I am still staggering a good deal, under the mysterious and (to me) inexplicable injury, wrought--apparently--upon my situation by my two last novels, the, _Bostonians_ and the _Princess_, from which I expected so much and, derived so little. They have reduced the desire, and the demand, for my, productions to zero--as I judge from the fact that though I have for a, good while past been writing a number of good short things, I remain, irremediably unpublished. Editors keep them back, for months and years\\n\\nof a grandly tragic sort, that I can conceive. Her Sundays seem rather, dingy and calculated to remind one of Concord 'historical games' etc., But it was both strange and sweet to see poor Turgenev acting charades, of the most extravagant description, dressed out in old shawls and, masks, going on all fours etc. The charades are their usual Sunday, evening occupation and the good faith with which Turgenev, at his age, and with his glories, can go into them is a striking example of that, spontaneity which Europeans have and we have not.

But in the midst of the intense, silence of the night better sense began to prevail.\\n\\nA hundred yards farther along the narrow ledge--a fault in the strata, which formed that side of the lake--and all doubt of their being at the, exit of the waters was at rest, for Melchior stopped short where the, ledge widened into a little platform at the angle of the rock forming, one of the sides of a mere crack in the titanic wall of perpendicular, mountain, which in places actually overhung them, and ran up fully a, thousand feet.\\n\\nIt never occurred to him that they could render no help, even if they, did catch sight of their unfortunate companion; for they were never less, than twenty feet above the narrow hissing and roaring stream, and there, was not a spot where a rock could be grasped: everything was worn too, smooth by the constant passage of the water, which doubtless carried, with it stones from the lake as well as those ever loosened by frost and, crumbling down from above, to aid in grinding the walls quite smooth.\\n\\nSaxe stood gazing upward with a feeling of awe creeping over him.  There, was no mistake about height here.  The line of snow, which ended as, quickly as if it had been cut square at one end, seemed terribly far, away; and Saxe was thinking that it seemed almost madness to try and, reach such a spot, when Melchior drew his attention to first one and, then another flake of ruddy light in the distance.\\n\\nFar below him as he fell he heard the snow and ice he had broken away go, hissing and whispering down for what seemed long after he had dropped;, and this gave him some idea of the terrible depth of the ice crack, and, a cold chill, that was not caused by the icy coldness of the place, ran, through him, as he wondered whether the rope, which now looked thin and, worn, would hold.  Then he thought that it might possibly cut against, the sharp edge, and after a sharp glance upward, to see nothing but the, blue sky, he could not keep from looking down into the black depths and, listening to the faint musical gurgle of running water.\\n\\nThe light was dying out fast on the peaks around, and they ceased to, flash and glow, to become pale and grey, and then ghastly, cold and, strange, as the little party sat enjoying the simple meal and the calm, and rest of the peaceful scene.  Everything around was so still that, there was hardly a murmur in the pines; only the hushed roar of the, restless river, but subdued now, for its waters were shrinking fast from, the failure of the supply; for the many thousand trickling rivulets of, melting snow, born of the hot sunshine of the day, were now being frozen, up hard.\\n\\nThen he shaded his eyes and gazed downward beneath the labyrinth of ice, blocks among which the smoother ice which had formed their path wound, its way; but for a long time he could see nothing of Dale, and he was, beginning to ask himself whether it was fancy, when there was another, hail, and soon after he caught sight of Dale's head and shoulders as he, climbed up the icy slope, and saw that the new rope was across his, breast.\\n\\nStrange places bring strange dreams, and often some hours of complete, oblivion.  Saxe began to dream with all his might.  Body and Brain had, been having the thorough rest which comes to those who have been walking, far in the glorious mountain air; but toward morning Brain woke up and, began to act on its own account, while Body lay asleep; and when Brain, does this without the balance given by Body, its workings are rather, wild.\\n\\nThe night passed quietly enough.  It was cold; and, at the height they, had reached, the stars shone out frostily; but the sleep was deliriously, refreshing, and Saxe rose the next morning ready for a journey to the, Black Ravine.  The mule was taken to carry back any specimens that they, might decide to bring away, and the goat insisted upon following, having, apparently no intention of being left alone, and setting Gros an, excellent example in climbing.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr--not for many hours: we must not wait for that;\\\" and he knelt, down now, and after rapidly chafing the half-dead limbs to bring back, the circulation, he took string from his pocket, cut off both sleeves of, his jacket, and then cleverly tied the wrists, and drew them on to the, boy's legs, where he bound them with the string, forming a pair of boots, and stockings in one.\\n\\nIn this position its head was in shelter, but the rain streamed down, upon its back and hind quarters, while a perfect deluge, like that from, a waterspout, ran down a long gully in the overhanging rock right on to, the spine just between the shoulders, and there divided to trickle on, either side down the fore legs, and then run down through the pine, needles, which formed too thick a bed for any of the water to make a, pool.\\n\\n\\\"Not so very deep,\\\" cried Saxe, as he prepared to throw down the other, piece; and, moving a few yards farther along towards the centre of the, glacier, he had poised the lump of ice in his hands, when there came a, peculiar hissing, whishing sound from far below and he shrank back, wondering, till it came to him by degrees that the piece he had thrown, down must have struck upon some ledge, shattered to fragments, and that, these pieces had gone on falling, till the hissing noise he had heard, was caused by their disappearing into water at some awful depth below.\\n\\n\\\"I'll believe in the bear before I believe in the gnome or kobold!\\\", cried Dale.  \\\"Oh, Melchior! now I have so far had so much respect for, you as a frank, manly Switzer, don't spoil it by trying to cloak an, error with a paltry excuse.  You did not properly secure the rope; it, came off; and it was an accident.  You know it was an accident, so let, it rest.\\\"\\n\\nThey had just turned the corner of a huge buttress of rock, and Dale, pointed up the valley to the wonderful panorama of mountain and glacier, which suddenly burst upon their view.  Snowy peak rising behind green, alps dotted with cattle, and beyond the glittering peak other pyramids, and spires of ice with cols and hollows full of unsullied snow, like, huge waves suddenly frozen, with their ridges, ripples, and curves, preserved.\\n\\n\\\"Nein--nein--nein--nein!\\\" shouted the old Swiss, and the donkey's bray, died off into a sobbing moan.  As this was ended, the old man jodelled, again, apparently without result; but soon after there was a snort, and, a peculiar-looking animal came trotting down from the mountain, whisking, its long tail from side to side and pointing its long ears forward.  But, as it came close up, it suddenly stopped, and spun round as if upon a, pivot.\\n\\nA month later, after a warm parting from old Andregg and his wife, who, made her apron quite wet with tears, and insisted upon presenting Saxe, with a very nasty-smelling cheese of her own make, the little party, journeyed back through the various valleys, and on to the lovely lake of, deep waters, where the mountains rose up like walls on either side, and, then on and on to Waldberg, whence they were to start next day for home.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and you may hear every Swiss mountaineer we meet do that.  You, hailed him, and the man answered, and he is coming toward us,\\\" continued, Dale, straining his eyes again to watch the slowly approaching figure., \\\"Bah!  How absurd!  I'm as bad as the sailor who put his cutlass into, his left hand, so that he could have his right free to knock an enemy, down with his fist.\\\"\\n\\nevidently meaning to land upon the projection he had occupied so long., But after several trials he found that he had not sufficient length of, rope for this, and he had to lower himself a little more, showing the, while the most implicit confidence in the rope as he began to swing, again, describing a larger and a larger arc, till he checked himself, when farthest distant from Saxe, upon a projection which just gave him, room enough to stand on a level with Saxe.\\n\\nHe was not long kept in doubt, for the party, whoever they were, came on, rapidly now, at the sight of the fire, the dim lanthorns dancing and, swinging about in the darkness below, and coming nearer and nearer, as, their bearers ascended the mountain side towards the patch of wood, till, all at once one of them came forward at a run into the light shed by the, fire.\\n\\nCertainly they seemed at liberty, for he threw them out so vigorously, that, as Saxe gazed at the hoofs playing about in the air, they seemed, to be sparring and fencing at him, while the tail between whipped and, whisked about, and ended by tucking itself in tightly, till Saxe sat, down on a rock roaring with laughter, when the mule suddenly ceased its, efforts, stood still, and turned its head round to watch him.\\n\\nHe was close upon it now, and, holding the light well up with his left, hand, he was in the act of turning the corner, when something moved out, of the darkness on the other side, and Saxe stood once more petrified, with horror as the light fell upon the huge face he had seen in the, night, but hideously distorted, and with the glowing bloodshot eyes, within six inches of his own.\\n\\nA good long look was taken at the various magnificent specimens before, they were laid together.  Then Melchior busied himself helping to, prepare the meal; and very shortly after this was ended, watching being, deemed unnecessary, the whole party were sleeping soundly, not one of, them, after the heavy toil of the day, being startled by the loud, squealing whinny given by the mule toward the middle of the night.\\n\\nand against this the whole body of water was propelled, to strike, straight upon it, and rise up like a billow of the sea and fall back, with a furious roar.  Here the foam formed so dense a mist that Dale had, crept right into it before he realised that, as the water fell back, it, shot away through the gloom to his left, forming a fresh billow against, a perpendicular wall before it again darted onward.\\n\\nand can show me how they are made of different stone, which is always, being ground down to come into the valleys to make them rich.  I know, all this, herr; and so I do not wonder and doubt when you ask me to show, you some of the wildest places in the mountains, where you may find, crystals and see glaciers and caves scarcely any of us have ventured to, search.  But if I told some of our people that you spend your money and, your time in seeking and examining all this, they would only laugh and, call me a fool.  They would say, `we know better.  He has blinded you., He is seeking for gold and diamonds.'  And I could not make them believe, it is all in the pursuit of--what do you call that!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is more than any one can understand, Saxe,\\\" said Dale quietly; \\\"and, yet, while it is grand beyond imagination, all the scheme of these, mountains, with their ice and snow, is gloriously simple.  Yes,\\\" he, added, with a nod to Melchior, \\\"go on,\\\" and an arduous climb followed, along the ridge of rocks, while the sun was reflected with a painful, glare from the snowfield on their left, a gloriously soft curve of, perhaps great depth kept from gliding down into the gorge below by the, ridge of rocks along which they climbed.\\n\\nThe way was safe enough, save here and there, when Melchior led them, along a ledge from which the slope down was so steep as to be almost a, precipice.  But here he always paused and drew in the rope till those in, his charge were close up to him; and on one of these occasions he patted, Saxe on the shoulder, for there had been a narrow piece of about fifty, feet in length that looked worse at a glance back than in the passing.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the boy shortly; and for the next hour they tramped over, snow like hailstones, and then zigzagged up a slope beyond it, where in, the steepest places a little cutting became necessary; but this was all, mastered in time, and the shoulder was reached, from which half a mile, away the final peak arose--a blunt hillock with perfectly smooth snow on, one side, bare rock, broken and rugged, on the other, while the snow at, the top seemed to have been cut clean off perpendicularly.\\n\\nThe meal, though, was not altogether pleasant to Saxe, who found that, every time he raised his eyes Pierre was staring at him in the peculiar, apathetic way which had irritated him so before.  No matter how he, changed his position, no matter what he did, the feeling was strong upon, him that old Andregg's servant was watching him; and the stronger this, idea grew upon him the more he felt compelled to turn and look back\\n\\n\\\"You wanted guides to the mountains, and we showed you the way, while, you taught us that we could climb too, and could be as cool and daring., We did not know it before, and we had to get over our suspicions.  For, we said, `these strangers must want to find something in the mountains--, something that will pay them for the risk they run in climbing up to the, places where the demons of the storm dwell, and who wait to hurl down, stones and dart lightning at the daring people who would venture up into, their homes.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I always feel, herrs, when I have had to do with an accident, that I, have been in fault, and that I have to examine myself as to what I had, left undone; but here I cannot see that I neglected anything.  The, crevasse was not wide.  I had seen you both leap in safety, and I, followed.  It was one of the misfortunes that happen to people, whether, they are mountaineers or quiet dwellers in the valley.\\\"\\n\\nThis time he got himself down lower, and his arms so far round Saxe that, he was able to hook his hands about his elbows.  Then, slowly bringing, his great strength to bear, he began to heave, the veins standing out, like network about his temples, and his face turning purple as he strove, to draw the prisoner out of the icy fetters in which he was fast.  But, for some moments every effort seemed to be vain, and a horrible feeling, of despair came over the guide as he relaxed his efforts once more.\\n\\n\\\"Saxifrages.  There are any number of them about here, from some so tiny, you can hardly see them to others with great bell flowers and broad, leaves.  I'm afraid if you went to the tropics Saxe, you would find, fault with the plants there, because you had seen so many of them at, home in England.  Now, let's sit down and rest here, and look at the, mountains!  I never tire of watching their snow peaks, ridges and, hollows, with their dazzling snow.\\\"\\n\\nThe snow was cold beneath him, and the sun poured down upon his back, with blistering power, but the boy felt nothing save the despairing, agony of mind; and as he lay there one desire, one wish came to his, mind, and that was full of longing for forgetfulness--the power to put, all this terrible trouble behind him--a miserable feeling of cowardice:, in short, of desire to evade his share of the cares of life, which come, to all: for he had yet to learn what is the whole duty of a man.\\n\\nThen onward slowly for hours--at times in the valley, where their feet, crushed the beautiful tufts of ferns; then the hoofs of the mule were, clattering over rounded masses of stone, ground and polished, over which, the patient beast slipped and slid, but never went down.  Now and then, there was a glimpse of a peak here or of another turning or rift there;, but for the most part they were completely shut in down between walls of, rock, which echoed their voices, bursting forth into quite an answering, chorus when Melchior gave forth a loud, melodious jodel.\\n\\nA pleasant, drowsy sensation began to steal over him, and he was about, to give way to it, when the idea came like a flash that it would be idle, and cowardly; and this thought made him spring up, and fold the rug in, which he had been rolled; and after a glance at where Mr Dale still, slept, he went softly out of the clump of trees in the direction where, he could hear the crackling, to find Melchior in the act of placing the, tin kettle they had brought upon the fire.\\n\\n\\\"The young herr shall see,\\\" replied the guide.  \\\"Ah! there is Andregg., The cows have just been brought home, and here come the goats.  I heard, the cry in the mountains.  We shall have bread and milk and cheese, if, we have nothing else.  Do I believe that about the demons who guard the, crystal caves?\\\" he continued thoughtfully.  \\\"Well, the young herr shall, see.  Hoi! hola, Andregg!  I bring you friends!\\\" he shouted to a, grey-haired man standing in the evening twilight, which was declining, fast, just outside the plain brown pine-wood chalet, with two women and, a boy leisurely milking cows and goats.\\n\\nlooking up at the rocky sides of the valley, which grew more and more, snow-clad as they went on, and giving himself greater trouble by missing, the footsteps of his leaders.  Once he nearly stumbled and fell, giving, a jerk to the rope; but he recovered himself directly, and tramped on in, silence, finding the going so arduous that he began to wish for the time, when they would leave the glacier and take to the rocks.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr.  How could man live up here in these solitudes?  It is bright, and beautiful now, with moss and dwarf firs and ferns; but food would, not grow here.  Then there is no grass for the cattle; and in the winter, it is all deep in snow, and the winds tear down these valleys, so that, it is only in sheltered places that the pines can stand.  Am I leading, the herrs right?  Is this the kind of scenery they wish to see?\\\"\\n\\nwhen he opened his eyes to find that he was the last to wake up, that, the fire was burning merrily, the sun shining, and nature looking more, beautiful than ever.  They were evidently waiting for him to wake and, join them, for the rough meal was spread and the party talking quietly--, all but Pierre, who lay on the ground upon his chest, resting his chin, in his hands, and staring hard in one direction with his heavy\\n\\nBut even this came to an end; for, refreshed by the food, and after, submitting to an examination by Melchior, who wished to make sure that, his feet were not frozen in the least, a peculiar sensation of drowsy, warmth came over the boy so strongly, that one minute he was trying to, paint his sufferings on the snow when he felt that he had lost Dale, the, next he was lying back wrapped in a blanket, breathing hard and sleeping, as soundly in that dwarf pine-wood on the ledge of the huge mountain as, if he had been back in London, with policemen regularly parading the, street outside.\\n\\nSaxe felt a catching sensation at the breast, a tingling in the temples, and cheeks, as if his veins were startled and his blood running wild;, and he stole his hand softly out from under the rug, to try and reach, his companions and rouse them to a sense of the impending danger--trying, to recollect at the same moment where the ice-axes had been placed when, they lay down overnight.\\n\\nIt had now become such a matter of course to rise at these nocturnal, hours for long expeditions, that Saxe turned out at once, with nothing, more than a growl or two and a vicious snatch at his clothes.  The cold, water and the coffee, however, soon set him right, and at two punctually, the trio were on their way along the valley, with the last quarter of, the moon to light them as they struck up close by the end of the lower, glacier, and then went on and on at a steady rate toward the great giant, whose pyramidal peak could be faintly discerned in the distance, looking, to Saxe terribly far off, and as if it would be impossible to reach the, top that day.  But their guide had cunning ways for shortening the, distance, leading them round this outer buttress, up that ravine, and in, and out and along shelves, so that, by the time the sun rose, they had, well mastered the outworks, and were ready to attack the peak itself.\\n\\nThe boy set his teeth, his brow furrowed, and there were marks about his, eyes, as he saw Dale throw the rope round the handle of the ice-axe, and, then over the coil, so that the rings of rope should come off freely., Then he grasped the hemp firmly with one hand, his ice-axe with the, other, and threw back his legs over the edge of the crevasse close to, where the great piece had broken away.  As he did this a piece of snow, slipped from under his chest, and went down before him and he was over, the side, swinging gently to and fro, as he heard a spattering noise, come from below.\\n\\nThis vast glacier had also shrunk, leaving from ten to twenty feet of, smoothly polished rock at the side--that is, at the foot of the, precipitous gorge down which it ran--and thus forming a comparatively, easy path for the travellers, who climbed upwards over the rounded, masses, stopping from time to time where the ice curved over, leaving, spaces between it and its rocky bed, down which Saxe gazed into a deep, blue dimness, and listened to the murmuring roar of many waters coursing, along beneath.\\n\\nThe effect of those falls was wonderful, and for the first few minutes, it seemed as if the water had just awakened at its various sources, and, was in no hurry to join the mad, impetuous stream below, so slowly it, dropped, turning into spray, which grew more and more misty as it, descended, while every now and then a jet as of silver rockets shot over, from the top, head and tail being exactly defined, but of course in, water instead of sparks.\\n\\nThe sun was now getting so low down that the great ragged pyramids and, crags of ice cast fantastic shadows eastward.  There was a deep orange, glow in the sky, and at another time they would have stopped enchanted, by the dazzling beauty of the effects before them; but now Saxe could, see nothing but the pale face of their guide, as he lay far below with, his staring eyes fixed upon the narrow rift beyond which was the evening, sky; and at such times as the boy conjured up this ghastly picture in, his brain, his eyes grew misty, and he stumbled and slipped upon the, rugged ice which formed their way.\\n\\n\\\"I can't make a fuss about it and complain,\\\" he said to himself: \\\"it, would seem to be so stupid.\\\"  For what could he say, save that the man, stared at him in a dull, heavy way?  Dale would reply that there was no, harm in that, and he would look weak.  But all the same the man's stare, worried him and spoiled his breakfast, making him feel irritable and, morose all the way back, till they reached Andregg's home in the valley\\n\\nwhich grew more and more rapid and delightful.  Every sense of weariness, was gone, and he was just thinking of lammergeyers in their flight, when, he heard his companions shouting to him, just as he lost his balance and, came down on his side.  Then, he lost his alpenstock and directly after, his temper, as he found he was rolling down head first till he gave, himself a tremendous wrench, and contrived to get his feet foremost\\n\\nherrs, which fits so well.  The mountains are here, and everlasting.  It, is nearly winter now, but the summer will come again, when the snows are, melting, and the valleys will be green and beautiful once more; and when, those bright days are here I shall see that the peaks are waiting to be, climbed and that there are perils to be bravely met by those who love, our land; and then I shall pray.  Herr Dale, that you will come again\\n\\nMelchior stepped at once on to the ledge, and the others followed, all, three going cautiously and very slowly through the opaque mist, which, looked so solid at Saxe's feet that more than once he was ready to make, a false step, while he wondered in himself that he did not feel more, alarm, but attributed the cause rightly to the fact that he could not, see the danger yawning below.  To make the passage along this ledge the, more perilous and strange, each was invisible to the other, and their, voices in the awful solitude sounded muffled and strange.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, up there now.  I have often known men ascend mountains on what, seemed to be glorious days, and there was only a fine filmy veil to be, seen floating round the higher parts--just enough to hide them perhaps, for an hour together; but when they came down to the little hotel in the, valley, they had a long tale to tell us of having been frostbitten while, clinging to the snow slopes and ice-covered rocks, not daring to venture, up or down on account of the tremendous, tempestuous wind blowing.\\\"\\n\\nThey could see for a couple of hundred yards down the narrow way along, which the stream ran; then it bore off to the right and was hidden; and, to command a better view, as they eagerly searched the surface for some, trace of Melchior, they mounted the tumbled-together rocks, and saw that, they were at the head of a widening valley, surrounded by nearly level, mountains, forming an oval, which looked like the bed of an ancient lake, similar to the one they had lately left.  But, in place of deep water\\n\\n\\\"All right, Saxe,\\\" he said, as he rested one foot on a tiny boss; \\\"I, shall do it now.\\\"  Then, helping himself by the double rope for hold, he, climbed up the few feet between him and the projection, making use of, every little crevice or angle for his feet, till he was able to get one, arm right over the little block and hold on while he drew up the loop\\n\\nThen came a couple of hours' toilsome climb over broken stones, and up, masses that were mastered by sheer scrambling.  Now and then an easy, rock slope presented itself, or a gully between two buttresses of the, mountain, as they won their way higher and higher.  Only once was there, a really dangerous place--a mere ledge, such as they had passed along on, the previous day, but instead of a raging torrent beneath them there was, a wall of nearly perpendicular rock running down for about a thousand, feet to a great bed of snow.\\n\\nThey climbed over some awkward rocks and joined him, to find that a, dismal chasm of great depth went off here at a sharp angle; and some, little distance down one of its rugged walls he pointed out a dark, opening which seemed unapproachable at first, though a little further, examination showed that it was quite possible for a cool-headed man to, get down--one who would not think of the dark depths below.\\n\\n\\\"`Morgen!'  Well, that's `good morning.'  He must understand that; but I, don't believe he understands it as we do when one says `good morning' to, a fellow and means he's to go.  Oh!  I say, what are you following me, for?  I know.  He is a dirty-looking beggar.  He's coming for a wash., But after me, please, mein herr.  I'll have first go.  Ugh!  I'd rather, have a bath after a pig.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I don't want to hurry,\\\" muttered Saxe, as he began to glide down, the beautiful sloping curve, with the crisp large-grained snow hissing, and flying down before him.  It was glorious.  He felt as if he were, flying; then as if he were having a splendid skate without the slightest, exertion.  The bottom of the valley began to fly up to meet him, and he, had some slight consciousness of Dale being close before or behind him\\n\\nHe got himself into position as he spoke, but had to use the spike at, the end of his axe handle to form a place for his feet on either side., Then, throwing down the axe, he planted his feet firmly, bent down, nearly double, clasped his hands round the boy, and after seeing that he, had a good grip of the ashen handle above his head, called upon him to, heave.\\n\\nAnd now he found that he still held the ice-axe that had been his, companion all day.  It was stretched right out above him as far as he, could reach, and, as he moved it, to his intense joy he could see a pale, ray of light, one which increased as he moved the axe again, telling him, that, though he was buried, the head of the axe was above the level of, the snow.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly, Melchior,\\\" cried Dale.  \\\"That proves what I say.  This huge, mass of granite must have fallen from the Domberg on to the glacier, which once filled this limestone valley, and have been gradually carried, down and left here.  Such a glacier as the one which polished all these, rocks could easily have brought down that block; and when in bygone ages, the ice melted, this block was left here.  I dare say we shall find more, like it.\\\"\\n\\nIf the goat did hear, it paid no heed, but went on; and as the way, seemed to be safe in the dim blue light, Saxe followed, till from, twilight it began to grow purply-black before he had nearly overtaken, the goat, which uttered a mournful baa, and stopped short, as a, good-sized lump of ice flew by its head, and smashed upon the rock; and, as the goat still advanced, another and another came flying.\\n\\n\\\"You are quite wrong,\\\" replied Saxe, and he repeated all that Dale had, said; but the guide did not seem to be satisfied, for he shook his head, solemnly, and went about smoking his big pipe, looking despondent in the, extreme; while the others spent the morning chipping the stones in, search of minerals that might prove interesting, and of the various, Alpine plants that luxuriated in the sheltered corners and ravines, facing the south.\\n\\nSaxe said no more, for at that moment a rush of snow swept by them as if, borne upon the wings of some terrible tempest, and in the midst of the, suffocating sensation he felt himself sinking lower and lower.  The snow, was at his waist; then, as he was borne swiftly down, at his breast; and, the next instant at his lips; and all the while he was gliding downward, at railway speed.\\n\\nSaxe went off rather dissatisfied, towel in hand, to pass their, landlord's wife and receive a nod and smile.  Then he went on towards, the place which he had visited before; and now, one by one, the, cold-looking peaks began to turn rosy and brighten, the scene changing, so rapidly to orange and gold that Saxe forgot his dissatisfied, feelings, and at last stopped to look round in admiration, then in, dismay, and at last in something approaching rage; for not a dozen yards, behind him was the heavy, stolid face of Pierre, his mouth looking as if, it had not been shut since he spoke to him.\\n\\nIt took a long time to find that bubbling spring; but they discovered it, at last, coming down from hundreds of feet above their heads, over vivid, green moss and under fern fronds, to form into tiny pools in the, crevices of the rocks; and from one of these they drank with avidity, long cooling draughts of the sparkling water dipped out in the flask, cup, and then they turned to go.\\n\\nBut it was a glorious time, in spite of the disappointment, and Saxe, revelled in the wondrous scenery, growing more sure-footed and firm of, nerve day by day when in the mountains, and happy and full of fun when, back in Andregg's valley, leaving the donkey or his companion Gros, and, accompanying heavy, surly, stupid, strong Pierre up the green alps to, fetch home the goats and cows, becoming a perfect adept with a great, wooden Alpine horn, whose notes evoked wonderful echoes among the, mountains which shut them in.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!  I do wish I had paid more attention to my jolly old French and, German at school,\\\" muttered Saxe, as the man's stare quite worried him., \\\"I wonder what `be off' is?  Allez-vous en he would not understand., `Gehen!'  That's `to go.'  But you can't say `to go' to a fellow, when, you want him to be off.  And you can't say `go to,' because gehen's only, one word.  I know: `Gehen sie Jericho!'  I'll let that off at him if he, follows me any farther.\\\"\\n\\nSaxe kept his word, and he slept soundly, only waking once when the mule, uttered one of its peculiar squeals.  But no one was sufficiently, alarmed to get up, and the incident was forgotten next morning, when one, of many days of an uneventful nature commenced, during which the party, made excursions in different directions: into the ice grotto; across the, glacier to the Bergstock; up to first one and then another snowfield\\n\\nThey climbed on, but the difficulties increased, and there proved to be, an awkward ice ledge to pass along, with a terrific gulf beneath; and a, gap or two, with snow bridges, which were apparently waiting a touch to, go down at once.  These were all safely overcome.  And at last a long, slope of loose snow was all that remained to toil up before they reached, the top, where Saxe threw himself down to enjoy the wondrous prospect of, glittering ice peaks, and, a few minutes after, the food Melchior, brought from his wallet.\\n\\n\\\"Now you are laughing at me,\\\" said Saxe resentfully.  \\\"No: I am in, earnest.  Take a look round, boy, and then we'll go up the ravine and, satisfy ourselves that it is all safe, and come back after a quiet, investigation, so as to see whether there are other ways of fixing our, rope.  I should like to go up higher, too, and try whether we cannot get, out on to the mountain, as I at first proposed.\\\"\\n\\nFor a few moments Dale and Saxe knelt together there, with their hearts, throbbing wildly at their discovery.  There was a bewildering train of, thoughts, too, running through their minds, as to how the poor fellow, could have got there; and Saxe could only find bottom in one idea--that, they had been confusedly wandering about, returning another way, till, they had accidentally hit upon a further development of the great, crevasse into which the guide had fallen.\\n\\n\\\"They must have been carried farther,\\\" he tried to think; \\\"and as soon, as they can climb up they will begin to seek for me;\\\" and he repeated, this cheering thought to fight back another, which was vague, strange, and terrible--a thought which suggested the impossibility of two people, discovering the tiny hole made by the head of an ice-axe in the midst of, the snow of that tremendous avalanche.\\n\\nIt was all plain enough now.  The weight of the two who had first leaped, must have cracked a portion of the edge of the crevasse--a part rotten, from long exposure to the sun, rain and frost.  Then Melchior must have, sprung over, the great triangular piece had given way, he had made a, desperate attempt to save himself with his axe, but that had not struck, home, and he had gone down with the mass of ice and snow, the echoing, crash and boom having drowned any cry he might have uttered, even if he, had time to call for help.\\n\\n\\\"It seems strange to you English gentlemen; but you come from great, cities where people are many, and you can hardly count your friends., Out here in the deep thals, where men are shut up by the snow for weeks, together, with only their cows and mules and goats, they grow to look, upon the animals about them as friends, just as the poor animals, themselves look to their masters for their care, and run to them for, help and shelter when the great storms come down.  Why, herr, you have, seen they live in part of the house.  The chalet is built up with a warm, shelter beneath for the little flock or herd.  Poor Gros!  Andregg will, nearly break his heart; and,\\\" added the guide simply, \\\"he will not even, have the consolation of saving the skin.\\\"\\n\\nBut there was the possibility of the unfortunate man being thrown into, one of the vast pot-holes or cauldrons formed cavern-like in bends of, the chasm, where as it rushed along past the zigzag of the broken rock, the water glanced from one side, and shot almost at right angles across, to the other, to whirl round and round, ever enlarging a great well-like, hole, the centre of which looked like a funnel-like whirlpool, with the, water screwing its way apparently into the bowels of the earth, and down, whose watery throat great balls of foam were constantly being sucked.\\n\\nIt was slow work for a few minutes, till the path rose once more, and, then they progressed pretty quickly till the shelf ran down again; and, as Saxe went on through the gloom, feeling that the rope was kept fairly, taut, another sharp bend was turned, and they came in view of the facing, wall of rock, against which the stream rushed and rose up now in such a, body that Melchior raised his voice loudly:\\n\\nHe looked up to right and left at the walls of black rock growing higher, the farther they went, and now quite made up his mind that there would, be no exit from the gorge; but all the same, it had a peculiar, fascination for both, from its seeming to be a place where the foot of, man had never before trod, and the possibility of their making some, discovery deep in among the black rocks of the weird chasm.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not laughing at you, Saxe, my boy: only saying a word to cheer you, up.  You haven't got a crevasse under you, and if the worst came I, should have to catch you.  Now, let's see: here's a ledge away to your, right; but it's too far for you to leap, and there is nothing to catch, hold of.  If I got the rope up to you, you could fasten it somewhere and, slide down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say nothing, herr.  What can a man who knows the mountains say, but, that this is a place of change?  Down here in the valley it has been a, soft bright summer day, whilst up yonder in the mountains storm and snow, have raged, and the icy winds have frozen men to death.  Another day I, have left the wind howling and the rain beating and the great black, clouds hanging low; and in an hour or two I have climbed up to sunshine\\n\\nWhat followed was blind confusion, in which Saxe struggled to fight back, the snow, so that he could breathe, for the sense of suffocation was, terrible.  Then all at once the rapid gliding motion ceased, and in the, darkness he felt as if he were being held tightly in some terrible, embrace, which closed round him slowly and surely, till only his arms, were at liberty, and with these he fought.\\n\\n\\\"What can he be doing?\\\" thought Saxe sleepily.  \\\"I don't know.  It must, be packing up for our start.  Let's see, when will Melchior be back?, This morning, I suppose.  Wish he was here now to light the fire.  He's, so used to it--he does it so well; and then, he always makes such, delicious coffee, that I enjoy my breakfast far better than when we make, it ourselves, or Mr Dale makes it, and--Yes, all right!\\\"\\n\\nRight and left were the silvery veil-like cascades: down below them some, five hundred feet the little river roared and boomed, and the junction, of the silvery water of the falls with the grey milky, churned-up foam, of the torrent was plainly seen in two cases.  But the sight which, enchained Saxe's attention was the head of the valley up which they had, toiled, filled by what at the first glance seemed to be a huge cascade, descending and flowing along the ravine before him, but which soon, resolved itself into the first glacier--a wonderfully beautiful frozen, river, rugged, wild and vast, but singularly free from the fallen stones, and earth which usually rob these wonders of their beauty, and looking, now in the bright sunshine dazzling in its purity of white, shaded by, rift, crack and hollow, where the compressed snow was of the most, delicate sapphire tint.\\n\\nand, stretching out my ice-axe, I felt about till I could hook it on to, ice or stone; and as I drew myself along by the handle the water grew, less deep, then shallower still; and as I made my way it was over stones, among which water ran, and I felt about with my axe, puzzled, for it was, so strange.  There was the water running over my feet, but gently, and, the rushing river a little way behind.  What did it mean? why was it so?, Those were the questions I asked myself till the light came.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will be very useful to us, herr, and save us many a long weary, tramp,\\\" said the guide, smiling.  \\\"I am willing and strong, but I cannot, guide and carry much as well, and if you share the load with me, your, climbing will be too laborious.  With the mule to drive before us, we, can take water, food, and blankets, beside a kettle for coffee; and, sleep for one, two or three nights in the mountains, if we like.  Shall, we take him to-day?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A little, herr,\\\" said the guide, smiling--\\\"not a great deal.  It is, beyond us.  We know by the clouds and mists high above the mountains, when it is safe to go and when to stay; for if we see long-drawn and, rugged clouds hanging about the points and trailing down the cols and, over each icy grat, we know there is a tempest raging and we do not go., There is not much wisdom in that.  It is very simple, and--Look! the, young herr is fast asleep.  Poor boy!--it has been a tiring day.  Shall, we go to rest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look! look!\\\" yelled Saxe, as the mule's head shot up in the shadow, thirty or forty feet farther in, so swift was the current.  Then up came, its forelegs, and it began to paw the water like a drowning dog, just as, Melchior rose to the surface, but only in time to receive the hoofs of, the struggling mule on his chest, and he disappeared again, while the, water rolled the mule over and down out of sight.\\n\\nHe set the example, flinging himself upon his face and extending his, hands above his head, as a whizzing sound was heard; then a dull thud or, two and directly after there was a crash on the rocky side of the, couloir a few feet above their heads, followed by a shower of slaty, fragments which fell upon them, while a great fragment, which had become, detached far above, glanced off, struck the other side of the gully, and, then went downward, ploughing up the snow.\\n\\nA tense tale, such as we expect of George Manville Fenn.  A group of, English people are in the Swiss Alps.  But it is not just the beauties, of the scenery they are after, but crystals which may sometimes be, found in caves near the top of the glaciers.  They manage to find a, guide who promises to be discreet about what they do.  But someone else, is on the mountain, and he is just as interested in what they are up to\\n\\n\\\"We can get down here, herr,\\\" he said; and, setting the example, he, descended nimbly from ledge to ledge, pausing at any difficult place to, lend a hand or point out foothold, till they were half-way down, when, the ledges and crevices by which they had descended suddenly ceased, and, they stood upon a shelf from which there seemed to be no further, progression, till, as if guided by the formation, Melchior crept to the, very end, peered round an angle of the rock, and then came back.\\n\\nThey relapsed into silence again, and it was growing so dusk when they, began to climb up out of the glacier valley, that the reflection of a, fire could be seen upon the side of the rocky niche in which they had, formed their camp; and later on, as they came in sight of the little, fall at the end of the rift in the mountain, the foaming waters were lit, up so brilliantly that they looked like gold.\\n\\n\\\"Tell any curious people that we are making ascents because I am, studying the mountains.  It will be the truth; for, understand me, I am, not going alone for this search.  I want to find out more concerning the, forming of the glaciers, and the gathering of storms on the mountains., There are endless discoveries to be made, and ascents to be attempted., You will show me mountains that have not yet been climbed.\\\"\\n\\nBut this part of his suffering had its termination; and he fully grasped, that, like as in a dream, all this had occupied but a few moments of, time, for a hand was thrust round the stony angle and searched for a, projection, and as Dale eagerly grasped the humid palm, Saxe glided, round and then followed him into the corner, beneath which the water, roared and churned itself into foam, passed this in safety, and once, more they crept on, thinking now only of getting out into the daylight, and following the stream in the hope of finding poor Melchior's remains.\\n\\nHow long he stood bent forward there gazing at that horrible head Saxe, did not know, but by degrees he began to shrink back slowly, getting, farther and farther away, till he dared to turn and run with all his, might to the tent door, and creep in, fully expecting that the monster, was about to spring upon him till he was inside, when he fastened the, canvas door with trembling fingers, and crept to his bed again, where he, lay down quickly, with his breath sobbing and the perspiration standing, in great drops upon his face.  The sensation was upon him that the, terrible being he had seen would begin breaking in through the canvas, directly, and he lay there with one arm stretched out ready to wake up, Dale for help at the first sound outside the tent.\\n\\nSaxe had forgotten the incident in the conversation which ensued; and, after the discussion of the plans for the ensuing day, he went to his, sleeping-place to think about the blue-ice grotto at the bottom of the, glacier where the milky stream issued, and lie wondering how far up they, would be able to explore it, and whether it would be possible to get up, as far as the crevasse out of which they had rescued the guide.\\n\\nThen there was a long silence, during which Saxe, as if doubting that, the guide was right, carefully examined the walls of the chasm, but, always with the same result: he could see rifts and places in plenty, where he could have climbed high enough to be beyond reach of the water, even if it rose thirty or forty feet; but they were all on the other, side, which was slightly convex, while their side, as the guide had, pointed out, was concave, and would have matched exactly if the sides, had been driven together.\\n\\n\\\"After awhile, herr, after awhile.  When we get to the end of this thal, we shall come upon a larger lake.  We shall go along one shore of that, to where it empties itself.  There is much water in it, for three, glaciers run down toward it.  At the other end, beyond the schlucht, we, shall be in the greater valley, between the mountains I pointed to this, morning; and there you will find steeper places than this, wilder and, stranger, where we can camp for to-night, and to-morrow you can choose.\\\"\\n\\nand his desire was intense to begin questioning; but he restrained, himself, waiting till Melchior himself should begin, and following down, over the rugged and slippery stones for what seemed to be a weary, interminable time.  A dozen times over the boy felt as if, regardless of, the cold, and the knowledge that it was freezing sharply, he must throw, himself down and sleep.  But there was the dark figure of the patient, guide before him, struggling slowly along, and fighting against the pain, and exhaustion that nearly overcame him, and he took heart and stumbled, on till he felt as if all the trouble through which he had passed that, evening were a dream, of which this was the nightmare-like following\\n\\n\\\"I wonder what they are all doing now?\\\" he thought.  \\\"Asleep, of course., I don't believe my mother would sleep comfortably, though, if she knew, I was lying out here like this, with no bed-curtains and the snow just, over us.  It is rum, though--summer and winter all muddled up together, so closely that you stand with your right leg in July, picking flowers, and catching butterflies, and the left leg in January, so that you can, turn over and make a snowball or pick icicles off the rocks.\\\"\\n\\nHe lay down once more in the snow, shrinkingly, for in spite of his, efforts, the thought would come, \\\"Suppose a great piece of the side, should give way beneath me, and carry me down to a similar fate to, Melchior's.\\\"  These fancies made him move carefully in his efforts to, peer down farther than before, so as to force his eyes to pierce the, gloom and make out where Melchior lay.\\n\\nSaxe's sleep was almost dreamless till toward morning, when he became a, little restless consequent upon imagining that he was engaged in a, desperate encounter with a small round goblin, who was about the size of, a baby, but seemed to have the strength of an elephant.  He walked in at, the tent door, and informed Saxe that he had come to fetch the crystals, stolen from his storehouse that day; and upon Saxe refusing to give them, up, a desperate encounter took place--a fight which had no beginning and, no end, finishing off, as it were, in a mist, out of which he started to, hear the sound of wood crackling, and to find that it was day.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, to try,\\\" said Dale sadly.  \\\"Oh, but it is maddening just as, success had attended us!\\\" and he relapsed into gloomy silence, as, Melchior went about the grotto holding the lanthorn to its glittering, ceiling, the light flashing from hundreds of crystals; but every one, worth taking as a specimen had been removed, and a great rusty hammer, with which they had been broken off lay before them, forgotten in their, hurry by those who had been there.\\n\\nThey started again, and Saxe felt his heart beat heavily as the water, rose to his knees and he could feel its soft strong push against him;, but he forgot all this the next moment, on hearing Melchior give vent to, his feelings in a long, loud jodel, which sounded strange enough in the, awful rift, with an accompaniment of the noise of rushing waters, but, not half so strange as the curious whinnying half-squeal, half-neigh\\n\\nherr; but if we have to make for the lower end of the schlucht, try and, remember this: Don't struggle to get to the surface, for it is waste of, strength.  You cannot swim properly in this water, for all torrents are, full of bubbles of air, and these do not bear one up like still water., What you must do is, to get a fresh breath now and then, and let the, stream carry you along.\\\"\\n\\nThe mule hesitated.  The water was right over the track here, and the, animal bent down, sniffed and pawed at it as if uneasy; but a few more, words from Melchior made it go on a few steps very slowly, and, continually trying its way, so as to get a good foothold before going, on, and acting in a wonderfully human way by pressing itself very close, to the rock.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, herr, in the name of the canton.  But they will not be ungenerous., They will like good specimens for our museums; but they will let Herr, Dale choose and take what he wishes to his own country.  It is for, science, and we Swiss are as proud to welcome all scientific men to, explore our country as we are to serve those who merely come to admire, and return again and again, to see the mountains, glaciers and lakes of, our dear fatherland.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was quite time, poor lad,\\\" muttered Melchior.  \\\"The warmth from my, body will keep him alive, and, Heaven helping me, I may get safely down, below the snow.  If I can do that, I must find a place where I can make, a fire.  Now, lad, you call yourself a guide: make for the nearest bit, of forest, and save this poor boy's life.  But it's a hard task--a hard, task, and you need all your strength and knowledge now.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped short, colouring a little; and at that moment he turned, sharply, for there was a loud sneeze from below, and directly after a, youngish man, with a lowering look and some bits of hay sticking in his, hair, came out from the cowhouse and slouched by the front, glancing up, with half-shut eyes towards the occupants of the verandah, on his way to, a low stone-built shingle-roofed place, from which sundry bleatings told, that it was the refuge of the herd of goats.\\n\\nas he prepared in turn to descend, for in spite of the confidence given, by the rope about his chest, he found himself fancying that if the knot, came undone by the jerk he should give it if he slipped from one of, those awkward pieces of stone, he would go on falling and bounding from, rock to rock till he lay bruised and cut, perhaps killed, at the bottom, of the mountain.\\n\\nAll fell out as Melchior had foretold.  Pierre and his follower soon, returned with the tent, and humbly accepted some food before loading the, mule, and then themselves, with some of the choicest crystals, which, were deposited safely in Andregg's chalet.  The next day they made a, journey with the two animals alone, and brought back more; and again on, the following day they set off and brought the rest, Andregg gazing with, astonishment at the magnificent collection.\\n\\nHe stooped and picked up a stone as big as his fists, and suddenly, became aware of the fact that, though the mule's head was turned away, from him, the cunning animal turned its eyes back and was watching him, carefully.  For as he raised the stone Gros shook his head so that his, long ears rattled, squealed, and a peculiar quivering motion, like the, beginning of a dance, was visible in his hind quarters.\\n\\n\\\"He has got it,\\\" muttered Saxe, after a painful pause; and then they, heard the clink of the ice against the lanthorn, and saw the latter, move, while directly after, from out of the silence below, there came, the sound of a deeply drawn breath.  \\\"Can you hold on there?\\\" said Dale, then, sharply.  \\\"A little while, herr.  I am cold, but hope will put, life in me.\\\"  Dale waited a few minutes, and Saxe touched him, imploringly.  \\\"What shall we do?\\\" he whispered.  \\\"Shall I go for help?\\\"\\n\\nTo his surprise, as they descended they found Gros on his back, in a, gully full of sand and stones, snorting, flapping his ears and throwing, up his legs, as he fell over first on one side, then on the other, in, the full enjoyment of a good roll; while as they advanced it was to find, Melchior in the sheltered nook setting up the tent, after rolling some, huge pieces of rock to the four corners ready to secure the ropes; for, there was no spot in that stony ravine where a peg of iron, let alone, one of wood, could be driven in.\\n\\n\\\"It's no good to stop thinking about it,\\\" he muttered; and lowering, himself down, he began to descend steadily, with the feeling of dread, passing off directly he had started; for the excitement of the work, and, the energy that he had to bring to bear in lowering himself from ledge, to ledge, kept him too busy to think of anything but the task in hand;, so that, in what seemed to be an incredibly short space of time, he was, standing beside Dale.\\n\\nFor, as Pierre afterwards confessed, he had heard the plans made as he, stood, on their first coming, in the stable, and then and there, determined to possess himself of the valuable specimens the English, party and their guide might find.  In spite of his vacant look, he was, possessed of plenty of low cunning, and he at once secured the dog-like, services of the cretin, who had been his companion in the mountains for, years, and obeyed him with the dumb fidelity of a slave.\\n\\nThey went on for the next two hours in silence, while the pass they were, following grew more and more wild, but it opened out a little during the, next hour, but only to contract again.  And here, in a secluded place, beneath one of the vast walls of rock which shut them in, and beside a, tiny rivulet which came bubbling and foaming down, the guide suggested a, short halt and refreshment.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps not if he was very hungry,\\\" he thought, after a few minutes., \\\"But I do wish I could feel brave, like men do, and not turn shaky and, queer at the least thing.  Here was I imagining all that rubbish just, because I heard a stick broken by old Melchior to make the fire., Yesterday all I had to do was to walk along a shelf of rock, with some, water running down below me.  If it had been out in the open sunshine I, shouldn't have minded a bit; but because it was a little dark I fancied, all sorts of stuff.  Of course it was a bit startling to see a fellow go, head over heels into a torrent along with a moke and be swept away; but, I don't believe old Melk was half so much frightened as I was.\\\"\\n\\nHere the mule was unloaded by a shabby amount of pasture, ice-axes and, hammers seized, and the trio started over the level bed of the glacier, streams, the main rivulet dividing into several tiny veins, which spread, over the soft clayey earth brought down by the water.  But this soon, gave place to rock as they neared the piled-up ice, which looked to Saxe, like huge masses of dull white chalk, veined in every direction with, blue.\\n\\nSaxe glanced down as they passed the angles and gradually entered the, semi-darkness, and saw that the surface of the water was smoother, and, that, as they passed the waves formed by the water being hurled against, the opposing faces of the rock, there was less foam and turmoil; but, these places looked, if anything, more terrible than before, and the, water, as it surged up so much nearer his feet, looked to his excited, vision as if stealthily writhing towards him to lap round his legs like, some huge serpent, and snatch him down into the depths.\\n\\nSaxe nodded, and wishing fervently for the guide's strength, he toiled, on again behind him, till at last they stood upon the bare rock swept, clear of the snow, and any doubt of its being where the mishap befel, them was quite removed by their coming suddenly upon quite a wall of, snow standing many feet above their heads, and running far enough to, right and left in a jagged line, as if a flash of lightning had darted, across and made the division.\\n\\nthanking Providence that he was below all the parts which necessitated, clinging; and at last, when so utterly wearied out that his pace was a, mere crawl, he reached the pines, threaded his way in, and lowered Saxe, down.  Then, setting rapidly to work, he soon brought together a, quantity of dead wood, and started a fire with a few handfuls of pine, needles piled on the small boughs to shed its warmth upon the boy's, half-frozen feet.\\n\\nAt the moment they stepped on to the green stunted pasture, dotted with, flowers, the roar of the torrent came up from a gash in the rocks far, below, and to right and left, from at least three hundred feet up, the, waters of no less than five streams glided softly over the rocks, and, fell slowly in silvery foam, to form so many tributaries of the torrent, far below.\\n\\ntill, the sensation of thirst growing more acute, he went on, with the, towering wall of rock to right and left, and the moist odour of the, falling water saluting his nostrils, as he went close up to where one, tiny thread of water fell bubbling into a rocky basin, edged with moss--, the spot where water was obtained for regular use, its crystal purity, tempting the thirsty to drink.\\n\\n\\\"And then I took my axe again as it lay beside me, and began cutting in, a madly foolish kind of way.  There was no use in it.  I could not help, myself by cutting; but I could hear the lumps of ice hissing down, and, it made me think, so that the work did me good.  More, it did other, good, for, as I have thought over it since, it has made me try to pray, as a man should pray who has been delivered from a terrible fall.  For, those last blows of my axe must have been the ones which you heard, Herr, Saxe--the blows which brought you to my help just when my arms were, ready to sink to my side, and I had fully determined in my own mind that, I could never get down from the ledge to the little river alive.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, herr,\\\" said Melchior quietly; and thrusting the hammer handle, and the chisel through his belt, he went up and along the ledge with, wonderful agility, sprang across on to the projecting block, and then, Saxe watched him eagerly as he saw him drive in the point of the, geological hammer as high up as he could reach, and use it to hold by, while he climbed higher and got his feet on the lower edge of the, opening, where he stood with his hand inside to steady himself while he, wriggled out the hammer.  Then, holding this in his breast, they saw him, take a steel spike from his pocket, and after a little examination, thrust the point in a crevice which looked like an upward continuation, of the opening into the grotto.  This done, a sharp stroke or two from, the hammer enabled him to fix the spike sufficiently firmly to enable, him to hold on by it with his left hand while he drove it in firmly with, the hammer before passing the double rope over it, and making a sling in, which he could sit opposite the opening and work.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that!  Yes, herr.  Our people are curious.  Years ago we used to go, on quietly tending our cows and goats in the valleys, and driving them, up to the huts on the mountains when the snow melted.  There were the, great stocks and horns and spitzes towering up, covered with eternal, snow, and we gazed at them with awe.  Then you Englishmen came, and, wanted to go up and up where the foot of man never before stepped; and, even our most daring chamois hunters watched you all with wonder.\\\"\\n\\ncreeping cautiously in and out among the stones, till it reached one of, the many ledges of a precipice, and trotted along toward the edge of the, lateral valley, over which it peered cautiously, and then drew back and, went higher, repeating the action several times, and in the distance, looking more and more bearlike in its movements, only that there was, this difference, that instead of the travellers stalking the bear, the, animal seemed to be bent on stalking them.\\n\\nHe crept back to the crevasse, and listened and shouted again, to begin, wondering once more how deep the chasm would be; and at last, with the, horror of being alone there in that awful solitude creeping over him, he, felt that he must do something, and, catching up his ice-axe from where, it lay, he tramped away fifty yards to where a cluster of ragged, pinnacles of ice hung together, and with a few blows from the pick-end, of the axe he broke off a couple of fragments as big as his head, and, then bounded back.\\n\\nSaxe stood there with the shrinking sensation increasing, and it was, some time before he could rouse himself sufficiently to carry out his, first intention and throw the second piece of ice into the gulf.  As it, fell his heart beat heavily, and he once more dropped upon his hands and, knees to follow its downward course and watch the comparatively slow and, beautiful changes through which it passed before it disappeared in the, purply-black darkness, while he listened for the crash as it broke upon, the ledge preparatory to waiting in silence for the fall of the, fragments lower down.\\n\\nThen a ledge of ice had to be cautiously approached and passed, one, angle where there was barely foothold calling for all Saxe's fortitude;, but he passed it bravely and fought very hard not to show that he had, felt a slight attack of nerves.  There had been a curious catching, sensation in his throat, and his breath had come as he glanced once down, into the blue haze in an ice gulf; but he breathed more freely as firm, snow and then solid rock was reached; and the descent continued, no, allusion being made to the perilous bit, though on glancing at the guide, once he received a nod which evidently meant:\\n\\n\\\"Terribly, herr,\\\" said the guide.  \\\"And you laugh.  I don't wonder.  But, there are plenty of our simple, uneducated people in the villages who, believe all that still.  I heard it all as a child, and it took a great, deal of quiet thinking, as I grew up, before I could shake off all those, follies, and see that there was nothing to fear high up, but the ice and, wind and snow, with the dangers of the climbing.  Why, fifty years ago\\n\\nThe mountain side proving the easier, as the stones in the bottom grew, more massive and difficult to climb, the boy took to the slope, and made, such rapid progress that Dale was left behind; and he was about to shout, to Saxe not to hurry, when he saw that the boy was waiting some eighty, or ninety yards in advance, and high up above the bottom of the gorge, along which Dale had proceeded in a slower and surer way.\\n\\n\\\"Pert, but smart, Saxe,\\\" he said.  \\\"Seriously, though, a mountain, climber, who must naturally be often walking along risky places, has, enough to think about without indulging in fancies of what might be if, this happened or that took place.  Such thoughts may unnerve him; and, you may depend upon it, some of the bravest things are done by those who, think the least.  I remember, one day in London, seeing the men taking, down one of those vast scaffolds formed, not of poles, but of square, timbers bolted together; and I saw one man, about a hundred and fifty, feet from the ground, standing on one of these pieces of timber, which, was fastened to an upright at each end.  He was looking on while another, workman unscrewed one of the bolts which held it.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a heavy tug, and as some more snow rattled down into the gulf, Saxe was drawn over the edge on to the surface, where the first thing he, noticed was the fact that the other end of the rope had been fastened, round Dale's waist and passed round the ashen handle, so that when Dale, had lain down he had been able to support Saxe, and yet leave his hands, free.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; and nobody is going to fall.  You are fancying troubles.  I, know.  I have not led strangers up the mountains for twenty years, without studying their faces as well as the face of Nature.  I can read, yours.  You are scarcely yourself, and feeling fear where there is no, need.  Come now, take a long breath.  Make an effort, and be calm.  I'll, draw up the rope and fasten one end round you, and lower you down.\\\"\\n\\nanchoring it by means of its lines to stones, as soft a spot as could be, found having been selected, for they were far above the pines, and the, prospect of getting anything suitable for a bed was very small--even, moss proving scarce.  However, a rug spread beneath them saved them from, some of the asperities of the rocky ground, and after they had partaken, of their evening meal and taken a short peep round the huge hollow\\n\\nIt was not a very satisfactory place for running, encumbered as it was, with stones; but Saxe was as active as most lads of his age, and he, started off dodging in and out among huge blocks of granite, leaping, from smooth glacier ground rock to rock, making good speed over the, patches of level grass and whin, and sending the blood coursing through, his veins in the bright morning air; but to his intense annoyance he, found that his activity was nothing to that of the heavy, dirty-looking, being who kept up easily close to his heels, for every now and then the, man leaped from rock to rock as surely as a goat.  But growing a little, out of breath, and thinking at last that it was of no use to tire, himself so soon in the morning, the boy slowly settled down into a walk, just as a loud jodel came echoing from the sheltered hollow where the, chalet stood.\\n\\nHow he got out of that place he did not know; but soon after his eyes, were aching with the glare of the snow around him.  A huge eagle, a, hundred times bigger than the one he had seen, was soaring round and, round, and coming lower and lower, till it was so close to him that he, could feel the wind of its wings wafted pleasantly over his face.  The, bird's back was soft and cushiony, and it seemed to be inviting him to, take his place upon it for a ride up in the air; and he was thinking of, doing so, and gliding off over the silver-topped mountains to look out, for caves where they could chip out crystals, and perhaps discover, valuable metals; but just as he was about to throw a leg over the, feathery saddle and take his seat, there was a fearful yell, that, sounded like an accident in a trombone manufactory, where all the, instruments had been blown up by an explosion of steam.  He was hurled, back upon the snow, and held down by some monstrous creature, which, planted its feet upon his chest; and the people buried in the snow began, to moan more loudly and ring the bells.\\n\\nThe chasm had made another turn, and as Saxe spoke he climbed on a, little farther, so as to make room for his companion to join him among, the fragments of broken rock upon which he stood.  And there, right, before them, the walls seemed to run together in the side of a black, mass of rock, which formed the base of a snowy peak, one which they, recognised as having often seen, and now looking the more brilliant in, contrast with the black rock from which it rose.\\n\\nSnow was dislodged, and went gliding down the gully, and for a moment a, great patch began to slide, taking Dale with it, but a few rapid leaps, carried him beyond it; and tightening the rope as soon as he had reached, a firm place, Saxe was able to pick his way after the snow had gone by, him with a rush, but only to stop a little lower down.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no.  These people who make discoveries of curiosities in the, mountains consider they have a perfect right to them, as sons of their, fatherland; and, as foreigners, I'm afraid we should get a great deal of, law and no profit if we raised the question.  The best way is to keep, our discoveries as secret as we can.  Now, then! what do you say to, drawing the curtains and going to sleep?\\\"\\n\\nIt is that last bit of snooze which is so enjoyable.  One goes to bed, because it is time, and after a good deal of waiting sometimes one goes, to sleep; but it is not the delicious, easy-going sleep of the last, half-hour in the morning--a sleep so enticing to most people: at all, events, boys feel as if they would barter all the rest of the night for, that half-hour--the last before rising.\\n\\nHe suited the action to the word; and soon after, fully equipped for, their little journey, the pair started, descended in due time to the, glacier, where the tiny streams were trickling fast in the hot sun, and, then toiled on and on through the never-wearying scenery, past the ends, of the two great, now very familiar, crevasses, and sat down at last to, a light lunch off the entrance to the black ravine.\\n\\nHe had cause to exclaim, for from where they stood they had an opening, before them right up a side valley running off from the glacier at a, sharp angle.  This, too, was filled by a glacier, a tributary of the one, they were upon, and with the sides of the minor valley covered with snow, wherever the slope was sufficient to hold it.  Beyond rose peak after, peak, flashing pure and white--higher and higher; and even the hollows, between them filled with soft-looking pillows and cushions of dazzling, snow.\\n\\nSaxe went on, now on one side of the tiny stream, now on the other, the, sides rising right and left almost perpendicularly at times.  But there, was plenty of good foot and hand-hold, so that Saxe made his way onward, and upward at a fair rate for mountaineering, and in a very short time, they had taken a last look of the glacier; the narrow rift, turned, almost at right angles, growing blacker and more forbidding in aspect at, every step.\\n\\n\\\"There, I can tell you little more, except that it was all wild, confusion, that the roar of the water seemed to crash against my ears, till I was once more in a shallow place; and as I struggled to get my, breath, I came to what seemed to be a bar, panting heavily till I could, turn a little, and I found that the bar to which I clung was the handle, of my ice-axe lying across two masses of stone, between which the waters, roared.\\n\\n\\\"What is he doing?\\\" thought Saxe.  \\\"I hope he will soon draw me up;\\\" and, a momentary feeling of panic came over him, and the rope felt painfully, cutting.  But just then he caught sight of a dark object against the, sky.  The dark object seemed to be descending, and the next moment he, saw that it was light, and he knew that the lanthorn was being sent down, at the end of the string.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Saxe, we have hit at last upon a veritable crystal mine,\\\" said, Dale, as he held up a fresh match above his head, whose light was, reflected from the facets of hundreds upon hundreds of crystals, depending from the roof and sides, and, as far as they could see for the, tiny glow, encircling the whole place; while Saxe now found that the, projection by which he held was a hexagonal piece as clear as glass.\\n\\n\\\"Go on, then,\\\" said Dale, rather reluctantly; and they continued, climbing, with the rock towering up on one side, the ice curving over on, the other, and rising in the middle of the glacier to a series of crags, and waves and smooth patches full of cracks, in which lay blocks of, granite or limestone that had been tumbled down from the sides or far up, toward the head of the valley ages before.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder how deep it is?\\\" said Saxe aloud, after shouting till he grew, hoarse, and speaking out now for the sake of hearing a voice in that, awful silence.  \\\"I wonder how deep it is?\\\" he said again, feeling, startled at the peculiar whisper which had followed his words.  \\\"It must, go right down to the rocks which form the bottom of the valley, and of, course this ice fills it up.  It may be fifty, a hundred, or five, hundred feet.  Who can say?\\\"\\n\\nafter which there was a fresh corner to be turned, where the wave that, rose up seemed somehow illuminated; but they were quite close up, with, the water almost running over the path, before they fully grasped that, the light came from the side, bringing with it some hope, even if it, were little; and at the same time Saxe felt the possibility of going, back the same way now that the full extent of the danger could be, grasped.\\n\\nHe plodded steadily on, and Saxe noted that he kept his eyes down and, seemed to make a business of every step, measuring exactly where he, should plant it, and keeping hold, as it were, with his other foot till, he was sure that his new step was safe.  Not that this took long, but it, appeared to be all carefully studied, and the boy learned that such, caution must be the result of experience and mean safety in his arduous, climbing.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Melchior!\\\" he muttered--\\\"it must have been impossible for him to, have led the mule through here;\\\" and as he thought, this, the full light, of day came streaming in, making Dale, a few yards before him, stand out, like a silhouette clearly cut in black, while for a hundred yards the, water now ran, rapidly widening and growing less like a torrent, till, right away he could see it flowing smoothly between the towering rocks, that were piled-up on either side of its bed.\\n\\nIt was no place for conversation, even if Saxe had been so disposed; for, every one's energies were taken up by the task of mastering the way, between or over the rugged blocks which filled the bottom of the place., But at last, at a sudden turn, a gleam of the white ice was seen, and, soon after Dale was busily obliterating the mark he had made that, morning for Melchior's guidance.\\n\\n\\\"I don't care; I will not give up hoping,\\\" he said to himself, as he, moved the ice-axe gently, and saw a ray or two more light.  Then he, began to wonder whether the heat of his body would melt enough of the, snow-ice about him to enable him to work his way out; and in this hope, he waited and rested for a few minutes, for the exertion even of moving, the axe seemed to set his heart beating fast.\\n\\nand after a few steps into what Saxe called a blue gloom, they stood, gazing into the azure depths of the cavern, which grew darker till they, were purple and then utterly black.  Then they listened to the gurgle, and babble of the tiny river, as it came rushing and dashing over the, rock in many an eddy and swirl, while from far away up in the darkness, there were mysterious whisperings and musical echoes that were strange, to hear.\\n\\n\\\"It's very silly lying here,\\\" he said to himself again, as the scent of, the burning pine-wood increased.  \\\"Bit cold outside the rug; but we left, the door and the windows open last night, and that's healthy all the, same.  I do wish, though, I could get on without being scared so soon., Perhaps it's all through being ill last year and feeling so weak.  But I, didn't seem weak yesterday.  I was precious tired, but so was Mr Dale., I'm afraid I'm a coward, and I suppose all I can do is to hide it and, not let people see.\\\"\\n\\nand had been brought up breathlessly with a sudden jerk, was swinging, slowly to and fro, clinging with both hands to the rope, and trying, vainly to get a rest for his feet on the smooth wall of ice, over which, his toes glided whenever he could catch it; but this was not often, for, the ice receded, and in consequence he hung so clear, that the line, turned with him, and he was at times with his back to the side from, which the rope was strained, gazing at the dimly-seen opposite wall\\n\\nIt was easier said than done, for the path was so narrow that Melchior, had to press the mule close to the perpendicular rock, and hold on by, the pack-saddle and then by the animal's neck, to get by.  Once he did, slip, his foot gliding over the edge; but by throwing himself forward he, saved himself, clung to the path for a few minutes as he hung over it\\n\\n\\\"Right!\\\" replied Dale; and a minute later he caught the rings of hemp, thrown to him, and rapidly knotted the middle round Saxe, the end to his, own waist; and as he knotted, _click, click! chip, chip_! went the, ice-axe, deftly wielded by the guide, who with two or three blows broke, through enough of the crust to make a secure footing while the ice flew, splintering down the slope in miniature avalanches, with a peculiar, metallic tinkling sound.\\n\\nwhich entailed a severe fight with self, for a sensation of hunger soon, developed itself.  But he won by a vigorous effort, and, after all was, ready, forced himself away from the fire and the kettle, walking right, out of the niche, to stand watching the glorious changes on the mountain, peaks, and the lines of light slowly creeping, downward and driving out, the shadows where it was still night while high up amongst the, glittering ice fields it was glorious day.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr, I will manage it all,\\\" said Melchior quietly.  \\\"I can soon, fetch the basket, and it will be better.  The young herr will want all, his activity to get along without a load.  I have been here four times, before.  I should have been five times; but one May the snow had melted, after a great rain, and the lake was so full that the waters were feet, above the pathway, and they rushed through, so that the great walls of, rock shook as if they would fall in.  There,\\\" he said, removing the, mule's load and carrying it two or three yards back, to place it against, the natural wall.  \\\"It will be quite safe there,\\\" he continued, with a, smile; \\\"nobody will come.  Ah, Gros, my friend, is that cool and, restful?\\\"\\n\\nThere was no time to think or reason in such a position.  He could see, the head, and feel the pressure of the feet; and he knew that he was not, dreaming now.  Frightened he was naturally, but he acted at once as a, lad of manly character might be expected to act: he struck out with his, doubled fist, giving the object a heavy blow just beneath the horns.\\n\\n\\\"Wait till he gets his breath, Melchior,\\\" said Dale.  \\\"There, boy, it, has been a splendid lesson for you, in a place where the worst that, could have happened to you was a sharp glissade and some skin off your, hands and face.  That ice-axe ought to have been driven like lightning, into the snow, or the pick held towards it downward.  It would have, ploughed in and anchored you.\\\"\\n\\nmuscular-looking man, whose swarthy face was sheltered by a wide-brimmed, soft felt hat, very much turned up at the sides, and in whose broad band, was stuck a tuft of the pale grey, starry-looking, downy plant known as, the Edelweiss.  His jacket was of dark, exceedingly threadbare velvet;, breeches of the same; and he wore gaiters and heavily nailed lace-up, boots; his whole aspect having evoked the remarks, when he presented, himself at the door of the chalet:\\n\\nIt was a picturesque sight, and wonderfully attractive to a hungry, boy,--the steaming kettle, the glowing fire lighting up the whole niche;, and, to make the sight more enjoyable, there was the savoury smell, one, which seemed to have had a peculiar effect upon Gros, the mule, for he, had left the patch where he was picking up a good succulent meal, to, draw near and stand blinking his eyes, flapping his long ears, and, staring, till Saxe drove him off as he came to take his place.\\n\\n\\\"Step by step I cut my way.  It was slow, tiring work; but every notch, made was a step nearer to liberty, and I worked on.  As I climbed higher, I had to cut my notches deeper, for the slope was not quite so easy, and, the slightest slip would have sent me to the bottom; and from the height, to which I had at last climbed this might have meant a broken arm or, leg, for there was no water to fall into but a few inches trickling, among the stones.\\n\\nHe held up his hand as a rushing noise was heard somewhere high up among, the dense mists.  This rapidly increased to a terrific roar, followed by, a deep booming crash; and so tremendous was the sound, that the noise of, the falling waters seemed for the moment to be hushed.  Then the, thunderous crash rolled right away among the mountains, dying in faint, echoes, and the rush of the waterfalls filled the air once more.\\n\\ntorn out of their birthplaces by tempests, or swept away by downfalls of, snow or rock; then they panted up some zigzag, faintly marked, where it, was impossible to follow the bed of the stream; and as they climbed, higher fresh visions of grandeur opened out before them, though the path, was so rugged that much of the view was lost in the attention that had, to be given to where they placed their feet.  But from time to time a, halt was called, a geological hammer produced, and a piece of the rock\\n\\nThere was no reply beyond what sounded like a groan; and the pair at the, edge of the crevasse began to tighten the rope gently as they drew up, their axes, with the weight gradually increasing; they saw by the light, of the lanthorn that they first dragged the poor fellow up into a, sitting position; and not having the full burden to deal with yet, Dale, got a shorter hold of the axe handle, Saxe doing the same.\\n\\nThat seemed as if it would not be long first, as far as the boy was, concerned.  He had apparently forgotten the numbness of his limbs and, the peril through which he had passed, and in spite of the roughness of, the ice and snow he continued to get over it in his extemporised, sandals, which had the advantage of not slipping.  But the day's toil, had been excessive before the accident; and though his spirits had kept, him up so far, the time was fast approaching when exhaustion would, conquer.\\n\\nBut there was no crash--no hissing, spattering of small fragments, dropping into water--nothing but the terrible silence, which seemed as, if it would never end; and at last a heavy dull splash, the hissing of, water, and a curious lapping sound repeated by the smooth water, till, all died away, and there was silence once again.  \\\"Awful!\\\" muttered, Saxe, as he wiped his damp brow.  \\\"Poor Melchior!--no wonder he didn't, answer to my cries.\\\"\\n\\nwhen seen from above on the bluff, had looked fairly smooth--just, in, fact, one great winding mass of ice flowing down in a curve to the foot., He was not prepared for the chaos of worn, tumbled and crushed-up, masses, among which the guide led the way.  Some parts that were, smoother were worn and channelled by the running water, which rushed in, all directions, mostly off the roughly curved centre to the sides, where, it made its way to the river beneath.\\n\\n\\\"In the dark?  How did you know where to hit?\\\" cried Saxe.  \\\"I could cut, steps in the ice blindfold, herr,\\\" said Melchior sharply.  \\\"When the, hands and arms have grown used to doing a thing, they can do it even if, the eyes are not watching them.  Of course I do not say I always struck, exactly in the right place, but I could get sufficiently near to make a, notch in the smooth ice; and I kept on, with my heart growing lighter as, I chipped away, listening to the echoing of the blows and the hissing, sound of the bits of ice as they slipped down the smooth face--for it, was perfectly smooth, and as if polished.\\n\\n\\\"I must have taken a dozen steps before my ice-axe checked against the, ice, and I threw myself against it, trying to calm my burning head by, resting it against what I took to be the arch of the large ice-cave into, which I had found my way; but, instead of the wall leaning over toward, me, as it would in a rugged arch, it sloped away.  I did not notice this, much as I leaned forward, for the ice felt delightfully cool against my, burning head; and as the coldness went in farther and farther, I seemed, to be able to think better and clearer, and this set me trying about, with the axe, till I found that I was at the bottom of a great ice, slope, as it seemed to me; and as I raised my head and gazed upward my, heart gave a great throb, for there, high up, far away, was a gleam of, light, and at the sight of that strength came to me, and I grasped my, axe tightly, for that meant escape from that terrible place, and life.\\n\\nThen came a warning cry from Melchior, who threw down his end of the, rope, and directly after began to descend with an ease that robbed his, task of all aspect of danger.  Every movement was so quietly and easily, made, there was such an elasticity of muscle and absence of strain, that, before the man was half down, both Dale and Saxe were wondering how they, could have thought so much of the task, and on Melchior joining them\\n\\nDale scanned the position anxiously, seeing now for the first time that, the rough angles and ridge-like pieces of rock along which the boy had, made his way ceased about five feet from where he stood, and that he, must have jumped on to a narrow piece of stone not a foot long and, somewhere about a third of that width; and though, in the vast chasm in, which they both were, the height above him, where Saxe was, spread-eagled, as it were, against the perpendicular rock, looked, perfectly insignificant, he was close upon a hundred feet up, and a fall, would have been very serious, if not fatal.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, herrs,\\\" he said; \\\"but we all try to do our best.  What was I, saying?  I remember: that I was falling down and down, and set my teeth, and held my axe with both hands to try and strike if I should reach a, slope, so as to stop myself; but there was nothing but the black walls, of ice on either side and the roar of waters below.  I thought of this, as I prepared myself for being broken on the cruel rocks beneath: a, great deal to think, herrs, in so short a time, but thoughts come, quickly when one is falling.  Then I was plunged suddenly into deep\\n\\nTwo hours' climb more than walk, with the sun coming down with scorching, power; but in spite of the labour, no weariness assailing the, travellers, for the air seemed to give new life and strength at every, breath they drew.  But now, in place of the view being more grand, as, they climbed higher the valley grew narrow, the scarped rocks on either, side towered aloft and shut out the snowy peaks, and at last their path, led them amongst a dense forest of pines, through whose summits the wind, sighed and the roaring torrent's sound was diminished to a murmur.\\n\\n\\\"Over those and many others beyond them,\\\" replied Dale; and then, as, they followed each other in single file, Melchior leading and the mule, close at his heels like a dog, weariness and the heat of the narrow, sun-bathed gorge put an end to conversation, till Saxe noticed that the, waters foaming along far down in the bottom were running in the same, direction as they were going, whereas earlier in the day they met them.\\n\\nIn this case it began to repeat the adventures of the day before, but in, a curiously bizarre manner; and in consequence Saxe found himself being, disappointed in the heights of the mountains, which were exceedingly, small--mere anthills covered with snow, up which he began to climb so as, to stand on their tops; but as he climbed they began to grow, so that, there was always a piece more to get up, and so he went on, finding that, there was no getting right to the top.  Then avalanches began to fall, rumbling and roaring down, and covering people at the bottom--hundreds, of them, so it seemed to him; and he could hear them moaning under the, snow, which by some curious chance of circumstances was just below him., But the odd thing was that they did not seem to mind it much, only, moaning piteously and impatiently, as if they were in a hurry for a thaw, to come and set them free.  Then one of them began to ring the bell for, dinner; and another did the same; and Saxe felt that he ought to be, doing something to take them food to eat--coarse bread, butter, cheese, like Gruyere, full of holes, and a jug of milk, but he did not do it\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; I am the guide,\\\" said Melchior quietly; and he began the, descent pretty rapidly, but stopped at the foot of each more difficult, part to look up and wait for the others.  Sometimes he drove the sharp, end of his ice-axe into the earth or some crevice, and held it there to, act as a step for the others to descend; and at other times he pressed, himself against the rock and offered his shoulders as resting-places for, their feet, constantly on the watch to lessen the difficulties and guard, against dangers in a place where a slip of a few feet might have, resulted in the unfortunate person who fell rolling lower with, increasing impetus, and the slip developing into a terrible accident.\\n\\nHere he was more at home, and able to think out how he could best pass, round that ledge and creep by this angle before he reached it.  Saxe did, not speak, but hung upon his back perfectly inert--a terrible load at, such a time; but the guide made no mental complaint,--simply toiled on, slowly enough for a couple of hours; then, thinking of a certain nook in, the mountain just below the snow-line where there was a good-sized clump, of dwarfed and distorted pines, he decided to stop there for the night\\n\\nSaxe raised his arms, which had felt nerveless the moment before, took a, fresh hold, and began to climb desperately.  The first movements were, horrible, and he felt the creeping sensation of horror once more, and, stopped, clinging hard, thinking that he could do no more; but the rope, was against his face, and as it vibrated he knew that even if he slipped, it would hold him, and the cold, dank sensation passed away again as he, got a good foothold and was helped by the strain on the rope; and just, while he was saying to himself, \\\"I shall never do it--I shall never do, it!\\\" a great hand seized the rope round his chest, and he was drawn, right on to a rocky platform, where Melchior was seated with his legs, widely apart, and his heels against two projecting corners.\\n\\n\\\"Hold my axe, sir,\\\" he said; and on Saxe taking it, the man picked up, the block he had chipped off, walked a little way from them, and, after, looking about a little, signed to them to watch, as he hurled the lump, from him, after raising it above his head.  As he threw it, he ran back, toward them, and the piece fell with a crash between two spires which, projected from the icy barrier.\\n\\nTo the surprise of all, the mule was perfectly satisfied so long as it, could keep its head and ears in the warmth and shelter, and never once, attempted to creep in nearer; and so another hour passed, only broken by, the low murmur of Dale's voice as he talked to the guide, and the plash, and rush of water.  For the dripping was drowned now by the enormous, amount which fell, and this went on increasing till there was quite a, heavy roar, as of many falls.\\n\\nin spite of Melchior's efforts to keep the way clear, the snow rose, about Saxe's face, so that very little more of it would have meant, suffocation.  The boy fought hard with his left hand to keep the snow, clear, but there was no space sufficient for him to sweep it right away;, and the moments grew more and more anxious as Melchior's axe cut and, chipped, and he tore out great pieces from the hole he was making and, hurled them down the slope.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" he said, \\\"let me bear out against the rope;\\\" and, raising the, ice-axe in both hands, he began to use it vigorously, cutting hard at, the frozen snow, till there was a sharp crack, and he threw himself back, while a huge piece of the cornice broke away and dropped down out of, sight.  Then all waited breathlessly till a faint hissing sound told, that it had touched rock or ground somewhere below, but how far down, Saxe did not realise, till Melchior made way for him to creep to the, extreme edge and look.\\n\\nSaxe seemed to have awakened from sleep with a terrible throbbing, headache, to listen to a curious digging sound which was going on over, his head.  He could hear a loud rumbling too, and, as he was still, wandering and confused at being suddenly awakened, as it appeared to, him, the truth came with a leap, just as the axe handle, which he still, held, was sharply agitated to keep the hole open, and Melchior's voice, came down to him.\\n\\n\\\"I have tried hard to win the herr's confidence, and to deserve it,\\\", said the man coldly.  \\\"I secured that rope as I believe any guide upon, the mountains would have fastened it.  The rope gave way not by breaking, or coming untied, and I cannot tell how.  I told the herr the beliefs of, my people, and that I had ceased to think that they were true; but we, are seeking to penetrate the mysteries of the mines, and this accident, has befallen us.  I can say no more.\\\"\\n\\nThese he whittled into shavings, and these shavings served to start the, green pine boughs which had formed their beds; and once a pretty good, glow was obtained, with plenty of embers, the wetness of the branches, brought under cover mattered very little, especially as the guide ranged, them close to the fire to dry, ready against they were required; and had, contrived that the blinding smoke should sweep right out at once, a few, broad branched boughs stuck in the ground or propped upright helping to, establish a draught.\\n\\ntill my arms began to grow heavy as lead.  But still I worked on, every, step cut bringing me nearer to the surface, though at the end of each, hour's hard labour I seemed very little advanced; and at last, as I grew, more weary, my spirits began to sink again, for the slope grew more and, more steep, though I would not own to it myself.  Still it was steeper, and steeper, and I cut desperately, and made deep notches into which I, forced my feet, while I cut again till the last part was nearly, perpendicular; and after cutting my last step I felt that my task was, done, for I had reached a ledge over which I was able to climb, till I, could lie half upon it, knowing that I had come to where the wall went, straight up, and that it would be impossible to hold on to that slippery, ice and cut my way higher.\\n\\n\\\"I'm beginning to understand now,\\\" said Saxe.  \\\"An ice slope is not a, very serious thing to a guide who has worked upon the mountains ever, since he was a boy, herrs.  Feeling satisfied now that I had but to cut, my way up step by step, I grew more easy in my mind, glanced up, and, then, after a little feeling about in the darkness, I chipped my first, step, just enough for my toe to hold in, rose up and cut another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, herr: so suddenly that I had not time to use my axe, and before I, could utter a cry I was falling fast down into the dark depths.  I, believe I did cry out for help, but the noise of ice and snow falling, and breaking on a ledge some way down drowned my voice; and as I turned, over in the air, I felt that I had made my last climb, and that the end, had come, as I had known it come to better guides.\\\"\\n\\nA slight rustling sound beneath the verandah had just taken Saxe's, attention, and he was wondering whether any one was in the low stone, cowhouse over which the chalet was built--from the economical ideas of, the people, who make one roof do for both places, and give to their, cattle an especially warm winter house--when the guide's words roused, him from his drowsy state, and he started up to gaze at the rather rare, phenomenon before him.\\n\\nThey turned back together for about a hundred yards over the smooth, snow, following their own steps clearly marked in the white surface; and, then stopped short aghast, for the deeply indented place in the snow, where they had landed in their jump was gone, and in its stead they saw, a great triangular-shaped opening widening the crevasse to more than, double its original dimensions, while just at its edge close to their, feet there was a peculiar mark, such as would have been made by an, ice-axe suddenly struck down through the snow to plough its way till it, disappeared over the edge.\\n\\n\\\"You know the rest, gentlemen.  You came and saved my life just when I, had not sufficient strength left to have tied the rope safely about my, waist.  It was the noose which saved me, and I could not believe in that, safety till you dragged me over the side of the crevasse.  Herr Dale--, Herr Saxe, how am I to say words to show you how thankful I am?\\\"\\n\\nEven in that little time the difference in the level of the water was, very evident; and as Saxe waded along, with the stream rushing by him, and seeming to give him quite a series of pushes, he could not help an, excited feeling of dread filling his breast, and he wondered whether he, should get out of the place alive if some sudden rush of water came down, in a wave and swept them off the ledge.\\n\\nUp this cleft they mounted steadily, till, to Saxe's surprise, he found, himself high above the mighty wall which shut in the valley, and only, now, as it were, at the foot of the mountains, which rose up fold beyond, fold, apparently endless, and for the most part snow-capped, with snow, lying deeply in the hollows, and filling up the narrow col or depression, between the peaks where they were to pass.\\n\\n\\\"It's horrible,\\\" said Saxe, in a subdued tone; and he turned and looked, down again where the guide had broken away the cornice, which curved out, over a tremendous precipice, and saw that had he followed his, inclination and slid down the snow slope, he would have gone over the, cornice, and then plunged headlong, to fall nearly sheer down what, seemed to be three or four thousand feet, to where a glacier wound along, past the foot of the precipice.\\n\\nand after a quick glance at the thick snow which arched over the, crevasse, he drew back; and Melchior led on again, striking the shaft of, his ice-axe handle down through the crust before him at every step, and, divining, by long practice and the colour of the snow, the direction of, the crevasse so well, that he only once diverged from the edge, sufficiently for the handle to go right down.\\n\\nMelchior seized the bridle and checked him, just as they were ascending, the first of a series of zigzags leading out of the deep valley, with, the result that the donkey brayed again and had to be held by main force, by Pierre's arm round his neck, for he had dragged his head out of the, bridle; while Gros began to kick and back and behave so obstreperously, that Dale gave him a sharp prod with the end of his alpenstock.\\n\\n\\\"No, herr; and it was so cold that it deadened a man's strength.  But I, knew I must fight for my life, for I said to myself I had my two English, herrs above there on the gletscher, and how could they find their way, back from the wilderness of ice?  Then I thought of how the little river, must run, and I could tell--for I knew it must be very much like the, places where I have looked up from the end of gletschers (glaciers you, call them)--that there would be deep holes worn in the rock where great, stones are always whirling round and grinding the hollows deeper.  These, would be hard to pass; but I hoped by clinging to the side to get by, them without being drowned.  They were not what I feared.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vorwarts,\\\" said the guide quietly; and they obeyed, following his lead, till they reached the spot where the clear waters of the fall glided, into the dingy stream, and then followed the latter up and up for quite, half an hour before Saxe stopped short, and took off his straw hat to, wipe his steaming forehead, as he gazed up at the end of the glacier; he, was now so low down that the surface was invisible, and facing him there, was a curve rising up and up, looking like a blunted set of natural, steps.\\n\\n\\\"There: that is safe,\\\" said Dale.  \\\"Now pick up your ice-axe and hold by, the rope with your left hand, so as to ease the strain upon your chest., Use the ice-axe cautiously, to keep yourself from turning round and from, striking against the side.  When you get down to the ledge, which must, be, from what you say, only just out of sight, you will chip a secure, place for your feet if the ice slopes, and, proceeding quite slowly and, calmly, make yourself first quite safe.  When this is done, unfasten the, rope from about you, and make it fast about poor Melchior.  Be very, particular about the knot, mind.  Don't forget what I have taught you., That knot must not slip in any way, either in tightening round his chest, or coming undone.\\\"\\n\\nHe suspended the English-made stout glass lanthorn to the little, ridge-pole; and then, resuming his jacket, he threw the coil of rope, over his shoulder, took his ice-axe, Dale and Saxe taking theirs, all, new and bright, almost as they had left the manufacturer's, and started, at once for the shelf from which the grand view of the snow-clad, mountains had met their gaze.  After proceeding along this a short, distance, Melchior stopped, climbed out upon a projecting point, and, examined the side of the precipice.\\n\\nAs Saxe stepped cautiously along, feeling his way by the wall and, beating the edge of the precipice with the handle of his ice-axe, he, felt over again the sensations he had had in passing along there that, morning.  But the dread was not so keen--only lest there should be a, sudden strain on the rope caused by one of them slipping; and he judged, rightly that, had one of them gone over the precipice here, nothing, could have saved the others, for there was no good hold that they could, seize, to bear up against the sudden jerk.\\n\\nHe wanted no explanation, for they were standing at the edge of a, precipice, gazing down at another huge glacier, which glittered in the, rays of the morning sun--a vast chaos of ice whose cracks and shadows, were of a vivid blue; and as they gazed up towards the point where it, suddenly curved round an immense buttress, there beyond, peak after, peak, as far as eye could reach, stood out in the clear air, and all, seeming to rise out of the fields and beds of snow which clung around, them and filled every ravine and chasm running up from their feet.\\n\\nThree or four awkward bits were circumvented; a couloir or gully full of, snow mounted; and then there was a long climb up a moderate slope toward, where a ridge of rocks stood out sharply, with snow sloping down on, either side, the ridge running up far into the mountain; but before they, could get to this a deep bed of old snow--\\\"firn\\\" Melchior called it--a, great sheet, like some large white field, had to be passed.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the stones are always falling from the bare sides of the gorge;, they drop on to the glacier, and in course of time are washed by the, melting ice into the crevasses and down to the bare rock beneath the, glacier.  There they glide down, with its weight upon them, right over, the rock, and the surface is worn off from the fallen stone and the bed, rock in a thin paste, which is washed away by the glacier.  Then, as it, descends, it of course discolours the water.\\\"\\n\\nDale had not been idle.  His first proceeding had been to throw a couple, of rugs over their companion, who in due time sat up to drink the hot, coffee with avidity.  He could only eat a few morsels of bread, but he, partook of the coffee again, and then sank back to drop into a heavy, sleep, and Saxe and Dale sat watching him for some time, forgetting, their own mental and bodily weariness in their anxiety respecting the, poor fellow's state.  But after bending over him several times, and, always with the same satisfactory discovery that the sufferer was, sleeping easily and well, both Dale and Saxe yielded to their own desire, to lie down, carrying on a conversation one minute and the next to be, sleeping as heavily as the guide.\\n\\nIt was as if that clump of pines would never be reached, and there were, moments when he was ready to think that he must have missed them; but a, glance to left or right at the rocks towering up into the sky sufficed, to convince him that he was still on the right track, for he knew them, by heart, and, giving his load a fresh shift, he toiled on again, hot\\n\\n\\\"Still, I would not give up, herrs; but reached up and cut till I felt, that I was gliding off the narrow ledge, and then I had to rest, and use, my axe to cut notches for my feet to hold and others for my hands, for, the least slip would have sent me down like a stone in a couloir, and I, wanted rest before I had to get down again.  I asked myself if I could;, and a cold feeling came over me, as I thought that all this work had, been for nothing, and that the end had now really come.\\n\\n\\\"As soon as I understood this I stopped, for I knew that the opening to, these rivers would grow smaller and smaller, and that it would be of no, use to go up there if I wanted to escape.  So, wading along, I tried to, reach the wall, to lean against it and rest before going back to the, torrent, knowing as I did that this must be the only way.\\n\\nSaxe nodded, took hold of the rope, turned round, reached up as high as, he could, and then was about to throw his whole weight upon it, when it, gave way, and came down upon him.  This, with the surprise, threw him, off his balance, and he would have gone down backward, headlong to the, bottom of the narrow cleft, but for the action of the guide, who darted, out one hand and caught him.\\n\\nFaintly as it was seen, it was plain enough to those who watched with, throbbing pulses.  The lanthorn had been beyond Melchior's reach, and as, he lay there on a kind of shelf or fault in the ice, he had tried to, hook the string toward him with his ice-axe, slipped, and would have, gone headlong down lower, but for the mountaineer's instinctive effort, to save himself by striking his axe-pick into the ice.\\n\\n\\\"No one can imagine how wonderful the mountains are,\\\" said the guide, solemnly.  \\\"I looked up at them as a little child, and I have been up, amongst them from a boy, while I am now thirty-five; and yet they are, always changing and ever new.  Sometimes they are all light and, sunshine, though full of hidden dangers.  Sometimes they are wild and, black and angry, when the wind shrieks and the lightning flashes about, their shattered heads, and the thunders roar.  Yes, young herr, you, never thought it was half so wonderful as this.  Shall we go on?\\\"\\n\\nIn spite of the delay it was still early; and, feeling no trace of his, last night's weariness, Saxe tramped on along the zigzag shelf in the, valley side, till the edge of the steep part was reached.  Melchior, strode off to the right, and then to the left, so as to reach the narrow, valley down which the stream came that had supplied them with water for, their morning's bath.\\n\\n\\\"Make any fellow sleep,\\\" he said to himself, as he raised his head; and, he was in the act of passing his hand across his wet lips, when he, became suddenly petrified, and stood there motionless, gazing straight, before him at a hideous object, apparently not a yard away.  It looked, misty and dim in the semi-darkness, but plain enough for the boy to see, apparently a huge head resting in a pair of hands, which held the chin, and pressed up the long loose cheeks on either side, curving up the, monstrous mouth into a ghastly grin.  The forehead was low, and the, eyebrows were shaggy, while from beneath them glared into his a great, pair of glowing eyes, that flashed at times and sparkled in the, starlight, which rained down on and through a bush of dark, tangled, hair, a portion of which hung below the head on either side, and stood, out wildly around.\",\n          \"The girl had stiffened a little at our approach, as I could see, but a, young girl's stiffness is always rather amusing than otherwise, and I, did not mind it. Neither, that I could see, did Mr. Glendenning, and it, soon passed. It seemed that she had left her mother lying down in her, state-room, where she justly imagined that if she did not see the rapids, she should suffer less alarm from them; the young lady had come frankly, to the side of Mrs. March as soon as she saw her, and asked if she might, sit with her. She now talked to me for a decent space of time, and then, presently, without my knowing how, she was talking to Mr. Glendenning\\n\\nIn their attempts to talk he was aware that she was seconding all his, endeavors with intelligence, and with a humorous subtlety to which he, could not pretend. She was suffering from their anomalous position as, much as he, but she had the means of enjoying it while he had not. After, half an hour of these defeats Mrs. Simpson operated a diversion by, coming in with two glasses of lemonade on a tray and some slices of, sponge-cake. She offered this refreshment first to Langbourne and then, to her niece, and they both obediently took a glass, and put a slice of, cake in the saucer which supported the glass. She said to each in turn\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir,\\\" said the old man when he rose to go at last, \\\"I guess, you've settled it for me. You've made me see that there can be an, immortal life that's worth living; and I was afraid there wa'n't! I, shouldn't care, now, if I woke up any morning in the other world. I, guess it would be all right; and that there would be new conditions, every way, so that a man could go on and be himself, without feelin', that he was in any danger of bein' wasted. You've made me want to meet, my boy again; and I used to dread it; I didn't think I was fit for it. I, don't know whether you expect me to thank you; I presume you don't; but, I\\\"--he faltered, and his voice shook in sympathy with the old hand that, he put trembling into Ewbert's--\\\"I _bless_ you!\\\"\\n\\nEvidently, Mrs. Bentley was very much worse than she had been; her, breathing was painfully labored. But if her daughter had any anxiety, about her condition, she concealed it most effectually from us. I, decided that she had perhaps been asking the doctor as to certain, symptoms that had alarmed her, and it was in the rebound from her, anxiety that her spirits had risen to the height I saw. Glendenning, seized the moment of her absence after luncheon, when she helped her, mother up to her room, to impart to me that this was his conclusion too., He said that he had not seen her so cheerful for a long time, and when I, praised her in every way he basked in my appreciation of her as if it, had all been flattery for himself. She came back directly, and then I, had a chance to see what she might have been under happier stars. She, could not, at any moment, help showing herself an intellectual and, cultivated woman, but her opportunities to show herself a woman of rare, social gifts had been scanted by circumstances and perhaps by, conscience. It seemed to me that even in devoting herself to her mother, as she had always done she need not have enslaved herself, and that it, was in this excess her inherited puritanism came out. She might, sometimes openly rebel against her mother's domination, as my wife and I, had now and again seen her do; but inwardly she was almost passionately, submissive. Here I thought that Glendenning, if he had been a different, sort of man, might have been useful to her; he might have encouraged her, in a little wholesome selfishness, and enabled her to withhold sacrifice, where it was needless. But I am not sure; perhaps he would have made her, more unhappy, if he had attempted this; perhaps he was the only sort of, man whom, in her sense of his own utter unselfishness, she could have, given her heart to in perfect peace. She now talked brilliantly and, joyously to me, but all the time her eye sought his for his approval and, sympathy; he, for his part, was content to listen in a sort of beatific, pride in her which he did not, in his simple-hearted fondness, make any, effort to mask.\\n\\n\\\"My dear fellow,\\\" I said, \\\"I see your point. But don't you think you are, quite needlessly adding to your affliction by pressing it? You two are, in the position which isn't at all uncommon with engaged people, of, having to wait upon exterior circumstances before you get married., Suppose you were prevented by poverty, as often happens? It would be a, hardship as it is now; but in that case would your engagement be any, less an error than it is now? I don't think it would, and I don't, believe you think so either.\\\"\\n\\nso vital at first, had perished in its formulation, and in the, repetition he was sensible, or he was fearful, of an insincerity, a, hollowness in the arguments he had originally employed so earnestly, against the old man's doubt. He recognized with dismay a quality of, question in his own mind, and he fancied that as Hilbrook waxed in, belief he himself waned. The conviction of a life hereafter was not, something which he was _sharing_ with Hilbrook; he was _giving_ it, absolutely, and with such entire unreserve that he was impoverishing his, own soul of its most precious possession.\\n\\nHe hardly knew how to dissemble the feeling of humiliation mixed with, indignation which flashed up in him, and which, he was afterwards, afraid, must have made him seem rather curt in his response to the head, waiter's civilities. Miss Axewright left the dining-room first, and he, hurried out to look her up as soon as he had despatched the coffee and, steak which formed his breakfast, with a wholly unreasoned impulse to, offer her some sort of reparation for the slight the conditions put upon, her. He found her sitting on the veranda beside the friendly tabby of, his last night's acquaintance, and far, apparently, from feeling the, need of reparation through him. She was very nice, though, and after, chatting a little while she rose, and excused herself to the tabby, with, a politeness that included Gaites, upon the ground of a promise to Miss, Desmond that she would come up, the first thing after breakfast, and see, how the piano was getting along.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I must allow that, if we are to suppose that young ladies have, anything to do with young men getting engaged to them; it doesn't seem, exactly delicate. But the novel phase of this great matter is the, position of the young lady's mother in regard to it. From what I could, make out she consents to the engagement of her daughter, but she don't, and won't consent to her marriage.\\\" My wife glared at me with so little, speculation in her eyes that I felt obliged to disclaim all, responsibility for the fact I had reported. \\\"Thou canst not say _I_ did, it. _They_ did it, and Miss Bentley, if any one, is to blame. It seems\\n\\nIf it was ridiculous, and if with her sense of the ridiculous she felt, it so, she was unable to take it lightly, or to make him take it, lightly. At some faint gleams which passed over her face he felt himself, invited to regard it less seriously; but he did not try, even, provisionally, and they fell into a silence that neither seemed to have, the power of breaking.\\n\\nThe girls' voices followed him down the walk,--Juliet's treble, and, Barbara's contralto,--and he believed that they were making talk, purposely against a pressure of silence, and did not know what they were, saying. It occurred to him that they had not asked how long he was, staying, or invited him to come again: he had not thought to ask if he, might; and in the intolerable inconclusiveness of this ending he, faltered at the gate till the lights in the windows of the parlor, disappeared, as if carried into the hall, and then they twinkled into, darkness. From an upper entry window, which reddened with a momentary, flush and was then darkened, a burst of mingled laughter came. The girls, must have thought him beyond hearing, and he fancied the laugh a burst, of hysterical feeling in them both.\\n\\nEwbert felt all the more impelled to his own first visit by the fame of, these failures, but he was not hastened in it. He thought best to wait, for some sign or leading from Hilbrook; but when none came, except the, apparent attention with which Hilbrook listened to his preaching, and, the sympathy which he believed he detected at times in the old eyes, blinking upon him through his sermons, he felt urged to the visit which, he had vainly delayed.\\n\\nbut they made us no formal invitation to come again, and we never did., That day, however, I caught a glimpse of Tedham's little girl, as she, flitted through the hall, after we were seated in the parlor; she was in, black, a forlorn little shadow in the shadow; and I recalled now, as we, stood once more on the threshold of the rather dreary house, a certain, gentleness of bearing in the child, which I found infinitely pathetic\\n\\never since he had arrived from the station at Birkwall's door, where, Mrs. Birkwall met them and welcomed him. He had been sufficiently, impressed with the aristocratic quiet of the vast square white old, wooden house, standing behind a high white board fence, in two acres of, gardened ground; but the fine hallway with its broad low stairway, the, stately drawing-room with its carving, the library with its panelling, and portraits, and the dining-room with its tall wainscoting, united to, give him a sense of the pride of life in old Burymouth such as the raw, splendors of the millionaire houses in New York had never imparted to, him.\\n\\nThen he told her, and he had trouble to keep her resentment in bounds., She held that, as a minister, he ought to have rebuked the wretched, creature; that it was nothing short of offensive to him for Hilbrook to, take such a position. She said his face was all flushed, and that she, knew he would not sleep, and she should get him a glass of warm milk;, the fire was out in the stove, but she could heat it over the lamp in a, tin cup.\\n\\nand glad of the southwestern breeze which he caught at this point over, the shoulder of the hill. He had expected to go round to the side door, of the house, where he had parted with Hilbrook on his former visit; but, he stopped on seeing the old man at his front door, where he was looking, vaguely at a mass of Spanish willow fallen dishevelled beside it, as if, he had some thought of lifting its tangled spray. The sun shone on his, bare head, and struck silvery gleams from his close-cropped white hair;, there was something uncommon in his air, though his dress was plain and, old-fashioned; and Ewbert wished that his wife were there to share his, impression of distinction in Hilbrook's presence.\\n\\nalways in her high, gay tinkle, that it was very pleasant there in the, summer time. He did not know what he answered. He was aware that from, time to time Miss Simpson said something in a frightened undertone. He, did not know how long it was before Mrs. Simpson made an errand out of, the room, in the abeyance which age practises before youthful society in, the country; he did not know how much longer it was before Miss Bingham, herself jumped actively up, and said, Now she would run over to Jenny's\\n\\nand better, with a good strong nurse, who could lift her this way and, that, and change her about, without feeling her heart-strings wrung at, every gasp, as that poor child must. Oh, I _wish_ Glendenning was man, enough to make her run off with him, and get married, in spite of, everything. But, of course, that's impossible--for a clergyman! And her, sacrifice began so long ago that it's become part of her life, and, she'll simply have to keep on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" the approachable tabby answered, \\\"it's the one at the piano. The, violinist is Miss Axewright, of South Newton. They were at the, Conservatory together in Boston, and they are such friends! Miss Desmond, would never have played here--intends to take pupils in Portland in the, winter--if Miss Axewright hadn't come,\\\" and the pleasant old tabby, purred on, with a velvety pat here, and a delicate scratch there. But, Gaites heard with one ear only; the other was more devotedly given to, the orchestra, which also claimed both his eyes. While he learned, as, with the mind of some one else, that the Desmonds had been very much, opposed to Phyllis's playing at the Inn, but had consented partly with, their poverty, because they needed everything they could rake and scrape, together, and partly with their will, because Miss Axewright was such a, nice girl, he was painfully adjusting his consciousness to the fact that, the girl at the piano was not the girl whom he had seen at Boston and, whom he had so rashly and romantically decided to be Miss Phyllis, Desmond. The pianist was indeed Miss Desmond, but to no purpose, if the, violinist was some one else; it availed as little that the violinist was, the illusion that had lured him to Lower Merritt in pursuit of Miss, Desmond's piano, if she were really Miss Axewright of South Newton.\\n\\neven if it could have had mercy, as an individual may, mercy was felt to, be bad morals, and the case was unrelentingly pushed. His sentence was, of those sentences which an eminent jurist once characterized as rather, dramatic; it was pronounced not so much in relation to his particular, offence, as with the purpose of striking terror into all offenders like, him, who were becoming altogether too common. He was made to suffer for, many other peculators, who had been, or were about to be, and was given, the full penalty. I was in court when it was pronounced with great, solemnity by the judge, who read him a lecture in doing so; I could have, read the judge another, for I could not help feeling that it was, more, than all the sentences I had ever heard pronounced, wholly out of, keeping with the offence. I met Hasketh coming out of the court-room\\n\\nThroughout the day, under his wife's watchful eye, he failed of the naps, he tried for, and he had to own himself as haggard, when night came, again, as the fondest anxiety of a wife could pronounce a husband. He, could not think of his talk with old Hilbrook without an anguish of, brain exhaustion; and yet he could not help thinking of it. He realized, what the misery of mere weakness must be, and the horror of not having, the power to rest. He wished to go to bed before the hour when Hilbrook, commonly appeared, but this was so early that Ewbert knew he should, merely toss about and grow more and more wakeful from his premature, effort to sleep. He trembled at every step outside, and at the sound of, feet approaching the door on the short brick walk from the gate, he and, his wife arrested themselves with their teacups poised in the air., Ewbert was aware of feebly hoping the feet might go away again; but the, bell rang, and then he could not meet his wife's eye.\\n\\nWe were somewhat surprised then to find her seated by the rail with the, younger lady of the two whom she meant to avoid if she meant anything by, what she said. She was laughing and talking on quite easy terms with her, apparently, and \\\"There!\\\" she triumphed as we came up, \\\"I've kept your, camp-stools for you,\\\" and she showed them at her side, where she was, holding her hand on them. \\\"You had better put them here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In that case we should not be opposing our wills to the will of some, one else, who has a better claim to her daughter's allegiance than I, have. It seems to me that our error was in letting her mother consent to, our engagement if she would not or could not consent to our marriage., When it came to that we ought both to have had the strength to say that, then there should be no engagement. It was my place to do that. I could, have prevented the error which I can't undo.\\\"\\n\\nIt was still raining heavily, and on the first cut beyond Porchester, Junction his train was stopped by a flagman, sent back from a, freight-train. There was a wash-out just ahead, and the way would be, blocked for several hours yet, if not longer. The express backed down to, Porchester, and there seemed no choice for Gaites, if he insisted upon, going to Craybrooks, but to take the first train up the old Boston and, Montreal line to Wells River and across by the Wing Road through, Fabyans; and this was what he did, arriving very late, but quite in time, for all he had to do at Craybrooks.\\n\\nThe street was straight, and while he was yet a good way off he saw the, gate open before the house, and a girl whom he recognized as Miss, Bingham close it behind her. She then came down under the maples towards, him, at first swiftly, and then more and more slowly, until finally she, faltered to a stop. He quickened his own pace and came up to her with a, \\\"Good-morning\\\" called to her and a lift of his hat. She returned neither, salutation, and said, \\\"I was coming to see you, Mr. Langbourne.\\\" Her, voice was still a silver bell, but it was not gay, and her face was, severely unsmiling.\\n\\neven if it should turn up then and there and personally appeal to him, for help. In this humor he was not prepared to have anything of the kind, happen, and he stood aghast, in looking absently into a freight-car, standing on the track, to read, \\\"Miss Phyllis Desmond, Lower Merritt, N., H.,\\\" on the slope of the now familiar case just within the open doorway., It was as if the poor girl were personally there pleading for his help, with the eyes whose tenderness he remembered.\\n\\n\\\"Well, if I ever!\\\" said Juliet Bingham, following her with astonished, eyes. Then she turned to Langbourne. \\\"It's perfectly ridiculous, and I, don't see how I can ever explain it. I don't think Barbara has shown a, great deal of tact,\\\" and Juliet Bingham was evidently prepared to make, up the defect by a diplomacy which she enjoyed. \\\"I don't know where to, begin exactly; but you must certainly excuse my--manner, when I came, in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, let it do for me!\\\" I confess that I was astonished at this, turn, or should have been, if I could be astonished at any turn a woman, takes. \\\"I will see her for you, if you wish, and I will tell her just, how it is with you, and then she can decide for herself. You have, certainly no right to decide for her, whether she will see you or not\\n\\nas it showed between the white mansions across the way. One of these, as, I have already mentioned, was the Conwell place; and after we had talked, of the landscape awhile, Glendenning said: \\\"By the way! Why don't you, buy the Conwell place? You liked it so much, and you were all so well in, Gormanville. The Conwells want to sell it, and it would be just the, thing for you, five or six months of the year.\\\"\\n\\ntill one summer, while we were still disputing where we should spend the, hot weather within business reach, there came a letter from him saying, that he was settled at Gormanville, and wishing that he might tempt us, up some afternoon before we were off to the mountains or seaside. This, revived all my wife's waning interest in him, and it was hard to keep, the answer I made him from expressing in a series of crucial inquiries, the excitement she felt at his being in New England and so near Boston\\n\\n\\\"Four o'clock,\\\" said the man. \\\"This freight goes out first;\\\" and now, Gaites noticed that up on a siding beyond the station an engine with a, train of freight-cars was fretfully fizzing. The engineer put a, silk-capped head out of the cab window and looked back at the, station-master, who began to work his arms like a semaphore telegraph., Then the locomotive tooted, the bell rang, and the freight-train ran, forward on the switch to the main track, and commenced backing down to, where they stood. Evidently it was going to pick up the car with Phyllis, Desmond's piano in it.\\n\\nand then stood staying herself against the piano-case, with a final, lamentation of \\\"Oh, it's a shame! I'll never speak to any of you again!, How perfectly mean! _Oh!_\\\" The last exclamation signalized the start of, the horses at a brisk mountain trot, which the driver presently sobered, to a walk. The three remaining girls followed, mocking and cheering, and, after them lounged the three remaining men, at a respectful distance\\n\\n\\\"Oh, did you, did you?\\\" He began to cry, and as we hurried along over, the fields, he sobbed with the wrenching, rending sobs of a man. \\\"I, _knew_ you did, and I believe it was God himself that put it into your, heart to write me that letter and take off that much of the blame from, me. I said to myself that if I ever lived through it, I would try to, tell you how much you had done for me. I don't blame you for refusing to, do what I've asked you now. I can see how you may think it isn't best\\n\\nThe lovers promised themselves, as we knew, that Mrs. Bentley would, relent, and abandon what was more like a whimsical caprice than a, settled wish. But as time wore on, and she gave no sign of changing, I, have wondered whether some change did not come upon them, which affected, them towards each other without affecting their constancy. I fancied, their youthful passion taking on the sad color of patience, and, contenting itself more and more with such friendly companionship as, their fate afforded; it became, without marriage, that affectionate, comradery which wedded love passes into with the lapse of as many years, as they had been plighted. \\\"What,\\\" I once suggested to my wife, in a, very darkling mood--\\\"what if they should gradually grow apart, and end, in rejoicing that they had never been allowed to join their lives?, Wouldn't that be rather Hawthornesque?\\\"\\n\\nGaites, you'll be the tea-table talk for a week; you'll be married to, that girl before you know it. What is the use of flying in the face of, Providence? Come! There's time enough to get a ticket, and have your, check changed from Kent Harbor to Lower Merritt, and the Hill Country, express will be along here at nine o'clock. You can't let that poor, thing start off on her travels alone again!\\\"\\n\\nwhich inculcated with the peculiar grace of his gentle, poetic nature a, refinement of the mystical theology of the founder. The Rev. Adoniram, Rixon, who had seventy years before formulated his conception of the, religious life as a patient waiting upon the divine will, with a, constant reference of this world's mysteries and problems to the world, to come, had doubtless meant a more strenuous abeyance than Clarence, Ewbert was now preaching to a third generation of his followers. He had, doubtless meant them to be eager and alert in this patience, but the, version of his gospel which his latest apostle gave taught a species of, acquiescence which was foreign to the thoughts of the founder. He put as, great stress as could be asked upon the importance of a realizing faith, in the life to come, and an implicit trust in it for the solution of the, problems and perplexities of this life; but so far from wishing his, hearers to be constantly taking stock, as it were, of their spiritual, condition, and interrogating Providence as to its will concerning them\\n\\nbut we had misgivings of the village mansion; and I am afraid that I, rather unduly despatched the personal part of my letter, in my haste to, ask what Glendenning knew and what he thought of the Conwell place., However, the letter seemed to serve all purposes. There came a reply, from Glendenning, most cordial, even affectionate, saying that the, Conwell place was delightful, and I must come at once and see it. He, professed that he would be glad to have Mrs. March come too, and he, declared that if his joy at having us did not fill his modest rectory to, bursting, he was sure it could stand the physical strain of our, presence, though he confessed that his guest-chamber was tiny.\\n\\n\\\"I know I oughtn't to have come. I know I oughtn't to have written to, you in the beginning, but you had let me write, and I thought you would, let me come. I tried always to be sincere with you; to make you feel, that you could trust me. I believe that I am an honest man; I thought I, was a better man for having known you through your letters. I couldn't, tell you how much they had been to me. You seemed to think, because I, lived in a large place, that I had a great many friends; but I have very, few; I might say I hadn't any--such as I thought I had when I was, writing to you. Most of the men I know belong to some sort of clubs; but, I don't. I went to New York when I was feeling alone in the world,--it, was from something that had happened to me partly through my own, fault,--and I've never got over being alone there. I've never gone into, society; I don't know what society is, and I suppose that's why I am, acting differently from a society man now. The only change I ever had, from business was reading at night: I've got a pretty good library., After I began to get your letters, I went out more--to the theatre, and, lectures, and concerts, and all sorts of things--so that I could have, something interesting to write about; I thought you'd get tired of, always hearing about me. And your letters filled up my life, so that I, didn't seem alone any more. I read them all hundreds of times; I should, have said that I knew them by heart, if they had not been as fresh at, last as they were at first. I seemed to hear you talking in them.\\\" He, stopped as if withholding himself from what he had nearly said without, intending, and resumed: \\\"It's some comfort to know that you didn't want, them back because you doubted me, or my good faith.\\\"\\n\\nHilbrook's apathy was gone, and his gentleness; he had suddenly an air, and tone of fierce challenge. As he spoke he brought a clenched fist, down on the arm of his chair; he pushed his face forward and fixed, Ewbert with the vitreous glitter of his old eyes. Ewbert found him, terrible, and he had a confused sense of responsibility for him, as if, he had spiritually constituted him, in the charnel of unbelief, out of, the spoil of death, like some new and fearfuler figment of, Frankenstein's. But if he had fortuitously reached him, through the one, insincerity of his being, and bidden him live again forever, he must not, forsake him or deny him.\\n\\nThis measurably consoled my wife, but she did not cease to denounce the, idea for some moments. When she ended, I asked her if she would allow, the company to employ Tedham in a subordinate place in another city, and, when she signified that this might be suffered, I said that this was, what would probably be done. Then I added, seriously, that I thoroughly, liked the notion of it, and that I took it for a testimony that poor old, Tedham was right, and that he had at last fully expiated his offence, against society.\\n\\nHe had arrived at this extreme before he received the note from Mrs., Birkwall, which she made his prompt bread-and-butter letter the excuse, of writing him. She wrote mainly to remind him of his promise to stay, another day with her husband on his way home through Burymouth; and she, alleged an additional claim upon him because of what she said she had, made Birkwall do for him. She had made him go down to the freight-depot, every day, and see what had become of Phyllis Desmond's piano; and she, had not dared write before, because it had been most unaccountably, delayed there for the three days that had now passed. Only that morning\\n\\nFriendship between girls is never equal; they may equally love each, other, but one must worship and one must suffer worship. Langbourne read, the differing temperaments necessary to this relation in the differing, voices. That which bore mastery was a low, thick murmur, coming from, deep in the throat, and flowing out in a steady stream of indescribable, coaxing and drolling. The owner of that voice had imagination and humor, which could charm with absolute control her companion's lighter nature\\n\\nI recalled, now, looking at him there in the twilight of the woods, how, happy they had both seemed that sunny afternoon in the city square, as, they flashed away from my door and glanced back at me and smiled, together. I went into the house and said to my wife with a formulation, of the case which pleased me, \\\"If there is anything in the world that, Tedham likes better than to ride after a good horse, it is to ride after, a good horse with that little girl of his.\\\" \\\"Yes,\\\" said my wife, \\\"but a, good horse means a good deal of money; even when a little girl goes with, it.\\\" \\\"That is so,\\\" I assented, \\\"but Tedham has made a lot lately in real, estate, they say, and I don't know what better he could do with his, money; or, I don't believe _he_ does.\\\" We said no more, but we both, felt, with the ardor of young parents, that it was a great virtue, a, saving virtue, in Tedham to love his little girl so much; I was, afterward not always sure that it was. Still, when Tedham appealed to me, now in the name of his love for her, he moved my heart, if not my, reason, in his favor; those old superstitions persist.\\n\\nfor my own sake, if not for his, but I had nothing in mind but that I, had better keep there, and so I waited for him to speak. I believed he, was beating about the bush in his own thoughts, to find some indirect or, sinuous way of getting at what he wanted to know, and that it was only, because he failed that he asked bluntly, \\\"March, do you know where my, daughter is?\\\"\\n\\nShe resumed: \\\"But when your picture came, I said it had _got_ to stop;, and so we just sent back my picture,--or I don't know but what Barbara, did it without asking me,--and we did suppose that would be the last of, it; when you wrote back you were coming here, we didn't believe you, really would unless we said so. That's all there is about it; and if, there is anybody to blame, I am the one. Barbara would never have done, it in the world if I hadn't put her up to it.\\\"\\n\\nHe woke next morning in a wide, low, square chamber to the singing of, robins in the garden, from which at breakfast he had luscious, strawberries, and heaped bowls of June roses. When he started for his, train, he parted with Mrs. Birkwall as old friends as he was with her, husband; and he completed her conquest by running back to her from the, gate, and asking, with a great air of secrecy, but loud enough for, Birkwall to hear, whether she thought she could find him another girl in, Burymouth, with just such a house and garden, and exactly like herself, in every way.\\n\\nand that made me all the more anxious to know just how much of the, trouble she had taken in. I suppose it was all a kind of awful mystery, to her, as most of our trials are to children; but when her father was, taken from her, she seemed to think it was something she mustn't ask, about; there are a good many things in the world that children feel that, way about--how they come into it, for one thing, and how they go out of, it; and by and by she didn't speak of it. She had some of his lightness\\n\\nThe cordial interest of the university people was hardly a compensation, for the disappointment he shared with Hilbrook; but his wife was so, happy in it that he could not say anything to damp her joy. \\\"Now,\\\" she, declared, on their way home, \\\"I am perfectly satisfied that they will, keep coming. You never preached so well, Clarence, and if they have any, appreciation at all, they simply won't be able to keep away. I wish you, could have heard all the nice things they said about you. I guess, they've waked up to you, at last, and I do believe that the idea of, losing you has had a great deal to do with it. And _that_ is something, we owe to old Ransom Hilbrook more than to anything else. I saw the poor, old fellow hanging about, and I couldn't help feeling for him. I knew he, wanted to speak with you, and I'm not afraid that he will be a burden, again. It will be such an inspiration, the prospect of having the, university people come every Sunday, now, that you can afford to give a, little of it to him, and I want you to go and see him soon; he evidently, isn't coming till you do.\\\"\\n\\nand, so far as he could make out, had been born engaged to her; and he, showed an intuition in the gingerly handling of her rather uncertain, temper which augured well for his future happiness. His future happiness, seemed to be otherwise taken care of, for though he was a young man of, no particular prospects, and no profession whatever, he had a generous, willingness to liberate his affianced to an artistic career; or, at, least, there was no talk of her giving up her scheme of teaching the, piano-forte because she was engaged to be married, he was exactly fitted, to become the husband of a wage-earning wife, and was so far from being, offensive in this quality that everybody (including Miss Desmond, rather, fitfully) liked him; and he was universally known as Charley Ellett.\\n\\nIn those words the implication that Miss Bingham had operated the whole, affair finally unfolded itself. But distasteful as the fact was to, Langbourne, and wounding as was the realization that he had been led on, by this witness of his infatuation for the sake of the entertainment, which his letters gave two girls in the dull winter of a mountain, village, there was still greater pain, with an additional embarrassment\\n\\nHe was undoubtedly getting older, and he looked it. He was one of those, gentle natures which put on fat, not from self-indulgence, but from want, of resisting force, and the clerical waistcoat that buttoned black to, his throat swayed decidedly beyond a straight line at his waist. His, red-gold hair was getting thin, and though he wore it cut close all, round, it showed thinner on the crown than on the temples, and his pale, eyebrows were waning. He had a settled patience of look which would have, been a sadness, if there had not been mixed with it an air of resolute, cheerfulness. I am not sure that this kept it from being sad, either.\\n\\nwhich would perpetually provoke and satisfy. Her companionship would be, as easy and reasonable as a man's, while it had the charm of a woman's., At the moment it seemed to him that life without this companionship, would be something poorer and thinner than he had yet known, and that he, could not endure to forego it. Somehow he must manage to see the girl, and make her acquaintance. He did not know how it could be contrived\\n\\nWhen the train pulled out of the station into the clearer light, she, turned her face from him toward the forward window, and the corner of, her mouth, which her half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of, piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an, upward curve, and a gay light came into the corner of her eye; then the, mouth drooped again, and the light went out.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm quite willing to be cheerful about it, my dear,\\\" I returned;, \\\"and, if you like, we will fancy Mrs. Bentley coming round and ardently, wishing their marriage, and their gayly protesting that after having, given the matter a great deal of thought they had decided it would be, better not to marry, but to live on separately for their own sake, just, as they have been doing for hers so long. Wouldn't that be cheerful?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nice fo-aks,\\\" said the conductor, providing himself for conversational, purposes with a splinter from the floor. He put it between his teeth and, continued: \\\"I took ca' thei' hosses, one while, as long's they _had_, any, before I went on the ro-ad. Old gentleman kep' up a show till he, died; then the fam'ly found out that they hadn't much of anything but, the place left. Girls had to do something, and one of 'em got a place in, a school out West--smaht, _all_ of 'em; the second one kind o' runs the, fahm; and the youngest, here, 's been fittin' for a music-teacha. Why\\n\\nI could not go away, and I walked down the path to the gate, and waited, there, in case I should be in any wise wanted. After a very long time, the doctor came bolting over the walk towards me, as if he did not see, me, but he brought himself up short with an \\\"Oh!\\\" before he actually, struck against me. I had known him during our summer at the Conwell, place, where we used to have him in for our little ailments, and I would, never have believed that his round, optimistic face could look so, worried. I read the worst in it; Glendenning was right; but I asked the, doctor, quite as if I did not know, whether there was anything serious, the matter.\\n\\nIt was some time after the Ewberts had given up expecting him that old, Hilbrook came to return the minister's visit. Then, as if some excuse, were necessary, he brought a dozen eggs in a paper bag, which he said he, hoped Mrs. Ewbert could use, because his hens were giving him more than, he knew what to do with. He came to the back door with them; but Mrs., Ewbert always let her maid of all work go out Sunday evening, and she, could receive him in the kitchen herself. She felt obliged to make him, the more welcome on account of his humility, and she showed him into the, library with perhaps exaggerated hospitality.\\n\\n\\\"You didn't go to the Book for the point you made _against_ me. But if, you go to it now for the point I want you to make _for_ me, what are you, going to find? Are you going to find the promise of a life any different, from the life we have here? I accept it all,--all that the Old Testament, says, and all that the New Testament says; and what does it amount to on, this point?\\\"\\n\\nI have no wish, and if I had the wish I should not have the art, to keep, back the fact that these young people were evidently very much taken, with each other. They showed their mutual pleasure so plainly that even, I could see it. As for Mrs. March, she was as proud of it as if she had, invented them and set them going in their advance toward each other\\n\\nWe made what speed we could after them, but they were long out of sight, in the mile that it seemed to me we were an hour in covering before we, reached the Bentley place. The doctor's buggy stood at the gate, and I, perceived that I was without authority to enter the house, on which some, unknown calamity had fallen, no matter with what good-will I had come; I, could see that Glendenning had suffered a sudden estrangement, also\\n\\nHamilton Gaites sat breakfasting by the window of a restaurant looking, out on Park Square, in Boston, at a table which he had chosen after, rejecting one on the Boylston Street side of the place because it was, too noisy, and another in the little open space, among evergreens in, tubs, between the front and rear, because it was too chilly. The wind, was east, but at his Park Square window it tempered the summer morning, air without being a draught; and he poured out his coffee with a content, in his circumstance and provision which he was apt to feel when he had, taken all the possible pains, even though the result was not perfect., But now, he had real French bread, as good as he could have got in New, York, and the coffee was clear and bright. A growth of crisp green, watercress embowered a juicy steak, and in its shade, as it were, lay, two long slices of bacon, not stupidly broiled to a crisp, but, delicately pink, and exemplarily lean. Gaites had already had a, cantaloupe, whose spicy fragrance lingered in the air and mingled with, the robuster odors of the coffee, the steak, and the bacon.\\n\\nIt should not be difficult to overcome it; but Ewbert had not yet, succeeded in arraying his reasons satisfactorily against it when his, wife returned from her work in the kitchen, and sat down beside the, library table. Her coming operated a total diversion, in which Hilbrook, lapsed into his apathy, and was not to be roused from it by the, overtures to conversation which she made. He presently got to his feet, and said he mast be going, against all her protests that it was very, early. Ewbert wished to walk home with him; but Hilbrook would not, suffer this, and the minister had to come back from following him to the, gate, and watching his figure lose itself in the dark, with a pang in, his heart for the solitude which awaited the old man under his own roof., He ran swiftly over their argument in his mind, and questioned himself, whether he had used him with unfailing tenderness, whether he had let, him think that he regarded him as at all reprobate and culpable. He gave, up the quest as he rejoined his wife with a long, unconscious sigh that, made her lift her head.\\n\\nI did not say anything, for my heart was in my throat, and we stumbled, along in silence till we climbed the last wall, and stood on the, sidewalk that skirted the suburban highway. There, under the, street-lamp, we stopped a moment, and it was he who now offered me his, hand for parting. I took it, and we said, together, \\\"Well, good-by,\\\" and, moved in different directions. I knew very well that I should turn back\\n\\nBut Miss Alber was already engaged for canoeing, and Gaites was obliged, to drive off with his hostess alone. She said she did pity him, but she, pitied him no longer than it took to get at the express agent. Then she, began to pity herself, and much more energetically if not more, sincerely, for it seemed that the agent had not been able to learn, anything about her trunk, and was unwilling even to prophesy concerning, it. Gaites left him to question at her hands, which struck him as, combining all the searching effects of a Roentgen-ray examination and the, earlier procedure with the rack; and he wandered off, in a habit which, he seemed to have formed, toward the freight-house.\\n\\nEwbert had forgotten the points he had made before, and he had to take, up the whole subject anew, he did so at first in an involuntarily, patronizing confidence that Hilbrook was ignorant of the ground; but, from time to time the old man let drop a hint of knowledge that, surprised the minister. Before they had done, it appeared that Hilbrook, was acquainted with the literature of the doctrine of immortality from, Plato to Swedenborg, and even to Mr. John Fiske. How well he was, acquainted with it Ewbert could not quite make out; but he had, recurrently a misgiving, as if he were in the presence of a doubter, whose doubt was hopeless through his knowledge. In this bleak air it, seemed to him that he at last detected the one thing in which the old, man felt an interest: his sole tie with the earth was the belief that, when he left it he should cease to be. This affected Ewbert as most, interesting, and he set himself, with all his heart and soul, to, dislodge Hilbrook from his deplorable conviction. He would not perhaps, have found it easy to overcome at once that repugnance which Hilbrook's, doubt provoked in him, if it had been less gently, less simply owned. As, it was, it was not possible to deal with it in any spirit of mere, authority. He must meet it and overcome it in terms of affectionate, persuasion.\\n\\n\\\"She suffers terribly from asthma. I don't suppose she has lain down in, bed for ten years. She sleeps in an easy-chair, and she's never quite, free from her trouble; when there's a paroxysm of the disease, her, anguish is frightful. I've never seen it, of course, but I have heard, it; you hear it all through the house. Edith has the constant care of, her. Her mother has to be perpetually moved and shifted in her chair\\n\\nwithout seeing her; she rose at once and went out to him. Ewbert heard, her asking him into the library, and then he heard them in parley there;, and presently they came out into the hall again, and went to the front, door together. Ewbert's heart misgave him of something summary on her, part, and he did not know what to make of the cheerful parting between, them. \\\"Well, I bid you good-evening, ma'am,\\\" he heard old Hilbrook say, briskly, and his wife return sweetly, \\\"Good-night, Mr. Hilbrook. You, must come soon again.\\\"\\n\\nEwbert could not deny this, though he did not feel himself so much to, blame for it as she would have liked to make out in her pity of him. He, owned that if he had never gone to see Hilbrook the old man would, probably never have come near them, and that if he had not tried so much, to interest him when he did come Hilbrook would not have stayed so long;, and even in this contrite mind he would not allow that he ought not to, have visited him and ought not to have welcomed him.\\n\\n\\\"He seems to be an Episcopal clergyman,\\\" she said, in a haughty summing, up. \\\"From his name I should have supposed he was Scotch and a, Presbyterian.\\\" She began to patronize the trip we were making, and to, abuse it; she said that she did not see what could have induced them to, undertake it; but one had to get back from Niagara somehow, and they had, been told at the hotel there that the boats were very comfortable. She, had never been more uncomfortable in her life; as for the rapids, they, made her ill, and they were obviously so dangerous that she should not, even look at them again. Then, from having done all the talking and most, of the eating, she fell quite silent, and gave her daughter a chance to, speak to my wife. She had hitherto spoken only to her mother, but now, she asked Mrs. March if she had ever been down the St. Lawrence before.\\n\\nand look the ground over, and see how much we have been suffering for, them unnecessarily.\\\" The fact was that we had now scarcely spoken of, Glendenning or the Bentleys for six months, and our minds were far too, full of our own affairs to be given more than very superficially to, theirs at any time. \\\"We could both go as well as not,\\\" I suggested, \\\"and, you could call upon the Bentleys while I looked after the company's, business.\\\"\\n\\nIt was so long since he had known a Northern spring that he had, forgotten how much later the beginning of May was in New Hampshire; but, as his train ran up from Springfield he realized the difference of the, season from that which he had left in New York. The meadows were green, only in the damp hollows; most of the trees were as bare as in, midwinter; the willows in the swamplands hung out their catkins, and the, white birches showed faint signs of returning life. In the woods were, long drifts of snow, though he knew that in the brown leaves along their, edges the pale pink flowers of the trailing arbutus were hiding their, wet faces. A vernal mildness overhung the landscape. A blue haze filled, the distances and veiled the hills; from the farm door-yards the smell, of burning leaf-heaps and garden-stalks came through the window which he, lifted to let in the dull, warm air. The sun shone down from a pale sky\\n\\nGaites saw in Ellett's impudent, amusing face that he divined, Millicent's continued ignorance of his romance, and was bent on, mischief. But the girl paid no heed to his talk, and Gaites could not, help laughing. He liked the fellow; he even liked Miss Desmond, who was, so much softened by the occasion that she had all the thorny allure of a, ripened barberry in his fancy. They both hung about the seat, where he, stood ready to take his place beside Millicent, till the conductor, shouted, \\\"All aboard!\\\" Then they ran out, and waved to the lovers, through the window till the car started.\\n\\nA stir of garments made itself heard from the parlor at last, and we, knew the ladies had risen. In a loud voice Hasketh began to say that, they had a carriage down at the gate, and I said they had better let me, show them the way down; and as my wife followed the others into the, hall, I pulled open the outer door for them. On the threshold stood a, man about to ring, who let his hand drop from the bell-pull. \\\"Why\\n\\nI have often had to criticise life for a certain caprice with which she, treats the elements of drama, and mars the finest conditions of tragedy, with a touch of farce. No one who witnessed the marriage of Arthur, Glendenning and Edith Bentley had any belief that she would survive it, twenty-four hours; they themselves were wholly without hope in the, moment which for happier lovers is all hope. To me it was like a, funeral, but then most weddings are rather ghastly to look upon; and the, stroke that life had in reserve perhaps finally restored the lost, balance of gayety in this. At any rate, Mrs. Glendenning did live, and, she is living yet, and in rather more happiness than comes to most, people under brighter auspices. After long contention among many, doctors, the original opinion that her heart trouble was functional, not, organic, has been elected final, and upon these terms she bids fair to, live as long as any of us.\\n\\nGaites flushed in a joyful confusion, and put the joke by as well as he, could. But he was beginning to feel it not altogether a joke; it had, acquired an element of mystery, of fatality, which flattered while it, awed him; and he could not be easy till he had asked one of the, freight-handlers what had happened to the car. He got an answer--flung, over the man's shoulder--which seemed willing enough, but was wholly, unintelligible in the clang and clatter of a passenger-train which came, pulling in from the southward.\\n\\nHe amused himself thinking what he should do if he found Phyllis, Desmond's piano there, but he was wholly unprepared to do anything when, he actually found it standing on the platform, as if it had just been, put out of the freight-car which was still on the siding at the door. He, passed instantly from the mood of gay conjecture in which he was playing, with the improbable notion of its presence to a violent indignation.\\n\\n\\\"I guess we're built like an onion,\\\" he said, with a severity that, forbade Ewbert to feel anything undignified in the homely illustration., \\\"You can strip away layer after layer till you seem to get to nothing at, all; but when you've got to that nothing you've got to the very thing, that had the life in it, and that would have grown again if you had put, it in the ground.\\\"\\n\\nHe confided equally in my wife and myself, but there were times when I, think he rather preferred the counsel of a man friend. Once when we had, gone a walk into the country, which around Gormanville is of the, pathetic Mid-Massachusetts loveliness and poverty, we sat down in a, hillside orchard to rest, and he began abruptly to talk of his affair., Sometimes, he said, he felt that it was all an error, and he could not, rid himself of the fear that an error persisted in was a wrong, and, therefore a species of sin.\\n\\nRansom Hilbrook came and went among the villagers in the same sort of, inaccessible contiguity. He did not shun passing the time of day with, people he met; he was in and out at the grocer's, the meat man's, the, baker's, upon the ordinary domestic occasions; but he never darkened any, other doors, except on his visits to the bank where he cashed the checks, for his quarterly allowance. There had been a proposition to use him, representatively in the ceremonies celebrating the acceptance of the, various gifts of Josiah Hilbrook; but he had not lent himself to this\\n\\n\\\"Might 'a' got off on some branch road, by mistake, and waited there, till it was looked up. You see,\\\" the man continued, resting an elbow on, the tall casing of a chest of drawers, and dropping to a more, confidential level in his manner, \\\"an upright piano ain't like a, passenger. It don't kick if it's shunted off on the wrong line. As a, gene'l rule, freight don't complain of the route it travels by, and it, ain't in a hurry to arrive.\\\"\\n\\nI did indeed remember Tedham's affection for his daughter, whom I, remembered as in short frocks when I last saw them together. It was, before my own door in town. Tedham had driven up in a smart buggy behind, a slim sorrel, and I came out, at a sign he made me through the, bow-window with his whip, and saw the little maid on the seat there, beside him. They were both very well dressed, though still in mourning, for the child's mother, and the whole turnout was handsomely set up., Tedham was then about thirty-five, and the child looked about nine. The, color of her hair was the color of his fine brown beard, which had as, yet no trace of gray in it; but the light in her eyes was another light\\n\\nand he was carrying a load that nobody could bear up under. She, addressed these declarations to her lingering consciousness of Ransom, Hilbrook, and confirmed herself, by their repetition, in the belief that, he had not taken her generalizations personally. She now extended these, so as to inculpate the faculty of the university, who ought to have felt, it their duty not to let a man of Ewbert's intellectual quality stagger, on alone among them, with no sign of appreciation or recognition in the, work he was doing, not so much for the Rixonite church as for the whole, community. She took several ladies at the hotel into her confidence on, this point, and upon study of the situation they said it was a shame., After that she felt more bitter about it, and attributed her husband's, collapse to a concealed sense of the indifference of the university, people, so galling to a sensitive nature.\\n\\n\\\"That terrible old man,\\\" she said, \\\"has simply been draining the life, out of you, Clarence. I saw it from the beginning, and I warned you, against it; but you wouldn't listen to me. _Now_ I suppose you _will_, listen, after the doctor tells you that you're in danger of nervous, prostration, and that you've got to give up everything and rest. _I_, think you've been in danger of losing your reason, you've overworked it, so; and I sha'n't be easy till I've got you safely away at the seaside\\n\\n\\\"You asked me just now why I didn't think character, as we call it, gave, us some right to expect a life after this. Well, I'll try to tell you. I, consider that I've been the rounds, as you may say, and that I've got as, much character as most men. I've had about everything in my life that, most have, and a great deal more than some. I've seen that everything, wears out, and that when a thing's worn out it's for good and all. I, think it's reasonable to suppose that when I wear out it will be for, good and all, too. There isn't anything of us, as I look at it, except, the potentiality of experiences. The experiences come through the, passions that you can tell on the fingers of one hand: love, hate, hope\\n\\nGaites thought of all his own anxieties and interferences in behalf of, the piano of this ungrateful girl, and in her presence he resolved that, his lips should be forever sealed concerning them. She never would take, them in the right way. But he experimented with one suggestion. \\\"Perhaps, she was taken with the beautiful name on the piano-case, and couldn't, help telegraphing just for the pleasure of writing it.\\\"\\n\\nI did not go till the following week, when I found that no one had, attempted to snap up the Conwell place. In fact, it rather snapped me, up, I secured it with so little trouble. I reported it so perfect that, all my wife's fears of a latent objection to it were roused again. But, when I said I thought we could relinquish it, her terrors subsided; and, I thought this the right moment to deliver a stroke that I had been, holding in reserve.\\n\\nHe woke to the sound of a quick snort, in which he suspected a terminal, character when he glanced round the semicircle of old ladies and found, them all staring at him. From the pain in his neck he knew that his head, had been hanging forward on his breast, and, in the strong belief that, he had been publicly disgracing himself, he left the place, and went out, on the piazza till his shame should be forgotten. Of course, the sound, of the name Desmond had been as much a part of his dream as the sight of, that pale girl's face; but he felt, while he paced the veranda, the pull, of a strong curiosity to make sure of the fact. From time to time he, looked in through the window, without courage to return. At last, when, the semicircle was reduced to the bulks of the two ladies who had sat, nearest him, he went in, and took a place with a newspaper at the lamp, just behind them.\\n\\nAt last he turned and walked back through the streets of dwellings to, the business centre of the town, where a gush of light came from the, veranda of his hotel, and the druggist's window cast purple and yellow, blurs out upon the footway. The other stores were shut, and he alone, seemed to be abroad. The church clock struck ten as he mounted the steps, of his hotel and dropped the remnant of his cigar over the side.\\n\\nand I added, with no great relevancy, that my wife and I were renewing, the fond emotion of our first trip down the St. Lawrence in the, character of bridal pair which we had spurned when it was really ours. I, explained that we had left the children with my wife's aunt, so as to, render the travesty more lifelike; and when he said, \\\"I suppose you miss, them, though,\\\" I gave him my card. He tried to find one of his own to, give me in return, but he could only find a lot of other people's cards., He wrote his name on the back of one, and handed it to me with a smile., \\\"It won't do for me to put 'reverend' before it, in my own chirography\\n\\nbut it could certainly be contrived, and he began to dramatize their, meeting on these various terms. It was interesting and it was, delightful, and it always came, in its safe impossibility, to his, telling her that he loved her, and to her consenting to be his wife. He, resolved to take no chance of losing her, but to remain awake, and, somehow see her before she could leave the hotel in the morning. The, resolution gave him calm; he felt that the affair so far was settled.\\n\\nwith a preoccupied air, to the open door where we stood waiting. There, were two great syringa-bushes on each hand close to the portal, which, were in full flower, and which flung their sweetness through the doorway, and the windows; but when we found ourselves in the dim old-fashioned, parlor, we were aware of this odor meeting and mixing with another which, descended from the floor above--the smell of some medicated pastille., There was a sound of anxious steps overhead, and a hurried closing of, doors, with the mechanical sound of labored breathing.\\n\\n\\\"She couldn't, I dare say, by any of the old romantic methods of a, convent or disinheritance; but she is an invalid; she wants to keep her, daughter with her, and she avails with the girl's conscience by being, simply dependent and obstructive. The young people have carried their, engagement through, and now such hope as they have is fixed upon her, finally yielding in the matter of their marriage, though Glendenning was, obliged to confess that there was no sign of her doing so. They, agree--Miss Bentley and he--that they cannot get married as they got, engaged, in spite of her mother--it would be unclerical if it wouldn't, be unfilial--and they simply have to bide their time.\\\"\\n\\nHe had not meant his politeness for an overture to her acquaintance, but, he felt as justly snubbed as if he had; and he sank back into his seat, in some disorder. He tried to hide his confusion behind the newspaper he, opened between them; but from time to time he had a glimpse of her round, the side of it, and he saw that the hand which clutched her bag all the, while tightened upon it and then loosened nervously.\\n\\n\\\"And, by-the-way,\\\" she added, with the logic of her sex, \\\"I'm just going, to the station to see what's become of a trunk myself that I ordered, expressed from Chicago a week ago. If you're not doing anything this, morning--the tide isn't in till noon, and there'll be little or no, bathing to look at before that--you'd better drive down with me. Or, perhaps you're canoeing up the river with somebody?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, nothing. Only, all at once I realized that he had a sensitive, nature. I don't know why I shouldn't have realized it before. I had, somehow taken it for granted that he was a self-conscious hermit, who, lived in a squalid seclusion because he liked being wondered at. But he, did not seem to be anything of the kind. I don't know whether he's a, good cook, for he didn't ask me to eat anything; but I don't think he's, a bad housekeeper.\\\"\\n\\nHe knew that the fact which their words veiled was now the first thing, in their mutual consciousness. He spoke the truth in saying, \\\"No, I, never wanted to,\\\" but this was only a mechanical truth, and he knew it., He had an impulse to put the burden of the situation on her, and press, her to say why she thought he wished to do so; but his next emotion was, shame for this impulse. A thousand times, in these reveries in which he, had imagined meeting her, he had told her first of all how he had, overheard her talking in the room next his own in the hotel, and of the, power her voice had instantly and lastingly had upon him. But now, with, a sense spiritualized by her presence, he perceived that this, if it was, not unworthy, was secondary, and that the right to say it was not yet, established. There was something that must come before this,--something, that could alone justify him in any further step. If she could answer, him first as he wished, then he might open his whole heart to her, at, whatever cost; he was not greatly to blame, if he did not realize that, the cost could not be wholly his, as he asked, remotely enough from her, question, \\\"After I wrote that I was coming up here, and you did not, answer me, did you think I was coming?\\\"\\n\\nLangbourne replied that he was going up to Springfield on business the, first week in May, and that he thought he might push on as far north as, Upper Ashton Falls. To this there came no rejoinder whatever, but he did, not lose courage. It was now the end of April, and he could bear to wait, for a further verification of his ideal; the photograph had confirmed, him in its evasive fashion at every point of his conjecture concerning, her. It was the face he had imagined her having, or so he now imagined\\n\\nGaites wondered why he felt suddenly angry; why he resented the head, waiter's blush as an impertinence and a liberty. After all, the fellow, was a student and probably a gentleman; and if he chose to help himself, through college by taking that menial role during the summer, rather, than come upon the charity of his friends or the hard-earned savings of, a poor old father, what had any one to say against it? Gaites had, nothing to say against it; and yet that blush, that embarrassment of a, man who had pulled out his chair for him, in relation to such a girl as, Miss Phyllis Desmond, incensed him so much that he could not enjoy his, supper. He did not bow to the head waiter when he held the netting-door, open for him to go out, and he felt the necessity of taking the evening, air in another stroll to cool himself off.\\n\\nI do not know whether she will live as long as her mother, who seems to, have taken a fresh lease of years from her single act of self-sacrifice., I cannot say whether Mrs. Bentley feels herself deceived and defrauded, by her daughter's recovery; but I have made my wife observe that it, would be just like life if she bore the young couple a sort of grudge, for unwittingly outwitting her. Certainly, on the day we lately spent, with them all at Gormanville, she seemed, in the slight attack of asthma, from which she suffered, to come as heavily and exactingly upon both as, she used to come upon her daughter alone. But I was glad to see that, Glendenning eagerly bore the greater part of the common burden. He grows, stouter and stouter, and will soon be the figure of a bishop.\\n\\nGaites found some notable changes in the hotel at Lower Merritt since he, had last sojourned there. It no longer called itself a Hotel, but an, Inn, and it had a brand-new old-fashioned swinging sign before its door;, its front had been cut up into several gables, and shingled to the, ground with shingles artificially antiquated, so that it looked much, grayer than it naturally ought. Within it was equipped for electric, lighting; and there was a low-browed aesthetic parlor, where, when Gaites, arrived and passed to a belated dinner in the dining-room, an orchestra\\n\\nthat the son of an older church than the Rixonite might have found in, this thoroughly terrestrial attitude of his wife a potent argument for, sacerdotal celibacy; but he did not attempt to formulate it, and he, listened submissively while she went on: \\\"_One_ thing: I am certainly, not going to let you see him again till you've seen the doctor, and I, hope he won't come about. If he does, _I_ shall see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm ready,\\\" said my wife, and she continued with her eyes still on the, glass: \\\"He's got a church out in Ohio, somewhere; but he's a, New-Englander, and he's quite wild to get back. He thinks those people, are from Boston: I could tell in a moment if I saw them. Well, now, I, _am_ ready,\\\" and with this she really ceased to do something to her, hair, and came out into the long saloon with me where the table was set., Rows of passengers stood behind the rows of chairs, with a detaining, grasp on nearly all of them. We gazed up and down in despair. Suddenly, Mrs. March sped forward, and I found that Mr. Glendenning had made a, sign to her from a distant point, where there were two vacant chairs for, us next his own. We eagerly laid hands on them, and waited for the gong, to sound for dinner. In this interval an elderly lady followed by a, young girl came down the saloon toward us, and I saw signs, or rather, emotions, of intelligence pass between Mr. Glendenning and Mrs. March, concerning them.\\n\\nthough he was not reticent about it. I proposed the history of his, cousin in the boyish days which he said they had spent together; but he, seemed no more interested in his cousin than in himself. Then I tried, his dog and his pathetic sufferings, and I said something about the pity, of the poor old fellow's last days being so miserable. That seemed to, strike a gleam of interest from him, and he asked me if I thought, animals might live again. And I found--I don't know just how to put it, so as to give you the right sense of his psychological attitude.\\\"\\n\\nThat night, before the Ewberts had finished their tea, there came a ring, at the door, from which Mrs. Ewbert disconsolately foreboded a premature, evening call. \\\"And just when I was counting on a long, quiet, restful, time for you, and getting you to bed early!\\\" she lamented in undertone, to her husband; to the maid who passed through the room with an, inquiring glance, to the front door, she sighed, still in undertone, \\\"Oh, yes, of course we're at _home_.\\\"\\n\\nThe young lady did not seem to care so much for this, and when she, thanked my wife in leaving the table with her mother, and begged her to, thank the gentlemen who had so kindly given up their places, she made no, overture to further acquaintance. In fact, we had been so simply and, merely made use of that, although we were rather meek people, we decided, to avoid our beneficiaries for the rest of the day; and Mr. Glendenning\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't be--impious, Basil,\\\" said my wife, with a moment's, hesitation for the word. Then she sighed and added, \\\"Yes, it seems as if, that would be the only thing that could end it. There doesn't really, seem to be any provision in life for ending such things. He will have to, go on and make more and more trouble. Poor man! I feel almost as sorry, for him as I do for her. I guess he hasn't expiated his sin yet, as, fully as he thinks he has.\\\"\\n\\nwith her hair of cloudy red and her large, dim-sighted eyes, it played, upon the spiritual sense within him with the coaxing, drolling, mocking, charm which he had felt from the first. It blessed him with intelligent, and joyous forgiveness. But as he stood at her gate that evening this, unmerited felicity fell from him. He now really heard her voice, through, the open doorway, but perhaps because it was mixed with other, voices--the treble of Miss Bingham, and the bass of a man who must be, the Mr. Dickery he had seen at the saw mills--he turned and hurried back, to his hotel, where he wrote a short letter saying that he had decided, to take the express for New York that night. With an instinctive, recognition of her authority in the affair, or with a cowardly shrinking, from direct dealing with Barbara, he wrote to Juliet Bingham, and he, addressed to her the packet of letters which he sent for Barbara., Superficially, he had done what he had no choice but to do. He had been, asked to return her letters, and he had returned them, and brought the, affair to an end.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see how you could have been more so!\\\" she retorted, in tender, indignation with him against himself. \\\"And I think what he said was, terrible. It was bad enough for him to pretend to believe that he was, not going to live again, but for him to tell you that he was _afraid_ he, was!\\\" An image sufficiently monstrous to typify Hilbrook's wickedness, failed to present itself to Mrs. Ewbert, and she went out to give the, maid instructions for something unusually nourishing for Ewbert at their, mid-day dinner. \\\"You look fairly fagged out, Clarence,\\\" she said, when, she came back; \\\"and I insist upon your not going up to that dreadful old, man's again,--at least, not till you've got over this shock.\\\"\\n\\nHe had not dwelt so long and so intently on the meeting at hand without, considering how he should account for his coming, and he had formulated, a confession of his motives. But he had never meant to make it to Juliet, Bingham, and he now found himself unable to allege a word in explanation, of his presence. He followed her into the parlor. Barbara silently gave, him her hand and then remained passive in the background, where Dickery, held aloof, smiling in what seemed his perpetual enjoyment of the Juliet, Bingham joke. She at once put herself in authority over the situation;, she made Langbourne let her have his hat; she seated him when and where, she chose; she removed and put back the lampshades; she pulled up and, pulled down the window-blinds; she shut the outer door because of the, night air, and opened it because of the unseasonable warmth within. She, excused Mrs. Simpson's absence on account of a headache, and asked him, if he would not have a fan; when he refused it she made him take it, and, while he sat helplessly dangling it from his hand, she asked him about, the summer he had had, and whether he had passed it in New York. She was, very intelligent about the heat in New York, and tactful in keeping the, one-sided talk from falling. Barbara said nothing after a few faint, attempts to take part in it, and Langbourne made briefer and briefer, answers. His reticence seemed only to heighten Juliet Bingham's, satisfaction, and she said, with a final supremacy, that she had been, intending to go out with Mr. Dickery to a business meeting of the, book-club, but they would be back before Langbourne could get away; she, made him promise to wait for them. He did not know if Barbara looked any, protest,--at least she spoke none,--and Juliet went out with Dickery., She turned at the door to bid Barbara say, if any one called, that she, was at the book-club meeting. Then she disappeared, but reappeared and, called, \\\"See here, a minute, Bab!\\\" and at the outer threshold she, detained Barbara in vivid whisper, ending aloud, \\\"Now you be sure to do, both, Bab! Aunt Elmira will tell you where the things are.\\\" Again she, vanished, and was gone long enough to have reached the gate and come, back from it. She was renewing all her whispered and out-spoken charges, when Dickery showed himself at her side, put his hand under her elbow\\n\\nThe older of these ladies was a tall, handsome matron, who bore her, fifty years with a native severity qualified by a certain air of wonder, at a world which I could well fancy had not always taken her at her own, estimate of her personal and social importance. She had the effect of, challenging you to do less, as she advanced slowly between the wall of, state-rooms and the backs of the people gripping their chairs, and eyed, them with a sort of imperious surprise that they should have left no, place for her. So at least I read her glance, while I read in that of, the young lady coming after, and showing her beauty first over this, shoulder and then over that of her mother, chiefly a present amusement\\n\\nseriously, to thank me for talking Glendenning out of his morbid mood., With the frankness sometimes characteristic of her she said that if he, had released her, it would have made no difference--she should still, have felt herself bound to him; and until he should tell her that he no, longer cared for her, she should feel that he was bound to her. I saw no, great originality in this reproduction of my own ideas. But when Miss, Bentley added that she believed her mother herself would be shocked and, disappointed if they were to give each other up, I was aware of being in, the presence of a curious psychological fact. I so wholly lost myself in, the inquiry it invited that I let the talk flow on round me unheeded, while I questioned whether Mrs. Bentley did not derive a satisfaction, from her own and her daughter's mutual opposition which she could never, have enjoyed from their perfect agreement. She had made a certain, concession in consenting to the engagement, and this justified her to, herself in refusing her consent to the marriage, while the ingratitude, of the young people in not being content with what she had done formed a, grievance of constant avail with a lady of her temperament. From what, Miss Bentley let fall, half seriously, half jokingly, as well as what I, observed, I divined a not unnatural effect of the strained relations, between her and her mother. She concentrated whatever resentment she, felt upon Miss Bentley, insomuch that it seemed as though she might, altogether have withdrawn her opposition if it had been a question, merely of Glendenning's marriage. So far from disliking him, she was, rather fond of him, and she had no apparent objection to him except as, her daughter's husband. It had not always been so; at first she had an, active rancor against him; but this had gradually yielded to his, invincible goodness and sweetness.\\n\\nand when she said she had not seen it, he sent it her; in one of her, letters she casually betrayed that she sang contralto in the choir, and, then he sent her some new songs, which he had heard in the theatre, and, which he had informed himself from a friend were contralto. He was, always tending to an expression of the feeling which swayed him; but on, her part there was no sentiment. Only in the fact that she was willing, to continue this exchange of letters with a man personally unknown to, her did she betray that romantic tradition which underlies all our young, life, and in those unused to the world tempts to things blameless in, themselves, but of the sort shunned by the worldlier wise. There was no, great wisdom of any kind in Miss Simpson's letters; but Langbourne did, not miss it; he was content with her mere words, as they related the, little events of her simple daily life. These repeated themselves from, the page in the tones of her voice and filled him with a passionate, intoxication.\\n\\nin the regret which the words conveyed. It appeared that it was not he, who had done the wrong; he had suffered it, and so far from having to, offer reparation to a young girl for having unwarrantably wrought her up, expect of him a step from which he afterwards recoiled, he had the duty, of forgiving her a trespass on his own invaded sensibilities. It was, humiliating to his vanity; it inflicted a hurt to something better than, his vanity. He began very uncomfortably: \\\"It's all right, as far as I'm, concerned. I had no business to address Miss Simpson in the first, place--\\\"\\n\\nhowever, she had gone down herself with Birkwall; and it showed what a, woman could do when she took anything in hand. Without knowing of her, approach except by telepathy, the railroad people had bestirred, themselves, and she had seen them with her own eyes put the piano-case, into a car, and had waited till the train had bumped and jolted off with, it towards Mewers Junction. All the ladies of her supper party, she, declared, had been keenly distressed at the delay of the piano in, Burymouth, and she was now offering him the relief which she had shared, already with them.\\n\\nAll the way back to New York Langbourne was oppressed by a sense of loss, such as his old disappointment in love now seemed to him never to have, inflicted. He found that his whole being had set toward the unseen owner, of the voice which had charmed him, and it was like a stretching and, tearing of the nerves to be going from her instead of going to her. He, was as much under duress as if he were bound by a hypnotic spell. The, voice continually sounded, not in his ears, which were filled with the, noises of the train, as usual, but in the inmost of his spirit, where it, was a low, cooing, coaxing murmur. He realized now how intensely he must, have listened for it in the night, how every tone of it must have, pervaded him and possessed him. He was in love with it, he was as, entirely fascinated by it as if it were the girl's whole presence, her, looks, her qualities. The remnant of the summer passed in the fret of, business, which was doubly irksome through his feeling of injury in, being kept from the girl whose personality he constructed from the sound, of her voice, and set over his fancy in an absolute sovereignty. The, image he had created of her remained a dim and blurred vision throughout, the day, but by night it became distinct and compelling. One evening\\n\\n\\\"I didn't approve of it, Basil; but if you felt so strongly that you, ought to do it, I felt that I ought to let you. I have never interfered, with your sense of duty, and I never will. But I am glad that you didn't, feel it your duty to that wretch to go and make more trouble on his, account. He has made quite enough already; and it wasn't his fault that, you were not tried and convicted in his place.\\\"\\n\\nThis was fortunate for Miss Desmond, who wished to talk of nothing else., The piano had arrived in perfect condition. \\\"But I don't know where the, poor thing _hasn't_ been, on the way,\\\" said the girl. \\\"It left Boston, fully two weeks ago, and it seems to have been wandering round to the, ends of the earth ever since. The first of last week, I heard from it at, Kent Harbor, of all places! I got a long despatch from there, from some, unknown female, telling me it had broken down on the way to Burymouth\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I fancy I was looking up the New York trains,\\\" Langbourne returned., He did not like these evasions, but in his consciousness of Miss Simpson, he seemed unable to avoid them. The clerk went out on the veranda to, talk with a farmer bringing supplies, and Langbourne ran to the, register, and read there the names of Barbara F. Simpson and Juliet D., Bingham. It was Miss Simpson who had registered for both, since her name, came first, and the entry was in a good, simple hand, which was like a, man's in its firmness and clearness. He turned from the register decided, to take the four-o'clock train for Upper Ashton Falls, and met a, messenger with a telegram which he knew was for himself before the boy, could ask his name. His partner had fallen suddenly sick; his recall was, absolute, his vacation was at an end; nothing remained for him but to, take the first train back to New York. He thought how little prescient, he had been in his pretence that he was looking the New York trains up;, but the need of one had come already, and apparently he should never, have any use for a train to Upper Ashton Falls.\\n\\nHe continued: \\\"I consider that I have expiated the wrong I did. There is, no sense in the whole thing, if I haven't. They might as well have let, me go in the beginning. Don't you think that ten years out of my life is, enough for a thing that I never intended to go as far as it did, and a, thing that I was led into, partly, for the sake of others? I have tried, to reason it out, and not from my own point of view at all, and that is, the way I feel about it. Is it to go on forever, and am I never to be, rid of the consequences of a single act? If you and Mr. March could, condone--\\\"\\n\\nOn a side track stood a freight-car, from which the customary men in, silk caps were pulling the freight, and standing it about loosely on the, platform. The car was detached from the parent train, which had left it, not only orphaned on this siding, but apparently disabled; for Gaites, heard the men talking about not having cut it out a minute too soon. One, of them called, in at the broad low door, to some one inside, \\\"All out?\\\", and a voice from far within responded, \\\"Case here, yet; _I_ can't handle, it alone.\\\"\\n\\nLangbourne went to bed as soon as he reached his hotel because he found, himself spent with the experience of the evening; but as he rested from, his fatigue he grew wakeful, and he tried to get its whole measure and, meaning before him. He had a methodical nature, with a necessity for, order in his motions, and he now balanced one fact against another none, the less passionately because the process was a series of careful, recognitions. He perceived that the dream in which he had lived for the, year past was not wholly an illusion. One of the girls whom he had heard, but not seen was what he had divined her to be: a dominant influence, a, control to which the other was passively obedient. He had not erred, greatly as to the face or figure of the superior, but he had given all, the advantages to the wrong person. The voice, indeed, the spell which, had bound him, belonged with the one to whom he had attributed it, and, the qualities with which it was inextricably blended in his fancy were, hers; she was more like his ideal than the other, though he owned that, the other was a charming girl too, and that in the thin treble of her, voice lurked a potential fascination which might have made itself, ascendently felt if he had happened to feel it first.\\n\\nThe wonder was that he should ever have been roused from his apathetic, unfaith to inquiry concerning the world beyond this, and to a certain, degree of belief in possibilities long abandoned by his imagination., Ewbert had assisted at the miracle of this resuscitation upon terms, which, until he was himself much older, he could not question as to, their beneficence, and in fact it never came to his being quite frank, with himself concerning them. He kept his thoughts on this point in that, state of solution which holds so many conjectures from precipitation in, actual conviction.\\n\\nI thought perhaps that she was in the habit from pride, or something, like it, of holding herself in check, and that this blameless excess, which I saw was the natural expansion from an inner constraint. But what, I really knew was that the young people got on very rapidly, in an, acquaintance that prospered up to the last moment I saw them together., This was just before the _Corinthian_ drew up to her landing at, Montreal, when Miss Bentley (we had learned her name) came to us from, the point where she was standing with Glendenning and said that now she, must go to her mother, and took a sweet leave of my wife. She asked, where we were going to stay in Montreal and whether we were going on to, Quebec; and said her mother would wish to send Mrs. March her card.\\n\\nThey both got by us, and I could see Mr. Glendenning following them with, longing but irresolute eyes, until they turned, a long way down the, saloon, as if to come toward us again. Then he hurried to meet them, and, as he addressed himself first to one and then to the other, I knew him, to be offering them his chair. So did my wife, and she said, \\\"You must, give up your place too, Basil,\\\" and I said I would if she wished to see, me starve on the spot. But of course I went and joined Glendenning in, his entreaties that they would deprive us of our chances of dinner (I, knew what the second table was on the _Corinthian_); and I must say that, the elder lady accepted my chair in the spirit which my secret grudge, deserved. She made me feel as if I ought to have offered it when they, first passed us; but it was some satisfaction to learn afterwards that, she gave Mrs. March, for her ready sacrifice of me, as bad a half-hour, as she ever had. She sat next to my wife, and the young lady took, Glendenning's place, and as soon as we had left them she began trying to, find out from Mrs. March who he was, and what his relation to us was., The girl tried to check her at first, and then seemed to give it up, and, devoted herself to being rather more amiable than she otherwise might, have been, my wife thought, in compensation for the severity of her, mother's scrutiny. Her mother appeared disposed to hold Mrs. March, responsible for knowing little or nothing about Mr. Glendenning.\\n\\nAt one time he had it on his tongue to say that there seemed to be, something like infection in his interest in that piano, and he was going, to speak of the young girl who seemed to share it, simply because she, saw him staring at it, and who faltered so long with him before the, freight-depot that she came near getting no seat in the train for, Burymouth. But just at that moment the dispute about the Ashwoods, renewed itself upon some fresh evidence which one of the ladies, recollected and offered; and Gaites's chance passed. When it came again, he had no longer the wish to seize it. A lingering soreness from his, experience with that young girl made itself felt in his nether, consciousness. He forbore the more easily because, mixed with this pain\\n\\nHe had not tried to characterize the university by his peculiar, religious faith, but he had given a church building, a parsonage, and a, fund for the support of preaching among them at Hilbrook to the small, body of believers to which his people adhered. This sect had a name by, which it was officially known to itself; but, like the Shakers, the, Quakers, the Moravians, it early received a nickname, which it passively, adopted, and even among its own members the body was rarely spoken of or, thought of except as the Rixonites.\\n\\nWhen her attack passed off, Mrs. Bentley sent and begged my wife to come, again and see her. She went without me, while I was in town, but she was, so circumstantial in her report of her visit, when I came home, that I, never felt quite sure I had not been present. What most interested us, both was the extreme independence which the mother and daughter showed, beyond a certain point, and the daughter's great frankness in expressing, her difference of feeling. We had already had some hint of this, the, first day we met her, and we were not surprised at it now, my wife at, first hand, or I at second hand. Mrs. Bentley opened the way for her, daughter by saying that the worst of sickness was that it made one such, an affliction to others. She lived in an atmosphere of devotion, she, said, but her suffering left her so little of life that she could not, help clinging selfishly to everything that remained.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said. \\\"It is Tedham,\\\" and I held out my hand, with no definite, intention, I believe, but merely because I did know him, and this was, the usual form of greeting between acquaintances after a long, separation, or even a short one, for that matter. But he seemed to find, a special significance in my civility, and he took my hand and held it, silently, while he was trying to speak. Evidently, he could not, and I, said aimlessly, \\\"What were you throwing at?\\\"\\n\\nlate in the fall, he could endure the stress no longer, and he yielded, to the temptation which had beset him from the first moment he renounced, his purpose of returning in person the circular addressed to her as a, means of her acquaintance. He wrote to her, and in terms as dignified as, he could contrive, and as free from any ulterior import, he told her he, had found it in the hotel hallway and had meant to send it to her at, once, thinking it might be of some slight use to her. He had failed to, do this, and now, having come upon it among some other papers, he sent, it with an explanation which he hoped she would excuse him for troubling, her with.\\n\\n\\\"Now, how unhandsome life is!\\\" I broke out, at one point on our way, home, after we had turned the affair over in every light, and then, dropped it, and then taken it up again. \\\"It's so graceless, so, tasteless! Why didn't Tedham die before the expiration of his term and, solve all this knotty problem with dignity? Why should he have lived on, in this shabby way and come out and wished to see his daughter? If there, had been anything dramatic, anything artistic in the man's nature, he, would have renounced the claim his mere paternity gives him on her love\\n\\nthe segment of a crescent eyebrow. The girl said that as they should, probably never meet, it was not necessary he should know her when he saw, her; she explained that she was looking away because she had been, attracted by something on the other side of the photograph gallery just, at the moment the artist took the cap off the tube of his camera, and, she could not turn back without breaking the plate.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course it will come right in time,\\\" said my wife when they were, gone, and I agreed that they need only have patience. We had all talked, ourselves into a cheerful frame concerning the affair; we had seen it in, its amusing aspects, and laughed about it; and that seemed almost in, itself to dispose of Mrs. Bentley's opposition. My wife and I decided, that this could not long continue; that by-and-by she would become tired, of it, and this would happen all the sooner if the lovers submitted, absolutely, and did nothing to remind her of their submission.\\n\\nWhat remained for him to do was to arrange for his departure by the, first train in the morning; and he was subjectively accounting to the, landlord for his abrupt change of mind after he had engaged his room for, a week, while he was intent with all his upper faculties upon the, graceful poses and movements of Miss Axewright. There was something so, appealing in the pressure of her soft chin as it held the violin in, place against her round, girlish throat that Gaites felt a lump in his, own larger than his Adam's-apple would account for to the spectator; the, delicately arched wrist of the hand that held the bow, and the, rhythmical curve and flow of her arm in playing, were means of the spell, which wove itself about him, and left him, as it were, bound hand and, foot. It was in this helpless condition that he rose at the urgence of a, friendly young fellow who had chosen himself master of ceremonies, and, took part in the dancing; and at the end of the first half of the, programme, while the other dancers streamed out on the verandas and, thronged the stairways, he was aware of dangling his chains as he, lounged toward the ladies of the orchestra. The volunteer master of, ceremonies had half shut himself across the piano in his eager talk with, Miss Desmond, and he readily relinquished Miss Axewright to Gaites, who, willingly devoted himself to her, after Miss Desmond had risen in, acknowledgment of his bow. He had then perceived that she was not nearly, so tall as she had seemed when seated; and a woman who sat tall and, stood low was as much his aversion as if his own abnormally long legs, did not render him guilty of the opposite offence.\\n\\npainted a wornout white, as far as it was solid, which was to the height, of one's shoulder; there it opened into a panel work of sticks crossed, X-wise, which wore a coat of aged green; the strip above them was set, with a bristling row of rusty nails, which were supposed to keep out, people who could perfectly well have gone in at the gate as we did., There was a brick walk from the gate to the door, which was not so far, back as I remembered it (perhaps because the leaves were now off the, trees), and there was a border of box on either side of the walk., Altogether there was an old-fashioned keeping in the place which I, should have rather enjoyed if I had been coming on any other errand; but, now it imparted to me a notion of people set in their ways, of something, severe, something hopelessly forbidding.\\n\\nat that early moment of her desolation. She had something of poor, Tedham's own style and grace, too, which had served him so ill, and this, heightened the pathos for me. In that figure I had thought of his, daughter ever since, as often as I had thought of her at all; which was, not very often, to tell the truth, after the first painful impression of, Tedham's affair began to die away in me, or to be effaced by the, accumulating cares and concerns of my own life. But now that we had, returned into the presence of that bitter sorrow, as it were, the little, thing reappeared vividly to me in just the way I had seen her so long, ago. My sense of her forlornness, of her most hapless orphanhood, was, intensified by the implacable hate with which Mrs. Hasketh had then, spoken of her father, in telling us that the child was henceforth to, bear her husband's name, and had resentfully scorned the merit Tedham, tried to make of giving her up to them. \\\"And if I can help it,\\\" she had, ended, with a fierceness I had never forgotten, \\\"she shall not hear him, mentioned again, or see him as long as I live.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thought there wa'n't much in it? Well, that's right, generally, speakin'. Folks like to make up stories about a man that lives alone, like me, here; and they usually get in a disappointment. I ain't goin', to go over it. I don't care any more about it now than if it had, happened to somebody else; but it did happen. Josiah got the girl, and I, didn't. I presume they like to make out that I've grieved over it ever, since. Sho! It's forty years since I gave it a thought, that way.\\\" A, certain contemptuous indignation supplanted the wonted gentleness of the, old man, as if he spurned the notion of such sentimental folly. \\\"I've, read of folks mournin' all their lives through, and in their old age, goin' back to a thing like that, as if it still meant somethin'. But it, ain't true; I don't suppose I care any more for losin' her now than, Josiah would for gettin' her if he was alive. It did make a difference, for a while; I ain't goin' to deny that. It lasted me four or five, years, in all, I guess; but I was married to somebody else when I went, to the war,\\\"--Ewbert controlled a start of surprise; he had always taken, it for granted that Hilbrook was a bachelor,--\\\"and we had one child. So, you may say that I was well over that first thing. _It wore out_; and if, it wa'n't that it makes me mad to have folks believin' that I'm, sufferin' from it yet, I presume I shouldn't think of it from one year's, end to another. My wife and I always got on well together; she was a, good woman. She died when I was away at the war, and the little boy died, after I got back. I was sorry to lose her, and I thought losin' _him_, would kill me. It didn't. It appeared one while as if I couldn't live, without him, and I was always contrivin' how I should meet up with him, somewhere else. I couldn't figure it out.\\\"\\n\\nSo it seemed to him in those flaccid moods to which Hilbrook's visits, left him, when mind and body were both spent in the effort he had been, making. In the intervals in which his strength renewed itself, he put, this fear from him as a hypochondriacal fancy, and he summoned a, cheerfulness which he felt less and less to meet the hopeful face of the, old man. Hilbrook had renewed himself, apparently, in the measure that, the minister had aged and waned. He looked, to Ewbert, younger and, stronger. To the conventional question how he did, he one night answered, that he never felt better in his life. \\\"But you,\\\" he said, casting an, eye over the face and figure of the minister, who lay back in his, easy-chair, with his hands stretched nerveless on the arms, \\\"_you_, look, rather peaked. I don't know as I noticed it before, but come to think, I, seemed to feel the same way about it when I saw you in the pulpit, yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we speak of Nature, we figure her as one thing, with a fixed, purpose and office in the universal economy; but she is an immense, number of things, and her functions are inexpressibly varied. She, includes decay as well as growth; she compasses death as well as birth., We call certain phenomena unnatural; but in a natural world how can, anything be unnatural, except the supernatural? These facts gave Ewbert, pause in view of the obstinate behavior of Ransom Hilbrook in dying for, no obvious reason, and kept him from pronouncing it unnatural. The old, man, he reflected, had really less reason to live than to die, if it, came to reasons; for everything that had made the world home to him had, gone out of it, and left him in exile here. The motives had ceased; the, interests had perished; the strong personality that had persisted was, solitary amid the familiar environment grown alien.\\n\\nHe did not know where Miss Simpson lived; and the courage with which he, had set out on his adventure totally lapsed, leaving in its place an, accusing sense of silliness. He was where he was without reason, and in, defiance of the tacit unwillingness of the person he had come to see;, she certainly had given him no invitation, she had given him no, permission to come. For the moment, in his shame, it seemed to him that, the only thing for him was to go back to New York by the first train in, the morning. But what then would the girl think of him? Such an act must, forever end the intercourse which had now become an essential part of, his life. That voice which had haunted him so long, was he never to hear, it again? Was he willing to renounce forever the hope of hearing it?\\n\\nI perceived that no moral scruple presented itself to him; when it came, to the point, he was simply and naturally a lover, like any other man;, and I persisted: \\\"It would only be a seven days' wonder. I never heard, of a clergyman's running away to be married; but they must have, sometimes done it. Come, I don't believe you'd have to plead hard with, Miss Bentley, and Mrs. March and I will aid and abet you to the limit of, our small ability. I'm sure that if I wrap up warm against the night, air, she will let me go and help you hold the rope-ladder taut.\\\"\\n\\nI thought that my wife, in the effusion of sympathy, would have perhaps, taken the girl in her arms; but probably she knew that the dropped veil, was a sign that there was to be no embracing. She put out her hand, and, the girl took it with her gloved hand; but though the outward forms of, their greeting were so cold, I fancied an instant understanding and, kindness between them.\\n\\n\\\"I believe you're thinking of making a sermon on that,\\\" she retorted;, and he gave a sad, consenting laugh, as if it were quite true, though in, fact he never really preached a sermon on mere femininity or mere, mortality. His sermons were all very good, however; and that was another, thing that put her out of patience with his Rixonite parishioners--that, they should sit there Sunday after Sunday, year in and year out, and, listen to his beautiful sermons, which ought to melt their hearts and, bring tears into their eyes, and not seem influenced by them any more, than if they were so many dry chips.\\n\\n\\\"There never is an end to a thing like this!\\\" she returned, with a, passionate sigh of pity. \\\"Oh, what a terrible thing an evil deed is! It, _can't_ end. It has to go on and on forever. Poor wretch! He thought he, had got to the end of his misdeed, when he had suffered the punishment, for it, but it was only just beginning then! Now, you see, it has a, perfectly new lease of life. It's as if it had just happened, as far as, the worst consequences are concerned.\\\"\\n\\nBy the time he arrived at Upper Ashton Falls the afternoon had waned so, far towards evening that the first robins were singing their vespers, from the leafless choirs of the maples before the hotel. He indulged the, landlord in his natural supposition that he had come up to make a timely, engagement for summer board; after supper he even asked what the price, of such rooms as his would be by the week in July, while he tried to, lead the talk round to the fact which he wished to learn.\\n\\nGaites was so furious when he got back to the smoking-room of the, parlor-car that he was sorry for several miles that he had not turned, back and kicked the man, even if it lost him his train. But this was, only while he was under the impression that he was furious with the man., When he discovered that he was furious with himself, for having been all, imaginable kinds of an ass, he perceived that he had done the wisest, thing he could in leaving the man to himself, and taking up the line of, his journey again. What remained mortifying was that he had bought his, ticket and checked his bag to Lower Merritt, which he wished never to, hear of again, much less see.\\n\\nNow he saw and understood at last that what his heart had more than once, misgiven him might be the truth, and that though she had sent back his, letters, and asked her own in return, it was not necessarily her wish, that he should obey her request. It might very well have been an, experiment of his feeling towards her, a mute quest of the impression, she had made upon him, a test of his will and purpose, an overture to a, clearer and truer understanding between them. This misgiving became a, conviction from which he could not escape.\\n\\nIf he had been younger, he would have had no doubt as to his right in, the circumstances. He had simply corresponded all winter with Miss, Simpson; but though he had opened his heart freely and had invited her, to the same confidence with him, he had not committed himself, and he, had a right to drop the whole affair. She would have no right to, complain; she had not committed herself either: they could both come off, unscathed. But he was now thirty-five, and life had taught him something, concerning the rights of others which he could not ignore. By seeking, her confidence and by offering her his, he had given her a claim which, was none the less binding because it was wholly tacit. There had been a, time when he might have justified himself in dropping the affair; that, was when she had failed to answer his letter; but he had come to see her, in defiance of her silence, and now he could not withdraw, simply, because he was disappointed, without cruelty, without atrocity.\\n\\n\\\"It was more like death. Several times I was on the point of going, but, you know when there's been a painful scene you feel so sorry for the, people who've made it that you can't bear to leave them to themselves. I, did get up to go, once, in mere self-defence, but they both urged me to, stay, and I couldn't help staying till they could talk of other things., But now tell me what you think of it all. Which should your feeling be, with the most? That is what I want to get at before I tell you mine.\\\"\\n\\nand if possible our help, in a matter about which she had already, consulted the doctor. \\\"The doctor says that the excitement cannot hurt, Edith; it may even help her, to propose it. I should like to do it, but, if you do not think well of it, I will not do it. I know it is too late, now to make up to her for the past,\\\" said Mrs. Bentley, and here she, gave way to the grief she had restrained hitherto.\\n\\nHe believed too late that he had made a mistake, that he had thrown away, the supreme chance of his life. But was it too late? When he could bear, it no longer, he began to deny that it was too late. He denied it even, to the pathetic presence which haunted him, and in which the magic of, her voice itself was merged at last, so that he saw her more than he, heard her. He overbore her weak will with his stronger will, and set, himself strenuously to protest to her real presence what he now always, said to her phantom. When his partner came back from his vacation\\n\\n\\\"Wait a moment,\\\" cried Juliet Bingham, and she gulped the last draught, of her lemonade upon a final morsel of sponge-cake, and was down at the, piano while still dusting the crumbs from her fingers. She struck the, refractory sheet of music flat upon the rack with her palm, and then, tilted her head over her shoulder towards Langbourne, who had risen with, some vague notion of turning the sheets of the song. \\\"Do you sing?\\\"\\n\\nconclusions, in which there was nothing final but the decision that we, must not dream of going there; that it would look like thrusting, ourselves in, and would be in the worst sort of taste; they would all, hate us, and we should feel that we were spies upon the young people;, for of course the Bentleys had got Glendenning there to marry him, and, in effect did not want any one to witness the disgraceful spectacle.\\n\\nMrs. Ewbert broke down in her turn. \\\"I don't know _what_ I'm saying!\\\", she retorted from behind her handkerchief. \\\"I'm trying to show you that, it's your duty to yourself--and to me--and to people who can know how to, profit by your teaching and your example, not to give way as you're, doing, simply because a wornout old agnostic couldn't keep his hold on, the truth. I don't know what your Rixonitism is for if it won't let you, wait upon the divine will in such a thing, _too_. You're more, conscientious than the worst kind of Congregationalist. And now for you, to blame me\\\"--\\n\\nHe said, Oh, he should be so happy; and he gathered his dangling map, into the book and came over with me to where Mrs. March sat; and, like, the good young American husband I was in those days, I stood aside and, left the whole talk to her. She interested him so much more than I could, that I presently wandered away and amused myself elsewhere. When I came, back, she clutched my arm and bade me not speak a word; it was the most, romantic thing in the world, and she would tell me about it when we were, alone, but now I must go off again; he had just gone to get a book for, her which he had been speaking of, and would be back the next instant\\n\\nIt was not very reverent to his cloth, or his recent tragical mood, but, Glendenning was not offended; he laughed with a sheepish pleasure, and, that evening he came with Miss Bentley to call upon us. The visit passed, without unusual confidences until they rose to go, when she said, abruptly to me: \\\"I feel that we both owe you a great deal, Mr. March., Arthur has been telling me of your talk this afternoon, and I think that, what you said was all so wise and true! I don't mean,\\\" she added, \\\"your, suggestion about putting an end to the anomaly!\\\" and she and Glendenning, both laughed.\\n\\n\\\"It bound you from your first acknowledgment of it, and unless you could, deny your love now, or hereafter, it must always bind you. If you own, that you still love each other, you are still engaged, no matter how, much you release each other. Could you think of loving her and marrying, some one else? Could she love you and marry another? There isn't any, error, unless you've mistaken your feeling for each other. If you have\\n\\nHilbrook was a farmer, so far as he was anything industrially, and, Ewbert tried him with questions of crops, soils, and fertilizers; but he, tried him in vain. The old man said he had never cared much for those, things, and now it was too late for him to begin. He generally sold his, grass standing, and his apples on the trees; and he had no animals about, the place except his chickens,--they took care of themselves. Ewbert, urged, for the sake of conversation, even of a disputative character\\n\\nMy wife looked at me with a glance in which I saw tender affection, dangerously near contempt. \\\"You are a very forgiving man, Basil,\\\" she, said, and I looked down sheepishly. \\\"Well, at any rate, you have had the, sense not to mix yourself up in his business. Did he pretend that he, came straight to you, as soon as he got out? I suppose he wanted you to, believe that he appealed to you before he tried anybody else.\\\"\\n\\nand to bear and share with him. You see it was a great mistake not to, prepare the child for it sooner, and tell her just when Tedham would be, out, so that if she wanted to see him she could. She thinks she ought to, have been there at the prison waiting to speak to him the first one. I, thought it was a mistake to have her away, and I guess that's the way, Mrs. Hasketh looks at it herself, now.\\\"\",\n          \"Did I tell you that I had been to the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race?, But I have paragraphed it in the _Nation_, to which I refer you. It was, for about two minutes a supremely beautiful sight; but for those two, minutes I had to wait a horribly bleak hour and a half, shivering, in, mid-Thames, under the sour March-wind. I can't think of any other, adventures: save that I dined two or three days since at Mrs. Godfrey, Lushington's (they are very nice _blushing_ people) with a parcel of, quiet folk: but next to a divine little Miss Lushington (so pretty, English girls can be!) who told me that she lived in the depths of the, City, at Guy's Hospital, whereof her father is administrator. Guy's, Hospital--of which I have read in all old English novels. So does one, move all the while here on identified ground. This is the eve of Good, Friday, a most lugubrious day here--and all the world (save 4,000,000 or, so) are out of London for the ten days' Easter holiday. I think of, making two or three excursions of a few hours apiece, to places near, London whence I can come back to sleep: Canterbury, Chichester etc. (but, as I shall commemorate them for lucre I won't talk of them thus).\\n\\nand I sometimes feel tempted to retire to some frugal village, for, twelve months, where, my current expenses being inconsiderable, I might, have leisure to work them off. Even if I could only find some manager or, publisher sufficiently devoted to believe in this and make me an, allowance for such a period, I would afterwards make a compact and sign, it with my blood, to reimburse him in thousands. But I shall not have to, come to this, or to depend upon it.\\n\\n, I return with much appreciation the vivid pages on Pater. They fill up, substantially the void of one's ignorance of his personal history, and, they are of a manner graceful and luminous; though I should perhaps, have relished a little more insistence on--a little more of an inside, view of--the nature of his mind itself. Much as they tell, however, how, curiously negative and faintly-grey he, after all telling, remains! I, think he has had--will have had--the most exquisite literary fortune:, i.e. to have taken it out all, wholly, exclusively, with the pen (the, style, the genius,) and absolutely not at all with the person. He is the, mask without the face, and there isn't in his total superficies a tiny, point of vantage for the newspaper to flap his wings on. You have been, lively about him--but about whom _wouldn't_ you be lively? I think you'd, be lively about _me_!--Well, faint, pale, embarrassed, exquisite Pater!, He reminds me, in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature, of, one of those lucent matchboxes which you place, on going to bed, near, the candle, to show you, in the darkness, where you can strike a light:, he shines in the uneasy gloom--vaguely, and has a phosphorescence, not a, flame. But I quite agree with you that he is not of the little day--but, of the longer time.\\n\\nI interrupted this a couple of hours since to go out and pay a visit to, Gustave Flaubert, it being his time of receiving, and his last Sunday in, Paris, and I owing him a farewell. _He_ is a very fine old fellow, and, the most interesting man and strongest artist of his circle. I had him, for an hour alone, and then came in his \\\"following,\\\" talking much of, Emile Zola's catastrophe--Zola having just had a serial novel for which, he was handsomely paid interrupted on account of protests from, provincial subscribers against its indecency. The opinion apparently was, that it was a bore, but that it could only do the book good on its, appearance in a volume. Among your tribulations as editor, I take it, that this particular one is not in store for you. On my way down from, Flaubert's I met poor Zola climbing the staircase, looking very pale and, sombre, and I saluted him with the flourish natural to a contributor who, has just been invited to make his novel last longer yet....\\n\\nThis will reach you about Xmas-time, and I imagine you reading it at a, window that looks out upon the snow-laden pines and hemlocks of Shady, Hill. That white winter light that is sent up into a room from the deep, snow is something that one quite loses the memory of here; and yet, as I, think of it now, it is associated in my mind with all kinds of pleasant, and comfortable indoor scenes. I am afraid that, for you, the season, will have no great animation; but you will, I suppose, see a good deal, of infantine exhilaration about you....\\n\\n, Nothing more delightful, or that has touched me more closely, even to, the spring of tears, has befallen me for years, literally, than to, receive your beautiful letter of Nov. 30th, so largely and liberally, anent _The W. of the D._ Every word of it goes to my heart and to, \\\"thank\\\" you for it seems a mere grimace. The same post brought me a, letter from dear John Hay, so that my measure has been full. I haven't, known anything about the American \\\"notices,\\\" heaven save the mark! any, more than about those here (which I am told, however, have been, remarkably genial;) so that I have _not_ had the sense of confrontation, with a public more than usually childish--I mean had it in any special, way. I confess, however, that that is my chronic sense--the more than, usual childishness of publics: and it is (has been,) in my mind, long, since discounted, and my work definitely insists upon being independent, of such phantasms and on unfolding itself wholly from its own \\\"innards.\\\", Of course, in our conditions, doing anything decent is pure, disinterested, unsupported, unrewarded heroism; but that's in the day's, work. The _faculty of attention_ has utterly vanished from the general, anglo-saxon mind, extinguished at its source by the big blatant, _Bayadere_ of Journalism, of the newspaper and the _picture_ (above all), magazine; who keeps screaming \\\"Look at _me_, _I_ am the thing, and I, only, the thing that will keep you in relation with me _all the time_, without your having to attend _one minute_ of the time.\\\" If you are, moved to write anything anywhere about the _W. of the D._ do say, something of that--it so awfully wants saying. But we live in a lovely, age for literature or for any art but the mere visual. Illustrations\\n\\n, I think I should manifest an energy more becoming a child of yours if I, were to sustain my nodding head at least enough longer to scrawl the, initial words of my usual letter: we are travellers in the midst of, travel. You heard from me last at Innsbruck--or rather, I think, at, Botzen, just before, a place beautiful by nature but most ugly by man;, and [we] came by an admirable five hours' run through the remnant of the, Tyrol to Munich, where we spent two rather busy days. It's a singular, place and one difficult to write of with a serious countenance. It has a, fine lot of old pictures, but otherwise it is a nightmare of pretentious, vacuity: a city of chalky stucco--a Florence and Athens in canvas and, planks. To have come [thither] from Venice is a sensation! We found, reality at last at Nueremburg, by which place, combined with this, it, seemed a vast pity not to proceed rather than by stupid Stuttgart., Nueremburg is excellent--and comparisons are odious; but I would give a, thousand N.'s for one ray of Verona! We came on hither by a morning and, noon of railway, which has not in the least prevented a goodly afternoon, and evening at the Castle here. The castle (which I think you have all, seen in your own travels) is an incomparable ruin and holds its own, against any Italian memories. The light, the weather, the time, were, all, this evening, most propitious to our visit. This rapid week in, Germany has filled us with reflections and observations, tossed from, the railway windows on our course, and irrecoverable at this late hour., To me this hasty and most partial glimpse of Germany has been most, satisfactory; it has cleared from my mind the last mists of uncertainty, and assured me that I can never hope to become an unworthiest adoptive, grandchild of the fatherland. It is well to listen to the voice of the, spirit, to cease hair-splitting and treat one's self to a good square, antipathy--when it is so very sympathetic! I may 'cultivate' mine away\\n\\nHe had intended Lamb House to be a retreat from the pressure of the, world, but it need hardly be said that from the first it was thrown open, to his friends with hospitable freedom. In the matter of entertainment, his standard again was munificently high, and the consequences it, entailed were sometimes weightier than he found to his liking. But once, more it is necessary to read his laments over his violated hermitage, with many reserves. Lonely as he was in his work, he was not made for, any other kind of solitude; he needed companionship, and soon missed it, when it was withdrawn. After a few experiments he discovered that the, isolation of the winter at Rye by no means agreed with him; for the, short days and long evenings he preferred Pall Mall, where (after, letting his flat in Kensington) he engaged a permanent lodging at the, Reform Club. He could thus divide the year as he chose between London, and Rye, and the arrangement was so much to his liking that in five, years he made only one long absence from home. In 1899 he returned again, to Italy for the summer, paying a visit on the way to M. and Mme., Bourget at Hyeres. At Rome many associations were recalled for him by a, suggestion that he should write the life of William Wetmore Story, his, friend and host of twenty years before--a suggestion carried out, somewhat later in a book filled, as he said, with the old Roman, gold-dust of the seventies. He brought back new impressions also from a, visit to Mrs. Humphry Ward at Castel Gandolfo--where she and her family, were spending some weeks at the Villa Barberini, on the ridge between, the Roman Campagna and the Alban lake--and another to Marion Crawford at, Sorrento. He stayed briefly at Florence and Venice, and returned home to, find a special reason awaiting him for renewed application to work. He, had taken Lamb House on a lease, but the death of its owner now made it, necessary to decide whether he should purchase it outright. He paid the, price without hesitation; he was by this time deeply attached to the, place and he seized the chance of making it his own. The earnings of his, work would not go far towards paying for it, but he felt it all the more, urgent to concentrate upon production for some time to come. He did not, leave England again till four years later, nor his own roof for more, than a few days now and then.\\n\\nThe second Henry James has left so full and vivid a portrait of his, father that it is unnecessary to dwell on the happy influences under, which the family passed their youth. The 'ideas' of the head of the, house, as his remote speculations were familiarly known at home, lay, outside the range of his second son; but in the preface to a collection, of papers, posthumously issued in 1884, they are sympathetically, expounded and appraised by William James, whose adventurous mind\\n\\nwhen he was still working upon the book, \\\" ...and to understand the, English character, or at least the mind, as well as if I had invented, it--which indeed,\\\" he adds lightly, \\\"I think I could have done without, any very extraordinary expenditure of ingenuity.\\\" The end of the summer, of 1888 was spent in an hotel at Torquay, which became one of his, favourite retreats; and later in the autumn he was for a short while, abroad, at Geneva and Paris, with a flying dip into Northern Italy. The, letter to his brother, written from Geneva, with which this section, closes, lucidly sums up the conclusions he had by now drawn from the, experience of a dozen years of England. At the age of forty-five he, could feel that he had exhausted the study of the old international, distinctions, English and American, that had engaged him for so long. He, was indeed to return to them again, later on, and to devote to them the, final elaboration of his art; but that lay far ahead, and now for many, years he faced in other directions.\\n\\npersonally, his books, and this last re-placement of himself so _en, scene_ (so largely by his own aid, too) has _killed_ the literary, baggage. Out of no mystery now do they issue, the creations in, question--and they couldn't afford to lose it. Louis himself never, understood that; he too publicly caressed and accounted for them--but I, needn't insist on what I mean. As I _see_ it, at all events, it's a, strange little evolution and all taking place here, quite compactly\\n\\nHis recollections of childhood began, surprisingly enough, when he was, little more than a year old. In the summer of 1844 the parents carried, their two infants, William and Henry, for a visit to Europe, an, adventure not altogether lost upon the younger; for he actually retained, an impression of Paris, a glimpse of the Place Vendome, to be the, foundation of all his European experience. His earliest American, memories were of Albany; but the family were soon established in, Fourteenth Street, New York, which was their home for some ten years, a, settlement only broken by family visits and summer weeks by the sea. The, children's extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous education went, forward under various teachers, their father's erratic rule having, apparently but one principle, that they should stay nowhere long enough, to receive any formal imprint. To Henry at least their schooling meant, nothing whatever but the opportunity of conducting his own education in, his own way, and he made the utmost of the easy freedom they enjoyed. He, was able to stare and brood to his heart's content, and thus to feed his, imagination on the only pasturage it required.\\n\\nis rather amusing--as amusing as anything can be, for a man of taste and, sensibility, in the odious process of practical dramatic production. I, may have been meant for the Drama--God knows!--but I certainly wasn't, meant for the Theatre. C'est pour vous dire that I am much pressed and, am only sending you mes voeux tres-sinceres in a shabbily brief little, letter. There are a number of interesting things in your last to which I, want to respond. I send you also by post 3 or 4 miserable little (old), views of Tunbridge Wells, which I have picked up in looking, at rare, leisure moments, for one good one for you. I haven't, alas, found that;, but I think I am on the track of it, and you shall have it as soon as it, turns up. Accept these meanwhile as a little stop-gap and a symbol of my, New Year's greeting.... I hope you are in good case and good hope. We, are having here an excellent winter, almost fogless and generally, creditable. Write me a little word of hope and help for the 5th; I shall, regard it as a happy influence for yours forever\\n\\nI brood with mingled elation and depression on your ingenious, your, really inspired, suggestion that I shall give you a ghost, and that my, ghost shall be \\\"international.\\\" I say inspired because, singularly, enough, I set to work some months ago at an international ghost, and on, just this scale, 50,000 words; entertaining for a little the highest, hopes of him. He was to have been wonderful and beautiful; he was to, have been called (perhaps too metaphysically) \\\"The Sense of the Past\\\";, and he was to have been supplied to a certain Mr ---- who was then, approaching me--had then approached me.... The outstretched arm\\n\\n, I send you by this post the sheets of that little tribute to your genius, which I spoke of to you so many months ago and which appears in the, _Century_ for May. The magazine is not yet out, or I would send you, that, and the long delay makes my article so slight in itself, rather, an impotent conclusion. Let me hasten to assure you that the \\\"London, Society\\\", tacked to the title, is none of my doing, but that of the, editors of the Magazine, who put in an urgent plea for it. Such as my, poor remarks are, I hope you will find in them nothing disagreeable, but, only the expression of an exceeding friendliness. May my blessing go, with them and a multitude of good wishes!\\n\\nhave held up our head. It had been long, before that, since any decent, sentence was turned in English. We grow systematically vulgarer and, baser. The only blur of light is that your books are tasted. I shall try, to see Colvin before I post this--otherwise I haven't seen him for three, months. I've had a summer of the British seaside, the bathing machine, and the German band. I met Zola at luncheon the day before he left, London and found him very sane and common and inexperienced. Nothing\\n\\nas I have \\\"fixed\\\" it, a more truly curious and interesting, drama--especially a more human one. _But_, as I say, there are the, necessities of space, as to which I have a dread of deluding myself only, to find that by trying to blink them I shall be grossly \\\"sold,\\\" or by, giving way to them shall positively spoil my form for your purpose. The, hitch is that the thing involves a devil of a sort of prologue or, preliminary action--interesting itself and indispensable for, lucidity--which impinges too considerably (for brevity) on the core of, the subject. My one chance is yet, I admit, to try to attack the same, (the subject) from still another quarter, at still another angle, that I, make out as a possible one and which may keep it squeezable and short., If this experiment fails, I fear I shall have to \\\"chuck\\\" the, supernatural and the high fantastic. I have just finished, as it, happens, a fine flight (of eighty thousand words) _into_ the high, fantastic, which has rather depleted me, or at any rate affected me as, discharging my obligations in that quarter. But I believe I mentioned to, you in my last \\\"The Sacred Fount\\\"--this has been \\\"sold\\\" to Methuen here\\n\\nand these bushy ornaments had the effect of making him in a sense,      shadowy. Almost every afternoon he took a walk with me, rarely with,      Sargent, never with the sedentary rest; these walks were long in,      time but not in distance, for Henry was inclined to saunter. He had,      not wholly recovered from that weakness of the muscles of his back,      which had so long troubled him, and I suppose that this was the,      cause of a curious stiffness in his progress, which proceeded,      rather slowly. He had certain preferences, in particular for the,      level road through the green landscape to the ancient grey village,      of Aston Somerville. He always made the same remark, as if he had,      never noticed it before, that Aston was \\\"so Italian, so Tuscan.\\\"\\n\\n, I have, as usual, endless unacknowledged benefits to thank you for after, too many days. The last is your letter of the end of March, full of, interesting substance as always and of things that no one else has the, imagination or the inspiration to tell me. (My allusion to the, imagination there is not, believe me, an imputation on your exactitude., The light of truth, of good solid vivid Boston truth, shines in each of, your pages.) Especially are you interesting and welcome, as I have told, you before, I think, on the young generations and full-blown, though, new, existences, that are in possession of a scene I knew as otherwise, occupied. All the old names--or most of them--appear to be represented, by the remote posterity of my old acquaintance. In this remote, posterity, however, I take an interest--and scraps and specimens of it\\n\\nat all; I mean as to the general complexity of life. His _Ballad_ future, may still be big. But my view of his prose future has much shrunken in, the light of one's increasingly observing how little of life he can make, use of. Almost nothing civilised save steam and patriotism--and the, latter only in verse, where I _hate_ it so, especially mixed up with, God and goodness, that that half spoils my enjoyment of his great, talent. Almost nothing of the complicated soul or of the female form or, of any question of _shades_--which latter constitute, to my sense, the, real formative literary discipline. In his earliest time I thought he, perhaps contained the seeds of an English Balzac; but I have quite given, that up in proportion as he has come steadily from the less simple in, subject to the more simple--from the Anglo-Indians to the natives, from, the natives to the Tommies, from the Tommies to the quadrupeds, from the, quadrupeds to the fish, and from the fish to the engines and screws....\\n\\nhowever, which I endeavour more and more to keep, if possible, within, the compass of _hours_. The gilded bondage of the country house becomes, onerous as one grows older, and then the waste of time in vain sitting, and strolling about is a gruesome thought in the face of what one still, wants to do with one's remnant of existence. I saw Matt Arnold the other, night, and he spoke very genially of you and of his visit to, Ashfield--very _affectionately_, too, of George Curtis--which I loudly, echoed. M. A. said of Stockbridge and the summer life thereabouts, etc., (with his chin in the air)--\\\"Yes, yes--it's a proof that it's attaching, that one thinks of it again--one thinks of it again.\\\" This was amiably, sublime and amiably characteristic.--I see Burne-Jones from time to, time, but not as often as I should like. I am always so afraid of, breaking in on his work. Whenever he is at home he is working and when, he isn't working he's not at home. When I _do_ see him, it is one of the, best human pleasures that London has for me. But I don't understand his, life--that is the manner and tenor of his production--a complete, _studio_ existence, with doors and windows closed, and no search for, impressions outside--no open air, no real daylight and no looking out, for it. The things he does in these conditions have exceeding, beauty--but they seem to me to grow colder and colder--pictured, abstractions, less and less observed. Such as he is, however, he is, certainly the most distinguished artistic figure among Englishmen, to-day--the only one who has escaped vulgarization and on whom claptrap, has no hold. Moreover he is, as you know, exquisite in mind and, talk--and we fraternize greatly....\\n\\nwhich fortunately shines, and giving myself up to the sweet sense of, living once more--after an interval of several years--in the adorable, country it illumines. It is Sunday and all the world is in the streets, and squares, and the Italian type greets me in all its handsomeness and, friendliness, and also, I fear I must add, not a little in its, vulgarity. But its vulgarity is the exaggeration of a merit and not, as, in England and the U.S., of a defect. Churches and galleries have such a, fatal chill that being sore-throatish and neuralgic I have had to keep, out of them, but the Duomo lifts all its pinnacles and statues into the, far away light, and looks across at the other white needles and spires, of the Alps in the same bewildering cluster. I go to spend the remainder, of this month in Florence and afterwards to--I hope--take a month, between Rome, Naples and Venice--but it will be as it will turn out., Once I am in Italy it is about the same to me to be in one place as in, another.\\n\\nI suppose, with the genial Bob! May you be floated grandly over your, cataract--by which I don't mean have any manner of fall, but only be a, Niagara of eloquence, all continuously, whether above or below the, rapids. You will send me, I devoutly hope, some report of the whole, thing. It affects me much even at this distance and in this so grossly, alien air--this overt dedication of dear old Emerson to his immortality., I hope all the attendant circumstances will be graceful and beautiful. I, came back hither as I believe I have mentioned, some six days ago, after, some 18 weeks in London, which went, this time, very well, and were very, easy, on my present extremely convenient basis, to manage. The Spring, here, till within a week, has been backward and blighted; but Summer has, arrived at last with a beautiful jump, and Rye is quite adorable in its, outbreak of greenery and blossom. I never saw it more lovely than, yesterday, a supreme summer (early summer) Sunday. The dear little charm, of the place at such times consoles me for the sordid vandalisms that, are rapidly disfiguring and that I fear will soon quite destroy it., Another scare for me just now is the threatened destruction of the two, little charmingly-antique silver-grey cottages on the right of the, little vista that stretches from my door to the church--the two that you, may remember just beyond my garden wall, and in one of which my gardener, has lately been living. They will be replaced, if destroyed, by a pair, of hideous cheap modern workingman's cottages--a horrid inhuman stab at, the very heart of old Rye. There is a chance it may be still, averted--but only just a bare chance. One would buy them, in a moment\\n\\nalways, as through a company of ghosts, so completely have sound and, sight of individuals and presences faded away from me. Still, I _have_, had some close reminders. Wendell Holmes was here, still beautiful and, charming, for a day or two, and above all, off and on, for a couple of, months my nephew Harry, whom you well know, and in whom I took no end of, comfort and pleasure. His being here was a great satisfaction to me--and, doubled by the fact of my so getting more news of William and Alice than, I have had for many a year. She sent to the boy all his father's letters, from California and elsewhere--the consequence of which, for me, was a, wonderful participation and interest. William appears to have had a, magnificent sort of summer and no end of success on the Pacific, slope--besides innumerable impressions by the way and an excellent, series of weeks in the Adirondacks before going forth. But after all\\n\\n, It's a great pleasure to hear from you in this far country--though I, greatly wish it weren't from the bed of anguish--or at any rate of, delicacy: if delicacy may be connected, that is, with anything so, indelicate as a bed! But I'm very glad to gather that it's the couch of, convalescence. Only, if you have a Back, for heaven's sake take care of, it. When I was about your age--in 1862!--I did a bad damage (by a strain, subsequently--through crazy juvenility--neglected) to mine; the, consequence of which is that, in spite of retarded attention, and years\\n\\n1895, with George Alexander and Miss Marion Terry in the chief parts., The story of this unfortunate venture is to be read in the letters that, follow. The play (which has never been published) was enthusiastically, received by the few and roughly rejected by the many; it ran for exactly, a month and then disappeared for good. It was the most ambitious, and no, doubt the best, piece of dramatic work that Henry James had produced\\n\\nI lately spent a number of months in America, after a long absence, but, I live in London and have put my constant address at the top of my, letter. I imagine that it is scarcely ever in your power to come to, England, but do take note of my whereabouts, for this happy (and, possibly, to you, ideal) contingency. I should very much like to see, you--but I go little, nowadays, to Switzerland in summer (though at one, time I was there a good deal). I think it possible moreover that at that, season you get out of your Alps. I certainly should, in your place, for, the Alps are easily too many for me.--I can well imagine the innumerable, things you miss at Davos--year after year--and (I will say it) I think, of you with exceeding sympathy. As a sign of that I shall send you, everything I publish.\\n\\nthough it developed on quite other lines. It is natural to speak of the, father as a Swedenborgian, for the writings of Swedenborg had been the, chief source of his inspiration and supplied the tincture of his, thought. He did not, however, himself admit this description of his, point of view, which indeed was original and unconventional to the last, degree. It was directed towards an ideal, to use William James's words\\n\\nDrama--tableau! My dear Tony, you are literally my saviour. The above, row of stars represents midnight emotions and palpitations of no mean, order. As I finished the line just before the stars I became aware that, a smell of smoke, a sense of burning that had worried me for the, previous hour, had suddenly very much increased and that the room was, full of it. _De fil en aiguille_, and in much anxiety, I presently, discovered that the said smoke was coming up through the floor between, the painted dark-green planks (_dark_ green!) of the margin--outside of, matting and rugs, and under a table near the fireplace. To assure myself, that there was no source of flame in the room below, and then to go up, and call my servant, do you see? (he long since snoring in bed--for it's, now 2.15 a.m.) was the work of a moment. With such tools as we could, command we hacked and pried and sawed and tore up a couple of, planks--from which volumes of smoke issued!! Do you see the midnight, little flurry? Bref, we got _at_ it--a charred\\n\\nagainst many, many long years of London, which has ended by giving me a, deep sense of the quantity of \\\"cry\\\" in all that life compared to the, almost total absence of \\\"wool.\\\" By which I mean, simply, that, acquaintances and relations there have a way of seeming at last to end, in smoke--while having consumed a great deal of fuel and taken a great, deal of time. I dare say I shall some day re-establish the balance, and, I have kept my habitation there, though I let it whenever I can; but at, present I am as conscious of the advantage of the Sussex winter as of, that of the Sussex summer. But I've just returned from three days in, London, mainly taken up with seeing my brother William as to whom your, letter contained an anxious inquiry to which I ought before this to have, done justice. The difficulty has been, these three months, that he has, been working, with the most approved medical and \\\"special\\\" aid, for a, change of condition, which one hoped would have been apparent by now--so, that one might have good news to give. I am sorry to say the change, remains, as yet, but imperfectly apparent--though I dare say it has\\n\\nto my infinite chagrin. I should have seen it well from my balcony, as I, should have been at home when it passed, and it smashed the windows in, the houses (three doors from mine) on the corner of Bolton St. and, Piccadilly. Alice was all unconscious of it till the morrow, and was, not at all agitated. The wreck and ruin in Piccadilly and some other, places (I mean of windows) was, on my return from Bournemouth\\n\\n, I respond with joy to your suggestion in your beautiful letter of two, days ago--that I shall enable you to find a word from me on your table, on the darkest a. m. of the year; in the first place because I am much, touched by your attaching to any word of mine any power to comfort or, charm; and in the second because I can well measure--by my own--your, sense of a melancholy from which you must appeal. It is indeed a, lugubrious feast and a miserable merriment. But it is something to spend, the evil season by one's own poor hearthstone (save that yours is, opulent), crouching over the embers and chuckling low over all the, dreadful places where one is not! I've been literally pressed to go to, two or three--one of them in Northumberland! (the cheek of some people!), and the reflection that I _might_ be there and yet by heaven's mercy am, not, does give a faint blush as of the rose to my otherwise deep, depression. It is a mild, gray, rainless, sunless inoffensive sort of, Xmas here--and the shop fronts look rather prettily pink and green and, golden in the dear dirty old London streets--and I have ventured into, three or four--but _I_ do it, bless you, for nine and sevenpence, half-penny, all told! No wonder you want epistolary balm if you're, already in the fifties! Do you give them diamond necklaces and Arab, horses all round?--But Torquay, I too intensely felt, has gorgeous ways, of its own. Really it isn't bad here, for almost every one has left, town. I have yet had nothing worse to suffer than a first night at the, Lyceum--the too great Irvingism of which--mainly in Ellen Terry's, box--had been, the same day, pleasantly mitigated, in advance, by Tessa, Gosse in Sheridan's _Critic_. Tessa had a play and acted Mr Puff better, than any of her blushing fellow-nymphs acted anything else. And on New, Year's eve I go to her parents for a carouse of some sort, and until, then, thank God! I don't dine out save on Xmas day. Nor in 1897--by all, that's holy! _ever_ again! I have been quite smothered with it these two, months--and it's getting far beyond a joke.... I see no literary fry\\n\\nmoreover, your three glorious volumes of illustrated prose have arrived, to enrich my existence, adorn my house and inflame my expectations. With, many things pressing upon me at this moment as preliminary to winding-up, here and betaking myself, till early in the summer, to London, my more, penetrative attention has not yet been free for them; but I am gathering, for the swoop. Please meanwhile be tenderly thanked for the massive and, magnificent character of the gift. What a glorious quantity of work it, brings home to me that you do! I feel like a hurdy-gurdy man listening, outside a cathedral to the volume of sound poured forth there by the, enthroned organist.... But good-night, my dear Howells, with every, feebly-breathed, but forcibly-felt good wish of yours always and ever\\n\\nAnd also I applaud, dearest Howard, your expression of attachment to him, who holds this pen (and passes it at this moment over very dirty paper:), for he is extremely accessible to such demonstrations and touched by, them--more than ever in his lonely (more than) maturity. Keep it up as, hard as possible; continue to pass your hand into my arm and believe, that I always like greatly to feel it. We are two who can communicate, freely.\\n\\ntwinkling and twittering, with a semi-foreign light, a kind of familiar, _wink_ in the air, would have favoured your health, your spirits, and, heaven knows your being here would have favoured mine. I breakfast all, these weeks, mostly, with my window open to the garden and a flood of, sunshine pouring in. It's really meridional. It would--Rye would--remind, you of Granada--more or less. But I hope, after Xmas, to be in town for, three or four months. You will surely pass and repass there. When I, at, intervals, go up, on some practical urgency, for three or four hours, I, always see the abysmal Jon. He usually has some news of you to give; and, when he hasn't it's not for want of--on my part--solemn invocation., However, I must now solemnly invoke slumber. Good-night--good-morning. I, bless your house, its glorious mistress and its innocent heir.\\n\\n, ...I wish you could take a good holiday and spend it in these countries., I have got to feel like such an old European that I could almost pretend, to help to do you the honours. I am at least now a thoroughly, naturalised Londoner--a cockney \\\"convaincu.\\\" I am attached to London in, spite of the long list of reasons why I should not be; I think it on the, whole the best point of view in the world. There are times when the fog\\n\\n, You _shall_ have a letter this morning, whatever happens! I am waiting, for the train to Carcassonne, and you will perhaps ask yourself why you, are thus sandwiched between these two mouldy antiquities. It is, precisely because they are mouldy that I invoke your genial presence., Toulouse is dreary and not interesting, and I am afraid that Carcassonne, will answer to the same description I heard given a couple of weeks ago, by an English lady in Touraine, of the charming Chateau d'Amboise:, \\\"rather curious, you know, but very, very dirty.\\\" Therefore my spirit, turns for comfort to what I have known best in life. I got your last, excellent letter an abominable number of weeks ago; and I hereby, propose, as a rule of our future correspondence, that I be graciously, absolved from ever specifying the time that has elapsed since the, arrival of the letter I am supposed to be answering. This custom will, ease me off immensely. Your last, however, is not so remote but that the, scolding you gave me for sending your previous letter to Mrs. Kemble is, fearfully fresh in my mind. My dear Grace, I regret extremely having, irritated you; but I would fain wrestle with you on this subject. I, think you have a false code about the showing of letters--and in calling, it a breach of confidence you surely confound the limits of things. Of, course there is always a particular discretion for the particular case;, but what are letters but talk, and what is the showing them but the, repetition of talk? The same rules that govern that of course govern the, other; but I don't see why they should be more stringent. It is indeed\\n\\nit all passes over me like an old-time song. You see how much I need you, close at hand to stand successfully on the tiptoe of emulation. You, fatigue, in short, my credulity, though not my affection. We lately, clubbed together, all, to despatch to you an eye-witness in the person, of the genius or the _genus_, in himself, Rudyard, for the concussion of, whose extraordinary personality with your own we are beginning soon to, strain the listening ear. We devoutly hope that this time he will really, be washed upon your shore. With him goes a new little wife--whose, brother--Wolcott Balestier, lately dead, in much youthful promise and, performance (I don't allude, in saying that, especially to the literary, part of it,) was a very valued young friend of mine.... The main thing, that has lately happened to myself is the death of my dear sister a, fortnight ago--after years of suffering, which, however, had not made, her any less rare and remarkable a person or diminished the effect of, the event (when it should occur) in making an extreme difference in my, life. Of my occupation what shall I tell you? I have of late years left, London less and less--but I am thinking sooner or later (in a near, present) of making a long foreign, though not distant, absence. I am, busy with the _short_--I have forsworn the long. I hammer at the horrid, little theatrical problem, with delays and intermissions, but, horrible, to relate, no failure of purpose. I shall soon publish another small, story-book which I will incontinently send you. I have done many brief, fictions within the last year.... The good little Thomas Hardy has, scored a great success with _Tess of the d'Urbervilles_, which is, chock-full of faults and falsity and yet has a singular beauty and, charm....\\n\\nHe spent the summer of 1892 again in Italy, avoiding the tourist-stream, by settling at Siena, after it had subsided, in the company of M. and, Mme. Paul Bourget, by this time his intimate friends. William James and, his family were now in Europe for a year of Switzerland and Italy, and, Henry joined them at Lausanne on his way home. The next two years of, London were given up, almost without intermission, to the hopes and, anxieties of his theatrical affairs, in which he was now completely, immersed--so much so, indeed, as to test his very remarkable powers of, physical endurance, which seem in middle life to have thrown off the, early troubles of his health. When this time of fevered agitation was, over he was able to compose himself at once to happier work, without, apparently feeling even the need of a day's holiday. In 1893 he was in, Paris in the spring, and again for a short while in Switzerland with his, brother; but these excursions were never real holidays--he was quickly, uneasy if he had not work of some kind on hand. He projected another, summer in Italy for the following year, and spent it chiefly in Venice, and Rome. This was the last of Italy, however, for some time; there were, too many friends everywhere--\\\"the most disastrous attempt I have ever, made,\\\" he writes, \\\"to come abroad for privacy and quiet.\\\" Still the only, alternative seemed to be sea-side lodgings in England; and for the, summer of 1895, escaping from the London season as usual, he went to, Torquay. By this time Guy Domville had failed and he was free again; he, had the happiest winter of work in London that he had known for five, years. After finishing some short stories he began The Spoils of, Poynton, and with it the series of his works that belong definitely to, his \\\"later manner.\\\" At last, in 1896, instead of his usual esplanade\\n\\nhe was faithful throughout to a few yards of town-pavement, not because, he was scared by the rough freedom of the wild, but rather because he, was impatient of its insipidity. He is very often to be heard crying out, against the tyrannous claims of his world, when they interfere with his, work, his leisure, his health; but at the moment of greatest revulsion, he never suggests that the claims may be fraudulent after all, or that, this small corner of modernity is not the best and most fruitful that, the age has to shew.\\n\\nwas never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they, fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense, eloquence in her passionate \\\"radicalism\\\"--her most distinguishing, feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like, everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or, example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a, feminine \\\"political force.\\\" But had she lived in the world and seen, things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However\\n\\nand I lick my chops in advance. It is very delectable, I can see, and it, has the prettiest coat and face of any of your volumes.--London is, settling to its winter pace, and the cool rich fogs curtain us in. I see, Colvin once in a while _dans le monde_, which however I frequent less, and less. I miss you too sensibly. My love to your wife and mother--my, greeting to the brave Lloyd.\\n\\nCambridge and Boston society still rejoices in that imposing fixedness, of outline which is ever so inspiring to contemplate. In Cambridge I see, Arthur Sedgwick and Howells; but little of any one else. Arthur seems, not perhaps an enthusiastic, but a well-occupied man, and talks much in, a wholesome way of meaning to go abroad. Howells edits, and observes and, produces--the latter in his own particular line with more and more, perfection. His recent sketches in the _Atlantic_, collected into a, volume, belong, I think, by the wondrous cunning of their manner, to, very good literature. He seems to have resolved himself, however, [into], one who can write solely of what his fleshly eyes have seen; and for, this reason I wish he were \\\"located\\\" where they would rest upon richer, and fairer things than this immediate landscape. Looking about for, myself, I conclude that the face of nature and civilization in this our, country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it, will yield its secrets only to a really _grasping_ imagination. This I, think Howells lacks. (Of course _I_ don't!) To write well and worthily, of American things one need even more than elsewhere to be a _master_., But unfortunately one is less!... I myself have been scribbling some, little tales which in the course of time you will have a chance to read., To write a series of good little tales I deem ample work for a, life-time. I dream that my life-time shall have done it. It's at least a, relief to have arranged one's life-time....\\n\\never and always, to hear from you. You say that had you not been writing, me the particular thing you were, you fear you wouldn't have been, writing at all; but it is a compliment I can better. I really believe, that if I weren't writing you this, on my side, I _should_ be writing, you something else. For I've been, of late, reading you again as, continuously as possible--the worst I mean by which is as continuously, as the book-sellers consent: and the result of \\\"Ragged Lady,\\\" the, \\\"Silver Journey,\\\" the \\\"Pursuit of the Piano\\\" and two or three other, things (none wrested from your inexorable hand, but paid for from scant, earnings) has been, ever so many times over, an impulse of reaction, of, an intensely cordial sort, directly _at_ you--all, alas, spending, itself, for sad and sore want of you, in the heavy air of this alien, clime and the solitude, here, of my unlettered life. I wrote to you to, Kittery Point--I think it was--something like a year ago, and my chief, occupation since then has been listening for the postman's knock. But, let me quickly add that I understand overwhelmingly well what you say of, the impossibility for you, at this time of day, of letters. God knows, they _are_ impossible--the great fatal, incurable, unpumpable leak of, one's poor sinking bark. Non ragioniam di lor--I understand all about, it; and it only adds to the pleasure with which, even on its personal, side, I greet your present communication.\\n\\n, My failure, during these few days, to thank you for everything has not, come from a want of appreciation of _anything_--or from a want of, gratitude, or lively remembrance, or fond hope; or, in short, from, anything but a quite calculating and canny view that I shall perhaps, come in, during your present episode, with a slightly greater effect of, direct support and encouragement than if I had come during the fever of, your late short interval in London. It seems to be \\\"borne in\\\" to me that, you may be feeling--la ou vous etes--a little lone and lorn, a little, alien and exotic; so that the voice of the compatriot, counsellor and, moderator, may fall upon your ears with an approach to sweetness. I am, sure, all the same, that you are in a situation of great and refreshing, novelty and of general picturesque interest. At your leisure you will, give me news of it, and I wish you meanwhile, as the best advice, to, drain it to the dregs and leave no element of it untasted.\\n\\nI ordered my year-old \\\"Maisie\\\" the other day to be sent to you, and I, trust she will by this time have safely arrived--in spite of some, ambiguity in the literation of the name of your villa as, with your, letter in my hand, I earnestly meditate upon it. I have also despatched, to Madame Paul myself a little volume just published--a poor little, pot-boiling study of nothing at all, qui ne tire pas a consequence. It, is but a monument to my fatal technical passion, which prevents my ever, giving up anything I have begun. So that when something that I have, supposed to be a subject turns out on trial really to be none, je m'y, acharne d'autant plus, for mere superstition--superstitious fear, I, mean, of the consequences and omens of weakness. The small book in, question is really but an exercise in the art of not appearing to one's, self to fail. You will say it is rather cruel that for such exercises, the public also should have to pay. Well, Madame Paul and you get your, exemplaire for nothing.\\n\\nwonderful aesthetic hair. From San Remo I came along the rest of the, coast to Genoa, _not_ by carriage however, as I might have done, for I, was rather afraid of three days \\\"on end\\\" of my own society: that is, not, on end, but sitting down. When I am tired of myself in common situations, I can get up and walk away; so, in a word, I came in the train, and the, train came in a tunnel--for it was almost all one--for five or six, hours. I have been going to Venice--but it is so cold and blustering, that I think to-morrow, when I depart from this place, the idea of, reaching the southernmost point will get the better of me, and I shall, make straight for Rome. I will write you from there--where I first, beheld you: that is, familiarity (if I may be allowed the expression)., Enough meanwhile about myself, my intentions and delays: let me hear, or, at least let me ask, about your own circumstances and propensities...., You must have felt _spattered_, like all the world, with the blood of, the poor Russian Czar! Aren't you glad you are not an Empress? But you, are. God save your Majesty!--Mrs. Greville sent me Swinburne's, complicated dirge upon her poor simple mother, and I thought it wanting, in all the qualities that one liked in Mrs T. I should like very much to, send a tender message to Mrs Gordon: indefinite--but _very_ tender! To, you I am both tender and definite (save when I cross).\\n\\nand feeling very easy and even jolly about her Leamington winter. My, being away is a sign of her really good symptoms. She was _wuethend_, after the London police, in connection with the Whitechapel murders, to, a degree that almost constituted robust health. I have seen a great many, (that is, more than usual) Frenchmen in London this year: they bring me, notes of introduction--and the other day, the night before coming away\\n\\nBy the time this reaches you I suppose your wife and children will have, gone to recline under the greenwood tree. I hope their gentle outlawry, will be full of comfort for them. It's poor work to me writing about, them without ever seeing them. But my interest in them is deep and, large, and please never omit to give my great love to them: to Alice, first in the lump, to be broken up and distributed by her. May you, squeeze with a whole skin through the tight weeks of the last of the, term--may you live to rest and may you rest to live. I shall not, I, think, soon again write to you so rarely as for the last year. This will, be partly because _The Tragic Muse_ is to be my last long novel. For the, rest of my life I hope to do lots of short things with irresponsible, spaces between. I see even a great future (ten years) of such. But they, won't make money. Excuse (you probably rather will esteem) the sordid, tone of your affectionate\\n\\n, I have delayed too long to thank you for your genial last: which please, attribute to the misery of my Boulevard-baffled aspirations. Paris n'est, plus possible--from any point of view--and I leave it tomorrow or next, day, when my address will become: _Hotel National, Lucerne_. I join my, brother there for a short time. This place continues to _rengorger_ with, sunshine and sauces, not to mention other appeals to the senses and, pitfalls to the pocket. I am not alluding in particular to the Queen of, Golconda! I have read _Matelot_ more or less over again; for the extreme, penury of the _idea_ in Loti, and the almost puerile thinness of this, particular donnee, wean me not a jot from the irresistible charm the, rascal's very limitations have for me. I drink him down as he _is_--like, a philtre or a _baiser_, and the coloration of his _moindre mots_ has a, peculiar magic for me. Read _aloud_ to yourself the passage ending, section XXXV--the upper part of page 165, and perhaps you will find in, it something of the same strange _eloquence_ of suggestion and rhythm as, I do: which is what literature gives when it is most exquisite and which, constitutes its sovereign value and its resistance to devouring time., And yet what _niaiseries_! Paris continues gorgeous and rainless, but, less torrid. I have become inured to fear as careless of penalties., There are no new books but old papiers de famille et d'arriere-boutique, dished up. Poor Harland came and spent 2 or 3 hours with me the other, afternoon--at a cafe-front and on chairs in the Champs-Elysees. He, looked better than the time previous, but not well; and I am afraid, things are not too well _with_ him. One would like to help him--and I, try to--in talk; but he is not too helpable, for there is a chasm too, deep to bridge, I fear, in the pitfall of his literary longings, unaccompanied by the _faculty_. Apropos of such things I am very glad to, see _your_ faculty is reflowering. I shall return to England for the, volume. Are you writing about Symonds? Vale--especially in the manual, part. And valeat your _dame compagne_.\\n\\nhowever, terribly little doubt that, practically, for those who have, been happy in Europe even Cambridge the Brilliant is not an easy place, to live in. When I saw you in London, plunged up to your necks in that, full, rich, abundant, various London life, I knew that a day of, reckoning was coming and I heaved a secret prophetic sigh. I can well, understand Charles's saying that the memory of these and kindred things, is a perpetual private [? pang]. But pity our poor bare country and, don't revile. England and Italy, with their countless helps to life and, pleasure, are the lands for happiness and self-oblivion. It would seem, that in our great unendowed, unfurnished, unentertained and, unentertaining continent, where we all sit sniffing, as it were, the, very earth of our foundations, we ought to have leisure to turn out, something handsome from the very heart of simple human nature. But after, I have been at home a couple of months I will tell you what I think., Meanwhile I aspire to linger on here in Italy and make the most of, it--even in poor little overshadowed Florence and in a society limited, to waiters and washerwomen. In your letter of last summer you amiably, reproach me with not giving you personal tidings, and warn me in my, letters against mistaking you for the _Nation_. Heaven forbid! But I, have no _nouvelles intimes_ and in this solitary way of life I don't, ever feel especially like a person. I write more or less in the, mornings, walk about in the afternoons, and doze over a book in the, evenings. You can do as well as that in Cambridge....\\n\\n, I have been very sorry to hear from you of renewed upsets on quitting, these walls--the same fate having, I remember, overtaken you most of the, other times you've been here. I trust it isn't the infection of the, walls themselves, nor of the _re_fection (so scant last time) enjoyed, within them. Is it some baleful effluence of your host? He will try and, exercise next time some potent counter-charm--and meanwhile he rejoices, that your devil is cast out.\\n\\nfor the autumn. It was here that he began his intimacy with J. R., Lowell, in afternoon walks with him between mornings of work and, evenings at the Theatre Francais. He declares that he saw no one else in, Paris--his mind was firmly set upon Italy. To Rome he went for the first, six months of 1873, where he was now at home enough among ancient, solitudes to have time and thought for social novelty. Thirty years, later, in his life of William Wetmore Story, he revived the American, world of what was still a barely modernised Rome, the world into which, he was plunged by acquaintance with the sculptor and his circle. Now and, thenceforward it was not so much the matter for sketches of travel that, he was collecting as it was the matter for the greater part of his, best-known fiction. The American in Europe was to be his own subject\\n\\n, J'aurais du deja vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait, en m'envoyant _Sapho_. Je vous suis tres-reconnaissant de cette bonne et, amicale pensee, qui s'ajoutera desormais, pour moi, au souvenir du, livre. Je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivee de votre volume pour le, lire--mais cela m'a donne l'occasion de m'y remettre encore et de tirer, un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages, m'ont laissees. Je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions, dans leur plenitude--dans la crainte de ne reussir qu'a deformer ma, pensee--tout autant que la votre. Un nouveau livre de vous me fait, passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idees, que je vous confierais de, vive voix--et de grand coeur--si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus, souvent. Pour le moment, je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient, de vous compte, pour moi, comme un grand evenement, une jouissance rare, et fructueuse. Je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans, d'autres, mais vous me charmez, vous m'enlevez toujours, et votre, maniere me penetre plus qu'aucune autre. Je trouve dans _Sapho_, enormement de verite et de vie. Ce n'est pas du roman, c'est de, l'histoire, et de la plus complete et de la mieux eclairee. Lorsqu'on a, fait un livre aussi solide et aussi serieux que celui-la, on n'a besoin, d'etre rassure par personne; ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager, moi-meme que je constate dans Sapho encore une preuve--a ajouter a, celles que vous avez donnees--de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir, comme revelation de la vie et du drole de melange que nous sommes. La, fille est etudiee avec une patience merveilleuse--c'est un de ces, portraits qui epuisent un type. Je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune, homme un peu sacrifie--comme etude et comme recherche--sa figure me, paraissant moins eclairee--en comparaison de celle de la femme--qu'il ne, le faudrait pour l'nteret moral la valeur tragique. J'aurais voulu que, vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par ou il a passe--en matiere, d'experience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries, avec Fanny--en matiere de rammollissement de volonte et de relachement, d'ame. En un mot, le drame ne se passe peut-etre pas assez dans l'ame et, dans la conscience de Jean. C'est a mesure que nous touchons a son, caractere meme que la situation devient interessante--et ce caractere\\n\\nin the shape of stuffy midsummer heat (that of this metropolis has a, truly British ponderosity--it's as dull as an article in a Quarterly,), smoke, circulars, invitations, _bills_, the one sauce that Talleyrand, commemorated, and reverberations of the grotesque Jubilee. On the other, hand my small house seems most pleasant and peculiar (in the sense of, being my own,) and my servants are as punctual as they are prim--which, is saying much. But I enjoyed my absence, and I shall endeavour to, repeat it every year, for the future, on a smaller scale; that is, to, leave London, not at the beginning of the winter but at the end, by the, mid-April, and take the period of the insufferable Season regularly in, Italy. It was a great satisfaction to me to find that I am as fond of, that dear country as I ever was--and that its infinite charm and, interest are one of the things in life to be most relied upon. I was, afraid that the dryness of age--which drains us of so many, sentiments--had reduced my old _tendresse_ to a mere memory. But no--it, is really so much in my pocket, as it were, to feel that Italy is always, there. It is rather rude, my dear Grace, to say all this to you--for, whom it is there to so little purpose. But if I should observe this, scruple about all the places that you don't go to, or are not in, when I, write to you, my writing would go very much on one leg. I was back again, in Venice--where I paid a second visit late in the season (from the, middle of May to July 1st)--when I got your last letter. I was staying, at the Palazzo Barbaro, with the Daniel Curtises--the happy owners\\n\\n, I have a very bad conscience and a very heavy heart about my failure to, communicate with you again before you left Rome--for I heard, (afterwards--_much_ afterwards) that you had had final trouble and, inconvenience--that Miss Gertrude, brave being, tempted providence--by, her very bravery--to renew its assaults--and that illness and, complications encumbered your last steps. On the subject of all this I, ought long since to have condoled with you, in default of having, condoled at the time--yet lo, I have shamefully waited for the ignoble, facility of my own table and inkstand, to which, after too prolonged a, separation, I have but just been restored. I got home--from Turin--but, three days ago--and very, very cool and green and wholesome (though only, comparatively, I admit) does this little insular nook appear. After I, last saw you I too was caught up, if not cast down, by the, Fates--whirled, by irresistible Marion Crawfords--off to Sorrento\\n\\nembarrassments, the \\\"decline,\\\" in a word, of old England, go to my, heart, and I can imagine no spectacle more touching, more thrilling and, even dramatic, than to see this great precarious, artificial empire, on, behalf of which, nevertheless, so much of the strongest and finest stuff, of the greatest race (for such they are) has been expended, struggling, with forces which perhaps, in the long run, will prove too many for it., If she only will struggle, and not collapse and surrender and give up a, part which, looking at Europe as it is to-day, still may be great, the, drama will be well worth watching from [such] a good, near standpoint as, I have here. But I didn't mean to be so beastly political! Another drama, interesting me is the question of poor dear J. R. Lowell's possible, recall after Cleveland mounts the throne. This, to me, is tragic\\n\\nof such things, repeated to me the few meagre elements of a small and, gruesome spectral story that had been told _him_ years before and that, he could only give the dimmest account of--partly because he had, forgotten details and partly--and much more--because there had _been_ no, details and no coherency in the tale as he received it, from a person, who also but half knew it. The vaguest essence only was there--some dead, servants and some children. This essence _struck_ me and I made a note, of it (of a most scrappy kind) on going home. There the note remained, till this autumn, when, struck with it afresh, I wrought it into a, fantastic fiction which, first intended to be of the briefest, finally, became a thing of some length and is now being \\\"serialised\\\" in an, American periodical. It will appear late in the spring (chez Heinemann), in a volume with _one_ other story, and then I will send it to you. In, the meanwhile please think of the _doing_ of the thing on my part as, having sprung from that kind old evening at Addington--quite gruesomely, as my unbridled imagination caused me to see the inevitable development, of the subject. It was all worth mentioning to you. I am very busy and, very decently fit and very much yours, always, my dear Arthur\\n\\nthanked to satiety as I am on all sides, don't set your ponderous, machinery in motion to drop the last straw!\\\" So I've put out the fires, and stopped the wheels and paid off the stokers till now. I've held my, tongue like an angel, but I've thought of you--and of your matchless, mate--like--well, if not _a_, at least, _the_ devil, and at last the, whole shop insists on beginning again to hum. I cherish your so, periodical and so munificent thoughts of me as one of the good things of, this world of worries. Nothing ever touches me more. I am finally going, abroad for three months--on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the little, sensitive blank record, in its little green sheath, accompanies me--to, drink in Impressions--in the usual itinerant shrine of your gifts: my, left-hand upper waistcoat-pocket. There are vulgar things--a watch, an, eyeglass, seven-and-sixpence--in the other pockets; but nothing but, _you_ in that one. Voila. I go to Italy after more than 5 years, interlude.\\n\\nwhere the death of Turgenev had made a gap that he greatly felt. For the, rest of the year he was occupied in writing The Bostonians, and went no, further from London than to carry his manuscript into lodgings at Dover, for August and September. A little later his sister Alice arrived from, America, to make the experiment of life in Europe for the benefit of her, now confirmed ill-health. Her presence near at hand, for the few years, that remained to her, was a source of much pleasure, and also of, constant anxiety, to her brother. She was a woman of rare talent and of, strongly marked character; but the life of an invalid, which proved to, be all she was capable of, prevented her from using her opportunities, and from taking the place that would have been open to her. She lived in, great retirement, at first in London, afterwards chiefly at Bournemouth, and Leamington. Henry James was unwearied in his care for her; he, visited her constantly, and never without keen delight in her company, and her vigorous talk. His brotherly attention had yet a further reward, in the summer of 1885, when she was at Bournemouth. To be near her he, spent several weeks there, and was able at the same time to cultivate, the society of another imprisoned invalid, close by, with whom he had, already had some acquaintance. This was Robert Louis Stevenson, and the, intimacy that thus arose very fortunately still survives in many, admirable letters of each to the other. Stevenson's side of the, correspondence, edited by Sir Sidney Colvin, is well known, and Henry, James's can now be added to it; there could be no more illuminating, interchange between two fine artists, so unlike in everything but their, common passion.\\n\\nreally, of recumbency, later, I've been saddled with it for life, and, that even now, my dear Howard, I verily write you _with_ it. I even, wrote _The Awkward Age_ with it: therefore look sharp! I wanted, especially to send you that volume--as an \\\"acknowledgment\\\" of princely, hospitalities received, and formed the intention of so doing even in the, too scant moments we stood face to face among the Rembrandts. That's, right--_be_ one of the few! I greatly applaud the tact with which you, tell me that scarce a human being will understand a word, or an, intention, or an artistic element or glimmer of any sort, of my book. I, tell _myself_--and the \\\"reviews\\\" tell me--such truths in much cruder, fashion. But it's an old, old story--and if I \\\"minded\\\" now as much as I, once did, I should be well beneath the sod. Face to face I should be, able to say a bit how I saw--and why I _so_ saw--my subject. But that, will keep.\\n\\nin an uninterrupted crescendo, all through October and November. All the, good that I hoped of the place has, in fine, profusely bloomed and, flourished here. It was really at about the end of September, when the, various summer supernumeraries had quite faded away, that the special, note of Rye, the feeling of the little hilltop community, bound together, like a very modest, obscure and impecunious, but virtuous and amiable, family, began most unmistakably to come out. This is the present note of, life here, and it has floated me (excuse mixture of metaphor) very, placidly along. Nothing would induce me now _not_ to be here for, Christmas and nothing will induce me not to do my best at least to be, here for the protrusion of the bulbs--the hyacinths and tulips and, crocuses--that, in return for expended shillings, George Gammon promises, me for the earliest peep of spring. As he has broken no word with me, yet, I trust him implicitly for this. Meantime too I have trusted him\\n\\nGuicciardinis, Rucellais, etc., mounted on magnificent horses and, wearing admirable dresses with the childlike gallantry and glee with, which only Italians can wear them, riding through the brown old streets, and followed by an immense train of citizens all in the carefullest, quattro-cento garb. This was really a noble picture and testified to the, latent love of splendour which is still in those dear people and which, only asks for a favouring chance to shine out, even at the cost of, ruining them. Before leaving Italy I spent a week with Mrs. Kemble at, Lago Maggiore--she having dipped over there, in spite of torrid heat., She is a very (or at least a partly) extinct volcano to-day, and very, easy and delightful to dwell with, in her aged resignation and, _adoucissements_. But she did suggest to me, on seeing her again after, so long an interval, that it is rather a melancholy mistake, in this, uncertain life of ours, to have founded oneself on so many rigidities, and rules--so many siftings and sortings. Mrs. Kemble is _toute d'une, piece_, more than any one, probably, that ever lived; she moves in a, mass, and if she does so little as to button her glove it is the whole, of her \\\"personality\\\" that does it. Let us be flexible, dear Grace; let, us be flexible! and even if we don't reach the sun we shall at least, have been up in a balloon.--I left Stresa on the 15th of this month, had, a glorious day on the Simplon amid mountain streams and mountain, flowers, and came quickly home.... I shall be here for the rest of the, summer--save for little blotches of absence--and I look forward to some, quiet months of work. I am trying, not without success, to get out of, society--as hard as some people try to get in. I want to be dropped and, cut and consummately ignored. This only demands a little patience, and I, hope eventually to elbow my way down to the bottom of the wave--to, achieve an obscurity. This would sound fatuous if I didn't add that, success is easily within my grasp. I know it all--all that one sees by, \\\"going out\\\"--to-day, as if I had made it. But if I had, I would have, made it better! I think of you on your porch--amid all your creepers and, tendrils; and wherever you are, dear Grace, I am your very faithful and, much remembering friend\\n\\n, It is an immense satisfaction to get your news--and no figure of speech, to say that it has found me literally on the point of reaching out, for, it, into the thick twilight of your whereabouts. I have had my general, silence much on my conscience--and especially my dumbness and darkness, to Rosina and Bay, for whom my movements must have been enveloped in a, perfidious mystery that has caused me, I fear, to forfeit all their, esteem. But let me tell you first of all how I rejoice in your good, conditions and in your having found your feet. It was \\\"borne in\\\" upon, me, on general grounds, that Southwold would never do for long, and it, is charming that you have found so near and so nice a substitute. I, especially delight (without wanting to sacrifice the rest of you) in, such a letting-down-easy of the Art-Daughters. Please give them my, tender love and tell them that, preposterous as it sounds, I have never\\n\\nI would have you know: it would have flown straight up the chimney and, taken, unscathed as marble, its invulnerable way to the individual for, whom it had just been so admirably winged. You say to me exactly the, right things, and you say them to exactly the right person. I can't tell, you how glad I am for you that you have all that highest sanity and, soundness (though it isn't as if I doubted it!) of emotion, full, frank, and deep. If there be a wisdom in not feeling--to the last throb--the, great things that happen to us, it is a wisdom I shall never either know, or esteem. Let your soul live--it's the only life that isn't, on the, whole, a sell. You have evidently been magnificent, and as I have my, hand on your shoulder I take the opportunity of patting you very, tenderly on the back. That back will evidently carry its load and be all, the straighter for the--as it seems to me--really quite massive, experience. I rejoice that the waters have held you up--they do, always\\n\\nAm asking very great favour of your coming down for inside of day or for, night if possible house took fire last night but only Green Room and, Dining Room affected hot hearth in former igniting old beam beneath with, tiresome consequences but excellent local brigade's help am now helpless, in face of reconstructions of injured portions and will bless you, mightily if you come departure of course put off Henry James.\\n\\n, I should be a poor creature if I had read your two last volumes without, feeling the liveliest desire to write to you. That is the desire you, must have kindled indeed in more quarters than you will care to reckon, with; but even this reflection doesn't stay my pen, save to make me, parenthise that I should be absolutely distressed to receive from you, any acknowledgment of these few lines.\\n\\nIf anything can give to those who did not know him an impression of, Henry James's talk, it will be some of the finest of these later, letters. One difference indeed is immediately to be marked. His, pondering hesitation as he talked, his search over the whole field of, expression for the word that should do justice to the picture forming in, his mind--this gives place in the letters to a flow unchecked, one, sonorous phrase uncoiling itself after another without effort. Pen in, hand, or, as he finally preferred, dictating to his secretary, it was, apparently easier for him to seize upon the images he sought to detach\\n\\nThe relic in question consists of certain pencilled pages, found among, his papers, in which he speaks with only himself for listener. They, belong to the same order as the notes for the unfinished novels, but, they are even more informal and confidential. Nothing else of the kind, seems to have survived; the schemes and motives that must have swarmed, in his brain, far too numerously for notation, have all vanished but, this one. At Rye, some years before the end, he began one night to feel, his way towards a novel which he had in mind--a subject afterwards, abandoned in the form projected at first. The rough notes in which he, casts about to clear the ground are mostly filled with the mere details, of his plan--the division of the action, the characters required, a, tentative scenario. These I pass over in order to quote some passages, where he suddenly breaks away, leaves his imaginary scene, and, surrenders to the awe and wonder of finding himself again, where he has, so often stood before, on the threshold and brink of creation. It is as, though for once, at an hour of midnight silence and solitude, he opened, the innermost chamber of his mind and stood face to face with his, genius. There is no moment of all his days in which it is now possible, to approach him more closely. Such a moment represented to himself the, pith of life--the first tremor of inspiration, in which he might be, almost afraid to stir or breathe, for fear of breaking the spell, if it, were not that he goes to meet it with a peculiar confidence.\\n\\n, Ever since receiving and reading your elegant volume of short tales--the, arrival of which from you was affecting and delightful to me--I've meant, to write to you, but the wish has struggled in vain with the daily, distractions of a tolerably busy summer. I should blush, however, if the, season were to melt away without my greeting and thanking you. I read, your book with joy and found in it recalls from far far away--stray, echoes and scents as from another, the American, the prehistoric, existence. The thing that most took me was that entitled A Difficult, Case, which I found beautiful and admirable, ever so true and ever so, _done_. But I fear I more, almost, than anything else, lost myself in, mere envy of your freedom to do, and, speaking vulgarly, to place\\n\\n, Your generous letter has, this wild, mild, soft, sombre morning, made me, feel as if I were standing beside you, with my hand on your shoulder, in, an embrasure of one of the windows--at that fine old Farnham Castle that, I have seen (years ago)--that look out on the noble things you speak, of. And the communication in question is worthy, exactly, of the, _things_ in question; and grave and handsome and interesting and, touching even as they are. \\\"Burn\\\" it, quotha!--it _wouldn't_ have burnt\\n\\n, I have never yet thanked you for the amiable note in which you kindly, invited me to write to you from the Americas; and the best way I can do, so now is to simply respond to your invitation. I am in the Americas, indeed, and behold I write. These countries are extremely pleasant, and, I recommend you to come and see them au plus tot. You would have a great, career here, and would return--if you should return at all--with a, multitude of scalps at your slim girdle. There is a great demand for, brilliant women, and I can promise you that you would be intimately, appreciated. I shall return about the first of May--but without any, blond scalps, though with a great many happy impressions. Though I, should perhaps not linger upon the point myself, I believe I have had a, certain success. As for ces gens-ci, they have had great success with, me, and have been delightfully genial and hospitable. It is here that, people treat you well; venez-y voir. You have had a great many things, I, know; but you have not had a winter in the Americas. The people are, extremely nice and humane. I didn't care for it much at first--but it, improves immensely on acquaintance, and after you have got the right, point of view and _diapason_ it is a wonderfully entertaining and, amusing country. The skies are as blue as the blotting paper (as yet, unspotted) on which this scrawl reposes, and the sunshine, which is, deliciously warm, has always an air de fete. I have seen multitudes of, people, and no one has been disagreeable. That is different from your, pretentious Old World. Of Washington I can speak as yet but little\\n\\nsuperior enough, to say _anything_, for conversation, later. It's in the, light of unlimited conversation that I see the future years, and my, honoured chair by the ingleside will require a succession of new, cushions. I miss you shockingly--for, my dear fellow, there is no, one--literally no one; and I don't in the least follow you--I can't go, with you (I mean in conceptive faculty and the \\\"realising sense,\\\") and, you are for the time absolutely as if you were dead to me--I mean to my, imagination of course--not to my affection or my prayers. And so I shall, keep humble that you may pump into me--and make me stare and sigh and, look simple and be quite out of it--for ever and ever. It's the best, thing that can happen to one to see it written in your very hand that, you have been so uplifted in health and cheer, and if another year will, screw you up so tight that you won't \\\"come undone\\\" again, I will try and, hold on through the barren months. I will go to Mrs. Sitwell, to hear, what has made you blush--it must be something very radical. Your, chieftains are dim to me--why shouldn't they be when you yourself are?, _Va_ for another year--but don't stay away longer, for we should really\\n\\n, ...I was much depressed on reading your letter by your painful, reflections on _The Europeans_; but now, an hour having elapsed, I am, beginning to hold up my head a little; the more so as I think I myself, estimate the book very justly and am aware of its extreme slightness. I, think you take these things too rigidly and unimaginatively--too much as, if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct, to which one's life, were somehow committed; but I think also that you're quite right in, pronouncing the book 'thin' and empty. I don't at all despair, yet, of, doing something fat. Meanwhile I hope you will continue to give me, when, you can, your free impression of my performances. It is a great thing to, have some one write to one of one's things as if one were a third, person, and you are the only individual who will do this. I don't think, however you are always right, by any means. As for instance in your, objection to the closing paragraph of _Daisy Miller_, which seems to me, queer and narrow, and as regards which I don't seize your point of view., J'en appelle to the sentiment of any other story-teller whatsoever; I am, sure none such would wish the paragraph away. You may say--'Ah, but, other _readers_ would.' But that is the same; for the teller is but a, more developed reader. I don't trust your judgment altogether (if you, will permit me to say so) about _details_; but I think you are, altogether right in returning always to the importance of subject. I, hold to this, strongly; and if I don't as yet seem to proceed upon it, more, it is because, being 'very artistic,' I have a constant impulse to, try experiments of form, in which I wish to not run the risk of wasting, or gratuitously using big situations. But to these I am coming now. It, is something to have learned how to write, and when I look round me and, see how few people (doing my sort of work) know how (to my sense,) I, don't regret my step-by-step evolution. I don't advise you however to, read the two last things I have written--one a thing in the Dec. and, Jan. _Cornhill_, which I will send home; and the other a piece I am just, sending to Howells. They are each quite in the same manner as _The, Europeans_.\\n\\n, A laggard in response you and Alice will indeed feel that I have become., I've had for three or four days your so interesting and relieving letter, dictated to Alice at the hour of poor Myers's death, and though it, greatly eased me off (as to my fears that the whole thing would have, worn you out,) yet till this moment my hand has been stayed. I wrote you, very briefly, moreover, as soon as the papers here gave the news., Blessed seems it to have been that everything round about Myers was so, sane and comfortable; the reasonableness and serenity of his wife and, children etc., not to speak of his own high philosophy, which it must, have been fine to see in operation. But I hope the sequel hasn't been, prolonged, and have been supposing that, by the necessary quick, departure of his \\\"party,\\\" you will have been left independent again and, not too exhausted. We here, on our side, have been gathering close, round the poor old dying and dead Queen, and are plunged in universal, mourning tokens--which accounts for my black-edged paper. It has really, been, the event, most moving, interesting and picturesque. I have felt, _more_ moved, much, than I should have expected (such is _community_ of, sentiment,) and one has realized all sorts of things about the brave old, woman's beneficent duration and holding-together virtue. The thing has, been journalistically overdone, of course--greatly; but the people have, appeared to advantage--serious and sincere and decent--_really_ caring., Meanwhile the drama of the accession, new reign, &c., has its lively, spectacular interest--even with the P. of W. for hero. I dined last, night in company with some Privy Councillors who had met him, ceremonially, in the a.m., and they said (John Morley in particular, said) that he made a very good impression. Speriamo!\\n\\nsafe and secret, though there are three or four copies in existence), which makes me feel as if there had been a triumphant premiere and I had, received overtures from every managerial quarter and had only to count, my gold. At any rate I am delighted that you have been struck with it, exactly as I have tried to strike, and that the pure practical character, of the effort has worked its calculated spell upon you. For what, encourages me in the whole business is that, as the piece stands, there, is not, in its felicitous form, the ghost of a \\\"fluke\\\" or a mere chance:, it is all \\\"art\\\" and an absolute address of means to the end--the end\\n\\n, I've been very uncivilly silent, but I've also been still more dismally, hindered--I mean ever since receiving your good note of Feb. 22d. It, found me wearily, drearily ill, in bed; such had been my state ever, since Jan. 29th, and it ceased to be my state only ten days ago--since, when I have sat feebly staring at a mountain of unanswered letters. I, did go to London, Jan. 27th, but was immediately stricken, and scrambled, back here to be more commodiously prostrate. I've had to stay and, recuperate. But I am infinitely better--only universally behind. Still\\n\\nthings of that particular and so agreeable dimension--I mean the, dimension of most of the stories in the volume. It is sternly enjoined, upon one here (where an agent-man does what he can for me) that, everything--every hundred--above 6 or 7 thousand words is fatal to, \\\"placing\\\"; so that I do them of that length, with great care, art and, time (much reboiling,) and then, even then, can scarcely get them worked, off--published even when they've been accepted.... So that (though I, don't know why I inflict on you these sordid groans--except that I, haven't any one else to inflict them on--and the mere affront--of being, unused so inordinately long--is almost intolerable) I don't feel incited, in that direction. Fortunately, however, I am otherwise immersed. I, lately finished a tolerably long novel, and I've written a third of, another--with still another begun and two or three more subjects, awaiting me thereafter like carriages drawn up at the door and horses, champing their bits. And apropos of the first named of these, which is, in the hands of the Harpers, I have it on my conscience to let you know, that the idea of the fiction in question had its earliest origin in a, circumstance mentioned to me--years ago--in respect to no less a person, than yourself. At Torquay, once, our young friend Jon. Sturges came down, to spend some days near me, and, lately from Paris, repeated to me five, words you had said to him one day on his meeting you during a call at, Whistler's. I thought the words charming--you have probably quite, forgotten them; and the whole incident suggestive--so far as it was an, incident; and, more than this, they presently caused me to see in them, the faint vague germ, the mere point of the _start_, of a subject. I, noted them, to that end, as I note everything; and years afterwards, (that is three or four) the subject sprang at me, one day, out of my, notebook. I don't know if it be good; at any rate it has been treated\\n\\nor those of disappointment and depression that have followed it; from, which last, however, I am rapidly and resolutely, thank God, emerging., The \\\"papers\\\" have, into the bargain, been mainly ill-natured and densely, stupid and vulgar; but the only two dramatic critics who count, W., Archer and Clement Scott, have done me more justice. Meanwhile all, _private_ opinion is apparently one of extreme admiration--I have been, flooded with letters of the warmest protest and assurance.... Everyone, who was there has either written to me or come to see me--I mean every, one I know and many people I don't. Obviously the little play, which I, strove to make as broad, as simple, as clear, as British, in a word, as, possible, is over the heads of the _usual_ vulgar theatre-going London, public--and the chance of its going for a while (which it is too early, to measure) will depend wholly on its holding on long enough to attract, the _unusual_. I was there the second night (Monday, 7th) when, before a, full house--a remarkably good \\\"money\\\" house Alexander told me--it went, singularly well. But it's soon to see or to say, and I'm prepared for, the worst. The thing fills me with horror for the abysmal vulgarity and, brutality of the theatre and its regular public, which God knows I have, had intensely even when working (from motives as \\\"pure\\\" as pecuniary, motives _can_ be) against it; and I feel as if the simple freedom of, mind thus begotten to return to one's legitimate form would be simply by, itself a divine solace for everything. Don't worry about me: I'm a Rock., If the play has no life on the stage I shall publish it; it's altogether, the best thing I've done. You would understand better the elements of, the case if you had seen the thing it followed (_The Masqueraders_) and, the thing that is now succeeding at the Haymarket--the thing of Oscar, Wilde's. On the basis of _their_ being plays, or successes, my thing is, necessarily neither. Doubtless, moreover, the want of a roaring, actuality, simplified to a few big _familiar_ effects, in my subject--an, episode in the history of an old English Catholic family in the last, century--militates against it, with all usual theatrical people, who, don't want plays (from variety and nimbleness of fancy) of different, _kinds_, like books and stories, but only of one kind, which their, stiff, rudimentary, clumsily-working vision recognizes as the kind, they've had before. And yet I had tried so to meet them! But you can't, make a sow's ear out of a silk purse.--I can't write more--and don't ask, for more details. This week will probably determine the fate of the, piece. If there is increased advance-booking it will go on. If there, isn't, it will be withdrawn, and with it all my little hope of profit., The time one has given to such an affair from the very first to the very, last represents in all--so inconceivably great, to the uninitiated, is, the amount--a pitiful, tragic bankruptcy of hours that might have been, rendered retroactively golden. But I am not plangent--one must take the, thick with the thin--and I have such possibilities of another and better, sort before me. I am only sorry for your and Alice's having to be so, sorry for yours forever\\n\\nthere is something that holds one in one's place, makes it a standpoint, in the universe which it is probably good not to forsake. You are right, in your consciousness that we are all echoes and reverberations of the, _same_, and you are noble when your interest and pity as to everything, that surrounds you, appears to have a sustaining and harmonizing power., Only don't, I beseech you, _generalize_ too much in these sympathies and, tendernesses--remember that every life is a special problem which is not, yours but another's, and content yourself with the terrible algebra of, your own. Don't melt too much into the universe, but be as solid and, dense and fixed as you can. We all live together, and those of us who, love and know, live so most. We help each other--even unconsciously\\n\\nare very close and charming company to me as I sit scribbling--writing, many notes among other things--in still, indoor days that are grateful, to me. You were one of the very few persons in England who had seen my, sister even a little--and I am very glad of that. She was a rare and, remarkable being, and her death makes a great difference in my, existence. But for her it is only blessed. I hope you are happy in the, good reasons you have for being so--if one _is_ happy strictly, (certainly one isn't the reverse) for \\\"reasons.\\\"\\n\\n, Your so liberal and graceful letter is to my head like coals of fire--so, repeatedly for all these weeks have I had feebly to suffer frustrations, in the matter of trundling over the marsh to ask for your news and wish, for your continued amendment. The shortening days and the deepening mud, have been at the bottom of this affair. I never get out of the house, till 3 o'clock, when night is quickly at one's heels. I would have taken, a regular day--I mean started in the a.m.--but have been so ridden\\n\\ngenerally, and the English character have, a certain number of great, plump flourishing uglinesses and drearinesses which offer themselves, irresistibly as pin-cushions to criticism and irony. The British mind is, so totally un-ironical in relation to itself that this is a perpetual, temptation. You will know the things I mean--you will remember them--let, that suffice. Non ragioniam di lor!--I don't suppose you will envy me, for having dined out 107 times--you will simply wonder what can have, induced me to perpetrate such a folly, and how I have survived to tell, the tale! I admit that it is enough for the present, and for the rest of, the summer I shall take in sail. When the warm weather comes I find, London evenings very detestable, and I marvel at the powers of endurance, of my fellow \\\"factors,\\\" as it is now the fashion to call human, beings--(actors--poor blundering unapplauded Comedians would be a better, name). Would you like a little gossip? I am afraid I have nothing very, lively in hand; but I take what comes uppermost. I am to dine tonight at, Sir Frederick Pollock's, to meet one or two of the (more genteel), members of the Comedie Francaise, who are here just now, playing with, immense success and supplying the London world with that invaluable, boon, a topic. I mean the whole Comedie is here _en masse_ for six, weeks. I have been to see them two or three times and I find their, artistic perfection gives one an immense lift out of British air. I took, with me one night Mrs. Kemble, who is a great friend of mine and to my, sense one of the most interesting and delightful of women. I have a sort, of notion you don't like her; but you would if you knew her better. She, is to my mind the first woman in London, and is moreover one of the, consolations of my life. Another night I had with me a person whom it, would divert you to know--a certain Mrs. Greville (a cousin, by, marriage, of the Greville Papers:) the queerest creature living, but a, mixture of the ridiculous and the amiable in which the amiable, preponderates. She is crazy, stage-struck, scatter-brained, what the, French call _extravagante_; but I can't praise her better than by saying, that though she is on the whole the greatest fool I have ever known, I, like her very much and get on with her most easily.... I am just, finishing a short novel which will appear presently in six numbers of, Scribner. This is to say please don't read it in that puerile periodical, (where its appearance is due to--what you will be glad to hear--large, pecuniary inducements,) but wait till it comes out as a book. It is, worth being read in that shape. I have asked you no questions--yet I, have finished my letter. Let my blessing, my tender good wishes and, affectionate assurances of every kind stand instead of them. Divide, these with Charles, with your mother, with the children, and believe me\\n\\nwhen you write me so kindly about the hideous American episode--almost, the worst feature of which is that I don't either like or trust the new, President, a dangerous and ominous Jingo--of whom the most hopeful thing, to say is that he may be rationalized by this sudden real, responsibility. _Speriamo_, as we used to say in the golden age, in the, heavenly mansion, along with the ministering angel, long, long ago. And, all thanks meanwhile for your sympathetic thought. It must indeed--the, base _success_ of the act--cause a sinking of the heart among the, potentates in circulation. One wonders, for instance, just now, who is, most nervous, the poor little Tsar for himself or M. Loubet for him. Let, us thank our stars that we are not travelling stars, I not even a, Loubet, nor you a Loubette, and that though we have many annoyances we, are probably not marked for the dagger of the assassin.\\n\\nI hope you have by this time roared--and not _wholly_ with rage and, despair!--through the tunnel of your dark consciousness of return. I, dare say you are now quite out on the flowery meads of almost doubting, of having been away. This makes me fear your promise to come back--right, soon--next summer--may even now have developed an element of base, alloy. I rushed off to see Mrs. Harland the instant I heard _she_ was, back, and got hold of you--and of Mildred--for five minutes (and of all, the handsomest parts of both of you) in her talk. She had left a dying, mother, however, and her general situation has, I fear, its pressure and, pinch. What an interest indeed your boy's outlook must be to you! But\\n\\nhow such an ordeal--odious in its essence!--is only made tolerable and, palatable by great success; and in how many ways accordingly non-success, may be tormenting and tragic, a bitterness of every hour, ramifying into, every throb of one's consciousness. Tonight the thing will have lived, the whole of its troubled little life of 31 performances, and will be, \\\"taken off,\\\" to be followed, on Feb. 5th, by a piece by Oscar Wilde that, will have probably a very different fate. On the night of the 5th, too, nervous to do anything else, I had the ingenious thought of going to, some other theatre and seeing some other play as a means of being, coerced into quietness from 8 till 10.45. I went accordingly to the, Haymarket, to a new piece by the said O.W. that had just been, produced--\\\"An Ideal Husband.\\\" I sat through it and saw it played with, every appearance (so far as the crowded house was an appearance) of, complete success, and _that_ gave me the most fearful apprehension. The, thing seemed to me so helpless, so crude, so bad, so clumsy, feeble and, vulgar, that as I walked away across St. James's Square to learn my own, fate, the prosperity of what I had seen seemed to me to constitute a, dreadful presumption of the shipwreck of _G.D._, and I stopped in the, middle of the Square, paralyzed by the terror of this, probability--afraid to go on and learn more. \\\"How _can_ my piece do, anything with a public with whom _that_ is a success?\\\" It couldn't--but, even then the full truth was, \\\"mercifully,\\\" not revealed to me; the, truth that in a short month my piece would be whisked away to make room, for the triumphant Oscar. If, as I say, this episode has, by this time\\n\\nthat I mention August 1904 very advisedly. If I want (and it's half the, battle) to go to the West and South, and even, dreamably, to Mexico, I, [could not] do these things during that part of the summer during which, (besides feeling, I fear, very ill from the heat) I should simply have, to sit still. On the other hand I should like immensely not to fail of, coming in for the _whole_ American autumn, and like hugely, in especial\\n\\n, Let my first word be to ask you to pardon this vulgar machinery and this, portentous legibility: the fruit of dictation, in the first place (now, made absolutely necessary to me;) and the fruit, in the second place, of, the fact that, pegging away as I am at present, in your interest and, Waldo's (and with the end of our business now, I am happy to say, well, in sight), I so live, as it were, from day to day and from hour to hour\\n\\nAnd may I say (as I _can_ read nothing, if I read it at all, save in the, light of how one would _one's self_ proceed in tackling the same, _data_!) just two other things? One is that I think your material, suffers a little from the fact that the reader feels you approach your, subject too _immediately_, show him its elements, the cards in your, hand, too bang off from the first page--so that a wait to begin to guess, _what and whom the thing is going to be about_ doesn't impose itself:, the ante-chamber or two and the crooked corridor before he is already in, the Presence. The other is that you don't give him a positive sense of, dealing with your subject from its logical centre. This centre I, gathered to be, from what you told me in Rome (and one gathers it also, from the title,) the consciousness of Eleanor--to which all the rest, (Manisty, Lucy, the whole phantasmagoria and drama) is presented by, life. I should have urged you: \\\"Make that consciousness full, rich\\n\\nclashed against the artificial restraints, as they seemed, of physical, age; whenever these were relaxed, it leaped forward to work again. The, challenge of the war with Germany roused him to a height of passion he, had never touched before in the outer world; and if the strain of it, exhausted his strength, as well it might, it gave him one last year of, the fullest and deepest experience, perhaps, that he had ever known. It, wore out his body, which was too tired and spent to live longer; but he, carried away the power of his spirit still in its prime.\\n\\nfor self-defence, have to outlive [?] you.... I myself do little but sit, at home and write little tales--and even long ones--you shall see them, when you come back. Nothing would induce me, by sending them to you, to, expose myself to damaging Polynesian comparisons. For the rest, there is, nothing in this land but the eternal Irish strife--the place is all, gashed and gory with it. I can't tell you of it--I am too sick of, it--more than to say that two or three of the most interesting days I, ever passed were lately in the crowded, throbbing, thrilling little, court of the Special Commission, over the astounding drama of the forged, _Times_ letters.\\n\\nbut of divine magnanimity and gentleness. You appear to have spoken to, her \\\"as if you still liked me,\\\" and I like you so much for that that the, vibration has started these stammering accents. I really write you these, words not from my peaceful hermitage by the southern sea, but from the, depths of the meretricious metropolis, which I've never known so, detestable as at this most tawdry of crises, and from which I hope to, escape in a day or two, utterly dodging the insane crush of the, Coronation. The place is vilely disfigured by league-long hoardings (for, spectators at L10 0. 0. a head,) and cheap and awful decorations, and, the dear old Abbey in particular smothered into the likeness of the, Earl's Court Exhibition--not to be distinguished from the Westminster, Aquarium, in fact, opposite. And then the crowds, the gregarious, gaping, millions, are appalling, and I fly, in fine, back to the Southern, Sea--on the shore of which I've spent almost all my time for almost a, year past. I've lately been dabbling a little, for compensation, in, town; but I find small doses of London now go further, for my, organisation, than they used.\\n\\nby the aid of this mechanism, that it is an effort to me to break with, it even for my correspondence. I had promised myself to write you so, that you should receive my letter on the very Capo d'Anno; and if I had, _then_ overcome my scruple as to launching at you a dictated thing, you, would some time ere this have been in possession of my news. I have, delayed till now because I was every day hoping to catch the right, moment to address you a page or two of my own proper hieroglyphics. But, one's Christmas-tide burden (of writing) here is heavy; I didn't snatch, the moment; and _this_ is a brave precaution lest it should again elude, me; which, in the interest of lucidity, please again forgive.\\n\\ngenerally, repay. My cell is spacious, southern, looking over Carlton, Gardens: and tranquil, utterly, and singularly well-serviced; and I find, I can work there--there being ample margin for a type-writer and its, priest, or even priestess. It all hung by _that_--but I think I am not, deceived; so I bear up. And the next time you come to perch at a, neighbouring establishment, I shall sweep down on you from my eyrie., It's astonishing how remote, cumbrous and expensive it makes 34 De Vere, Gardens seem. Worse luck that that millstone still dangles gracefully, from my neck!...\\n\\nAll thanks for your so vivid news of the overflow of Henley's gall. Ca, ne pouvait manquer--ca _devait_ venir. I have sent for the article and, will write you when I've read it. I gather from you that it's really, rather a striking and lurid--and so far interesting case--of long, discomfortable jealousy and ranklement turned at last to posthumous (as, it were!) malignity, and making the man do, coram publico, his ugly act\\n\\nand this morning my windows are lashed by a wet hurricane. It makes me, wish I could settle down to a luxurious irresponsible day with the, _Lourdes_ of your appreciation, which lies there on my table still, uncut. But my \\\"holiday\\\" is no holiday and I must drive the mechanic pen., Moreover I have vowed not to open _Lourdes_ till I shall have closed, with a final furious bang the unspeakable _Lord Ormont_, which I have, been reading at the maximum rate of ten pages--ten insufferable and, unprofitable pages, a day. It fills me with a critical rage, an artistic, fury, utterly blighting in me the indispensable principle of _respect_., I have finished, at this rate, but the first volume--whereof I am moved, to declare that I doubt if any equal quantity of extravagant verbiage\\n\\nfrankly, \\\"Mayn't I come down and _see_?--or hear?\\\" were it not that I, return to fearful arrears myself, and restored to this small temple of, application, from which I've so long been absent, feel absolutely, obliged to sit tight for several weeks to come. Later in the summer, if, you'll let me, I _shall_ ask for an invitation. If all this while I've, not sent you _The Awkward Age_ it has been because I thought it not fair, to make any such appeal to your attention while you were preoccupied and, worried. Perhaps--absolutely, in fact--I wanted the book to reach you at, a moment when the coast might be comparatively clear. Possibly it isn't, clear even now. At all events I am writing to Heinemann to-day to, despatch to you the volume. But _please_ don't look at it till all the, elements of leisure--margin--peace of mind--lend themselves. And don't, answer _this_. You have far other business in hand.\\n\\nI have had an autumn of things rather than of people, and have not much, to relate in regard to human nature. Here in Paris, for a few days, I, find I know really too many people--especially as they are for the most, part acquaintances retained for the sake of social decency rather than, of strong sentiment. They consume all my time, so that I can't even go, to the Theatre Francais! In Rome I found the relics and fragments of the, ancient American group, which has been much broken up--or rather broken, down. But neither in its meridian nor in its decline has it had any, very irresistible charms. The chief quality acquired by Americans who, have lived thirty years in Europe seems to me a fierce susceptibility on, the subject of omitted calls.\\n\\nJanuary 13th.--I met Colvin last night, after writing the above--in the, company of Sir James Stephen, Sir Theo. Martin, Sir Douglas Galton, Sir, James Paget, Sir Alfred Lyall, Canon Ainger, and George du Maurier. How, this will make you lick your chops over Ori and Rahiro and Tamatia and, Taheia--or whatever ces messieurs et ces dames, your present visiting, list, are called. He told me of a copious diary-letter he has just got, from you, bless you, and we are discussing a day on which I shall soon, come to meat or drink with him and listen to the same. Since yesterday I, have also read the ballad book--with the admiration that I always feel, as a helplessly verseless creature (it's a sentiment worth nothing as a, testimony) for all performances in rhyme and metre--especially on the, part of producers of fine prose.\\n\\nat any rate, the impression of the book remains, and I have infinitely, pleased myself, even in my shame, with thinking of the pleasure that, must have come to yourself from so acclaimed and attested a, demonstration of the freshness, within you still, of the spirit of, evocation. Delightful, in one's golden afternoon, and after many days, and many parturitions, to put forth thus a young, strong, living flower., You have done nothing more true and complete, more thoroughly, homogeneous and hanging-together, without the faintest ghost of a false, note or a weak touch--all as sharply ciphered-up and tapped-out as the, \\\"proof\\\" of a prize scholar's sum on a slate. It is in short miraculously, felt and beautifully done, and the aged--by which I mean the, richly-matured--sposi _as_ done as if sposi were a new and fresh idea to, you. Of all your sposi they are, I think, the most penetrated and most, penetrating. I took in short true comfort in the whole manifestation\\n\\n_my_ impression longs to complete itself) in the presence of voices in, the darkness--voices the more distinct and vivid, the more brave and, sonorous, as voices always are--but also the more tormenting and, confounding--by reason of these bandaged eyes. I utter a pleading moan, when you, e.g., transport your characters, toward the end, in a line or, two from Leyden to Dunkirk without the glint of a hint of all the, ambient picture of the 18th century road. However, stick to your own, system of evocation so long as what you positively achieve is so big., Life and letters and art all take joy in you.\\n\\ninconceivable. Life is too short a business and friendship too delicate, a matter for such tricks--for cutting great gory masses out of 'em by, the year at a time. Therefore come back. Hang it all--sink it all and, come back. A little more and I shall cease to believe in you: I don't, mean (in the usual implied phrase) in your veracity, but literally and, more fatally in your relevancy--your objective reality. You have become, a beautiful myth--a kind of unnatural uncomfortable unburied _mort_. You, put forth a beautiful monthly voice, with such happy notes in it--but it, comes from too far away, from the other side of the globe, while I, vaguely know that you are crawling like a fly on the nether surface of, my chair. Your adventures, no doubt, are wonderful; but I don't, successfully evoke them, understand them, believe in them. I do in those, you write, heaven knows--but I don't in those you perform, though the, latter, I know, are to lead to new revelations of the former and your, capacity for them is certainly wonderful enough. This is a selfish, personal cry: I wish you back; for literature is lonely and Bournemouth, is barren without you. Your place in my affection has not been usurped, by another--for there is not the least little scrap of another to usurp, it. If there were I would perversely try to care for him. But there, isn't--I repeat, and I literally care for nothing but your return. I, haven't even your novel to stay my stomach withal. The wan wet months, elapse and I see no sign of it. The beautiful portrait of your wife, shimmers at me from my chimney-piece--brought some months ago by the, natural McClure--but seems to refer to one as dim and distant and, delightful as a \\\"toast\\\" of the last century. I wish I could make you, homesick--I wish I could spoil your fun. It is a very featureless time., The summer is rank with rheumatism--a dark, drowned, unprecedented, season. The town is empty but I am not going away. I have no money, but, I have a little work. I have lately written several short fictions--but, you may not see them unless you come home. I have just begun a novel, which is to run through the _Atlantic_ from January 1st and which I, aspire to finish by the end of this year. In reality I suppose I shall, not be fully delivered of it before the middle of next. After that, with, God's help, I propose, for a longish period, to do nothing but short, lengths. I want to leave a multitude of pictures of my time, projecting, my small circular frame upon as many different spots as possible and, going in for number as well as quality, so that the number may, constitute a total having a certain value as observation and testimony., But there isn't so much as a creature here even to whisper such an, intention to. Nothing lifts its hand in these islands save blackguard, party politics. Criticism is of an abject density and puerility--it, doesn't exist--it writes the intellect of our race too low. Lang, in the, D.N., every morning, and I believe in a hundred other places, uses his, beautiful thin facility to write everything down to the lowest level of, Philistine twaddle--the view of the old lady round the corner or the, clever person at the dinner party. The incorporated society of authors, (I belong to it, and so do you, I think, but I don't know what it is), gave a dinner the other night to American literati to thank them for, praying for international copyright. I carefully forbore to go, thinking, the gratulation premature, and I see by this morning's _Times_ that the, banquetted boon is further off than ever. Edmund Gosse has sent me his, clever little life of Congreve, just out, and I have read it--but it, isn't so good as his Raleigh. But no more was the insufferable, subject.... Come, my dear Louis, grow not too thin. I can't question, you--because, as I say, I don't conjure you up. You have killed the, imagination in me--that part of it which formed your element and in, which you sat vivid and near. Your wife and Mother and Mr. Lloyd suffer, also--I must confess it--by this failure of breath, of faith. Of course, I have your letter--from Manasquan (is that the idiotic name?) of, the--ingenuous me, to think there was a date! It was terribly, impersonal--it did me little good. A little more and I shan't believe in, you enough to bless you. Take this, therefore, as your last chance. I, follow all with an aching wing, an inadequate geography and an, ineradicable hope. Ever, my dear Louis, yours, to the last snub--\\n\\nI think (or rather I am sure,) advice and direction. I have entered, upon evil days--but this is for your most private ear. It sounds, portentous, but it only means that I am still staggering a good deal, under the mysterious and (to me) inexplicable injury, wrought--apparently--upon my situation by my two last novels, the, _Bostonians_ and the _Princess_, from which I expected so much and, derived so little. They have reduced the desire, and the demand, for my, productions to zero--as I judge from the fact that though I have for a, good while past been writing a number of good short things, I remain, irremediably unpublished. Editors keep them back, for months and years\\n\\nof a grandly tragic sort, that I can conceive. Her Sundays seem rather, dingy and calculated to remind one of Concord 'historical games' etc., But it was both strange and sweet to see poor Turgenev acting charades, of the most extravagant description, dressed out in old shawls and, masks, going on all fours etc. The charades are their usual Sunday, evening occupation and the good faith with which Turgenev, at his age, and with his glories, can go into them is a striking example of that, spontaneity which Europeans have and we have not.
