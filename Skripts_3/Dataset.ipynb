vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait en m'envoyant sapho je vous suis tres-reconnaissant de cette bonne et amicale pensee qui s'ajoutera desormais pour moi au souvenir du livre je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivee de votre volume pour le lire mais cela donne l'occasion de remettre encore et de tirer un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages m'ont laissees je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions dans leur plenitude dans la crainte de ne reussir qu deformer pensee tout autant que la votre un nouveau livre de vous fait passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idees que je vous confierais de vive voix et de grand coeur si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus souvent pour le moment je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient de vous compte pour moi comme un grand evenement une jouissance rare et fructueuse je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans d'autres mais vous charmez vous m'enlevez toujours et votre maniere penetre plus

aussi serieux que celui-la n besoin d'etre rassure par personne ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager moi-meme que je constate dans sapho encore une preuve ajouter celles que vous avez donnees de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir comme revelation de la vie et du drole de melange que nous sommes la fille est etudiee avec une patience merveilleuse c'est un de ces portraits qui epuisent un type je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune homme un peu sacrifie comme etude et comme recherche sa figure paraissant moins eclairee en comparaison de celle de la femme qu'il ne le faudrait pour l'nteret moral la valeur tragique j'aurais voulu que vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par ou il passe en matiere d'experience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries avec fanny en
