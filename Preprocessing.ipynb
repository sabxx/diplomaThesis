Of course, that may have, been his joke; but in any case I cannot see how just one glass--I wonder, could I have taken more than one glass while he was talking.\\\" It was a, point that worried Mr. Korner.\\n\\nThe \\\"he\\\" who had talked, possibly, to such bad effect was a distant, cousin of Mr. Korner's, one Bill Damon, chief mate of the steamship, _La Fortuna_. Until their chance meeting that afternoon in Leadenhall, Street, they had not seen each other since they were boys together. The, _Fortuna_ was leaving St. Katherine's Docks early the next morning bound, for South America, and it might be years before they met again. As Mr., Damon pointed out, Fate, by thus throwing them into each other's arms\\n\\n\\\"Sorry I am late,\\\" said Mr. Korner, bursting cheerfully into the room., It was a point with Mr. Korner always to be cheerful in the morning., \\\"Greet the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing,\\\" was, the motto Mrs. Korner, this day a married woman of six months and three, weeks standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on, precisely two hundred and two occasions. The Motto entered largely into, the scheme of Mr. Korner's life. Written in fine copperplate upon cards, all of the same size, a choice selection counselled him each morning, from the rim of his shaving-glass.\\n\\n\\\"You sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached, eggs, while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table. At, the end of it, seeing you had gone to sleep yourself, I persuaded her, to go to bed. It was three o'clock, and we thought you would not mind.\\\", Miss Greene drew up a chair, and, with her elbows on the table, looked, across at Mr. Korner. Decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of Mrs., Korner's bosom friend.\\n\\nMr. Korner sat up suddenly and looked about him. This was not bed., The fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the, tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A, tingling sensation about his head called for investigation. Mr. Korner, was forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a, salad of him--somebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard. A, sound directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.\\n\\nThe sight of Acacia Villa, suggesting that everybody was in bed and, asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife would have been, sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting, on the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As, the door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring., The window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.\\n\\nit suddenly occurred to Mr. Korner that he was an unappreciated man., Mrs. Korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which, the beauties of the Southern Main endeavoured feebly to express their, consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no way--as far as he could, see--to Mr. Korner himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner, did say and did do, tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes. Noticing that, a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and, hurried on. Pacing the platform of the Mansion House Station, where, it is always draughty, the thought of his wrongs returned to him with, renewed force. Why was there no trace of doglike devotion about Mrs., Korner? The fault--so he bitterly told himself--the fault was his., \\\"A woman loves her master; it is her instinct,\\\" mused Mr. Korner to, himself. \\\"Damme,\\\" thought Mr. Korner, \\\"I don't believe that half her, time she knows I am her master.\\\"\\n\\nThe two friends talked of many things. And later on they spoke of, sweethearts and of wives. Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been, wide and varied. They talked--or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr., Korner listened--of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of, the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian, valleys. The mate had theories concerning the care and management of, women: theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood, the test of studied application. A new world opened out to Mr. Korner;, a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who\",\n          \"and such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you., You said what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered, to no one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost, like a gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the, devil himself. Why should you? While your cousin Philip, with his, parrot talk and sneaking ways, turned my stomach. I was sick of him\\n\\nScarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon Mrs., Manners. Her first care, and Dorothy's, was to catechise me most, particularly on my state. And whilst they were so occupied Mr. Marmaduke, entered, wholly frenzied from fright, and utterly oblivious to his own, blame in the matter. He was sent out again directly. After that, with, Aunt Lucy to assist, they hurriedly packed what few things might be, taken. The costly relics of Arlington Street were untouched, and the, French clock was left on the mantel to tick all the night, and for days, to come, in a silent and forsaken room; or perhaps to greet impassively, the King's officers when they broke in at the door. But I caught my lady, in the act of wrapping up the Wedgwood cups and dishes.\\n\\nalways chosen by my lady herself. There I sat by the hour, swathed in, many layers of wool, and tended by her hands alone. Every nook and, cranny of our lives were revealed to the other. She loved to hear of, Patty and my years at Gordon's, and would listen with bated breath to the, stories of the Ranger and the Bonhomme Richard, and of that strange man, whom we both loved, whose genius had made those cruises famous., Sometimes, in low voices, we talked of our future; but often, when the, wind blew and the deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters, a, silence would fall between us that needed no word to interpret.\\n\\nlaunching forth at once, nothing daunted by such cold conservatism., \\\"What Israelite brickmaker of Pharaoh's dreamed of Solomon's temple?, Nay, Moses himself had no conception of it. And God will send us our, pillars of cloud and of fire. We must be reconciled to our great, destiny, Mr. Carroll. No fight ever was won by man or nation content, with half a victory. We have forests to build an hundred armadas, and I, will command a fleet and it is given me.\\\"\\n\\nNot a sound came from Dorothy, nor did I dare to look at her face. The, whole matter was clear to me now. After his conversation with me, Mr., Marmaduke had lost no time in seeing Mr. Dix, in order to raise money on, my prospects. And the man of business had gone straight to Grafton with, the intelligence. The suspicion flashed through me that Mr. Allen had, been sent to spy, but his very next words disarmed it.\\n\\nThen a cry came floating down from aloft. Thrice did I hear it, like one, waking out of a sleep, ere I grasped its import. \\\"The Alliance! The, Alliance!\\\" But hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the, ship, when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft, forward. \\\"She rakes us! She rakes us!\\\" And the French soldiers tumbled, headlong down from the poop with a wail of \\\"Les Anglais font prise!\\\", \\\"Her Englishmen have taken her, and turned her guns against us!\\\" Our, captain was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and, stripes waved black in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what, happened next. The gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down, his face, shouting that the Richard was sinking, and yelling for quarter, as he made for the ensign-staff on the poop, for the flag was shot away., Him the commodore felled with a pistol-butt. At the gunner's heels were, the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken, released by the master at, arms. They swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of, Tartars, unkempt and wild and desperate with fear, until I thought that, the added weight on the scarce-supported deck would land us all in the, bilges. Words fail me when I come to describe the frightful panic of, these creatures, frenzied by the instinct of self-preservation. They, surged hither and thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a, storm-swept coast. They trampled rough-shod over the moaning heaps of, wounded and dying, and crowded the crews at the guns, who were powerless, before their numbers. Some fought like maniacs, and others flung, themselves into the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, \\\"you have not dined, and neither have I. We shall be, merry to-day, and you shall have some of the best Madeira in the, colonies.\\\" I commanded a room, that we might have privacy. As he took, his seat opposite me I marked that he had grown heavier and more browned., But his eye had the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore. And, first I upbraided him for not having writ me.\\n\\nThe door creaked, and in my eagerness I tried to lift myself. 'Twas Aunt, Lucy's hand that restrained me, and the next face I saw was that of, Dorothy's mother. But why did it appear so old and sorrow-lined? And, why was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap? She took, my fingers in her own, and asked me anxiously if I felt any pain.\\n\\n\\\"Despite the host of troubles he had on his hands, your commodore himself, came with us to Rotterdam. Now I protest I love that man, who has more, humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in England who call him, hard names. If you could have seen him leaning over you, and speaking to, you, and feeling every minute for your heart-beats, egad, you would have, cried. And when I took you off to the schooner, he gave me an hundred, directions how to care for you, and then his sorrow bowled him all in a, heap.\\\"\\n\\nWhen I came on deck the next morning our yards were a-drip with a clammy, fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze. We were, standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused, in the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, and that we, were near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all, that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though, we had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my, eyes through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our, starboard beam.\\n\\nMrs. Manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to Carvel Hall. It was, on a sparkling morning in February that we sighted the familiar toe of, Kent Island, and the good-natured skipper put about and made for the, mouth of our river. Then, as of old, the white cupola of Carvel House, gleamed a signal of greeting, to which our full hearts beat a silent, response. Once again the great windmill waved its welcome, and the same, memory was upon us both as we gazed. Of a hale old gentleman in the, sheets of a sailing pinnace, of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering, with excitement of the days to come. Dorothy gently pressed my hand as, the bark came into the wind, and the boat was dropped into the green, water. Slowly they lowered me into it, for I was still helpless, Dorothy, and her mother and Aunt Lucy were got down, and finally Mr. Marmaduke, stepped gingerly from the sea-ladder over the gunwale. The cutter leaped, under the strong strokes up the river with the tide. Then, as we rounded, the bend, we were suddenly astonished to see people gathered on the, landing at the foot of the lawn, where they had run, no doubt, in a, flurry at sight of the ship below. In the front of the group stood, out a strangely familiar figure.\\n\\nFifty and five minutes had been registered by the French clock, when the, rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below, and Charles Fox, panted up the stairs, muffled in a huge wrap-rascal. 'Twas he and Aunt, Lucy carried me down to the street, Dorothy walking at my side, and, propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting., This was an ample travelling-carriage with a lamp hanging from its top\\n\\nSuddenly, glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were, aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big, Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great, ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the, mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes, sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the, commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our, guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.\\n\\nBefore we could answer he was gone into the night; and my Lord, standing, without, had closed the carriage door. And that was the last I saw of, this noble man, the true friend of America, who devoted his glorious, talents and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the, greatness of England. He who was followed by the prayers of the English, race was ever remembered in our own humble ones.\\n\\nwaited on by the old servants of my grandfather. At our whim my chair, would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts; on cool days, we sat in the sun by the dial, where the flowers mingled their odours, with the salt breezes off the Chesapeake; or anon, when it was warmer, in, the summer-house my mother loved, or under the shade of the great trees, on the lawn, looking out over the river. And once my lady went off very, mysteriously, her eyes brimful of mischief, to come back with the first, strawberries of the year staining her apron.\\n\\nLord Comyn and Mr. Fox. They may do something for you, now you own your, estate. My dear sir, I dislike to say aught against any man. Mrs., Manners will tell you of their kindness to us, but I vow I have not been, able to see it. With all the money at their command they will not loan, me a penny in my pressing need. And I shame to say it, my own daughter, prevents me from obtaining the money to keep us out of the Fleet. I know, she has spoken to Dulany. Think of it, Richard, my own daughter, upon, whom I lavished all when I had it, who might have made a score of grand, matches when I gave her the opportunity, and now we had all been rolling, in wealth. I'll be sworn I don't comprehend her, nor her mother either\\n\\n\\\"I have seen many men since, but never have I met your equal for a most, damnable frankness, Richard Carvel. Even Jack, here, is not half so, blunt and uncompromising. But you took my fancy--God knows why!--that, first night I clapped eyes on you in Arlington Street, and I loved you, when your simplicity made us that speech at Brooks's Club. So you have, not forgotten that morning under the trees, when the dew was on the, grass. Faith, I am glad of it. What children we were!\\\" he said, and, sighed.\\n\\nthough not very handsomely. Fears for my own safety alone kept me from, telling you and Mr. Swain. And I swear to you that I was sorry for the, venture almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling., The scheme was laid out before I took you for a pupil; indeed, that was, part of it, as you no doubt have guessed. As God hears me, I learned to, love you, Richard, in those days at the rectory. You were all of a man\\n\\n\\\"Ay, he's back,\\\" he returned, with a grunt that was half a growl; \\\"arter, three weeks breakin' o' liberty. I tell 'ee what, sir, them Frenchies is, treecherous devils, an' not to be trusted the len'th of a lead line. An', they beant seamen eno' to keep a full an' by with all their 'takteek'., Ez fer that Landais, I hearn him whinin' at the commodore in the round, house when we was off Clear, an' sayin' as how he would tell Sartin on us, when he gets back to Paree. An' jabberin to th'other Frenchmen as was, there that this here butter-cask was er King's ship, an' that the, commodore weren't no commodore nohow. They say as how Cap'n Jones be, bound up in a hard knot by some articles of agreement, an' daresn't, punish him. Be that so, Mr. Carvel?\\\"\\n\\nAs few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of Charles, James Fox and of John Paul Jones. The latter hero actually made a voyage, in the brigantine 'John' about the time he picked up Richard Carvel from, the Black Moll, after the episode with Mungo Maxwell at Tobago. The, Scotch scene, of course, is purely imaginary. Accuracy has been aimed at, in the account of the fight between the 'Bonhomme Richard' and the, 'Serapis', while a little different arrangement might have been better, for the medium of the narrative. To be sure, it was Mr. Mease, the, purser, instead of Richard Carvel, who so bravely fought the quarter-deck, guns; and in reality Midshipman Mayrant, Commodore Jones's aide, was, wounded by a pike in the thigh after the surrender. No injustice is done, to the second and third lieutenants, who were absent from the ship during, the action.\\n\\n\\\"You will cherish her, Richard,\\\" he said brokenly, \\\"for her like is not, to be found in this world. I knew her worth when first she came to, London, as arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance. I saw then that a, great love alone was needed to make her the highest among women, and from, the night I fought with you at the Coffee House I have felt upon whom, that love would fall. O thou of little faith,\\\" he cried, \\\"what little I, may have done has been for her. No, Richard, you do not deserve her, but, I would rather think of her as your wife than that of any man living.\\\"\\n\\nI cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after Mr. Swain's death., One hope had lightened all the years of my servitude. For, when I, examined my soul, I knew that it was for Dorothy I had laboured. And, every letter that came from Comyn telling me she was still free gave me, new heart for my work. By some mystic communion--I know not what--I felt, that she loved me yet, and despite distance and degree. I would wake of, a morning with the knowledge of it, and be silent for half the day with, some particle of a dream in my head, lingering like the burden of a song, with its train of memories.\\n\\nIn the meantime the American frigate 'Alliance' had brought Lafayette to, France, and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the, 'Bon homme Richard'. One of the most fatal mistakes Congress ever made, was to put Captain Pierre Landais in command of her, out of compliment to, the French allies. He was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to, get him a command in his own navy. His insulting conduct and treachery, to Captain Jones are strongly attested to in Mr. Carvel's manuscript:, they were amply proved by the written statements of other officers.\\n\\n\\\"A hawser, Mr. Stacey, a hawser!\\\" I heard the commodore shout, and saw, the sailing-master slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and, wounded and mass of broken spars and tackles, and finally pick up a, smeared rope's end, which I helped him drag to the poop. There we found, the commodore himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the, severed stays and shrouds dangling from the bowsprit, the French marines, looking on.\\n\\n\\\"No one knows of it, Richard, or is likely to. Dr. Barry, like so many, in England, is a good Whig and friend to America. And you are in a part, of London far removed from Mayfair.\\\" She hesitated, and then continued, in a voice that strove to be lighter: \\\"This little house is in Charlotte, Street, Mary-le-Bone, for the war has made all of us suffer some. And we, are more fortunate than many, for we are very comfortable here, and, though I say it, happier than in Arlington Street. And the best of our, friends are still faithful. Mr. Fox, with all his greatness, has never, deserted us, nor my Lord Comyn. Indeed, we owe them much more than I can, tell you of now,\\\" she said, and sighed. \\\"They are here every day of the, world to inquire for you, and it was his Lordship brought you out of, Holland.\\\"\\n\\nA master might picture my happiness, waking and sleeping, through the, short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light. The, memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe, a little more rounded, than of yore, and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the, world's mysteries. Dorothy had looked the lady in rags, and housewife's, cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades. When for any, reason she was absent from my side, I moped, to the quiet amusement of, Mrs. Manners and the more boisterous delight of Aunt Lucy, who took her, turn sewing in the window. I was near to forgetting the use of words\\n\\nNo one may read the annals of these men, who were at once brave and, courtly, and of these women, who were ladies by nature as well as by, birth, and not love them. The fascination of that free and hospitable, life has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it, with a genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to, the pleasure he has derived from the history of Maryland.\\n\\nThe squadron sailed from L'Orient in June, but owing to a collision, between the Bon homme Richard and the Alliance it was forced to put back, into the Groix roads for repairs. Nails and rivets were with difficulty, got to hold in the sides of the old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul, Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels:, Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve;, and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed, upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have, absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf, parted company, never to return. After the most outrageous conduct off, the coast of Ireland, Landais, in the 'Alliance', left the squadron on, September 6th, and did not reappear until the 23d, the day of the battle.\\n\\nBefore Christmas we went to the Eastern Shore. In Annapolis fife and, drum had taken the place of fiddle and clarion; militia companies were, drilling in the empty streets; despatches were arriving daily from the, North; and grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings. But if the war was, to come, I must settle what was to be done at Gordon's Pride with all, possible speed. It was only a few days after our going there, that I, rode into Oxford with a black cockade in my hat Patty had made me, and, the army sword Captain Jack had given Captain Daniel at my side. For I, had been elected a lieutenant in the Oxford company, of which Percy, Singleton was captain.\\n\\nI smiled, but more in sadness than amusement. Hardship had only degraded, Mr. Marmaduke the more, and even in trouble his memory was convenient as, is that of most people in prosperity. I was of no mind to jog his, recollection. But I wanted badly to ask about his Grace. Where had my, fine nobleman been at the critical point of his friend's misfortunes?, For I had had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk, with McAndrews.\\n\\n\\\"I came here to-night to betray you, and might have gone hence to your, uncle to claim my pieces of silver. I remain to tell you that Grafton, has an appointment at nine with his Majesty's chief Secretary of State., I need not mention his motives, nor dwell upon your peril. For the, King's sentiments toward Paul Jones are well known. You must leave, London without delay, and so must Mr. Manners and his family.\\\"\\n\\npresently to be pieced together. The injuries Mr. Marmaduke had done me, were the first to collect, since I was searching for the cause of my, resentment against him. The incidents arrived haphazard as magic, lanthorn views, but very vivid. His denial of me before Mr. Dix, and his, treachery at Vauxhall, when he had sent me to be murdered. Next I felt, myself clutching the skin over his ribs in Arlington Street, when I had, flung him across the room in his yellow night-gown. That brought me to, the most painful scene of my life, when I had parted with Dorothy at the, top of the stairs. Afterward followed scraps of the years at Gordon's, Pride, and on top of them the talk with McAndrews. Here was the secret, I sought. The crash had come. And they were no longer in Mayfair, but, must have taken a house in some poorer part of London. This thought cast, me down tremendously.\\n\\n\\\"Orchardson died before I had made one voyage,\\\" he replied, \\\"and the, Betsy changed owners. But I did not forget you, Richard, and was, resolved but now not to leave Maryland until I had seen you. But I burn, to hear of you,\\\" he added. \\\"I have had an inkling of your story from the, landlord. So your grandfather is dead, and that blastie, your uncle, of, whom you told me on the John, is in possession.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and, stripes over a man-o'-war. They got away on November 14, 1777, with a, fair crew and a poor lot of officers. Mr. Carvel had many a brush with, the mutinous first lieutenant Simpson. Family influence deterred the, captain from placing this man under arrest, and even Dr. Franklin found, trouble, some years after, in bringing about his dismissal from the, service. To add to the troubles, the Ranger proved crank and, slow-sailing; and she had only one barrel of rum aboard, which made, the men discontented.\\n\\nThose of us who had clung to hope lost it then. Standing with my back, to the mast, beating them off with a pike, visions of an English, prison-ship, of an English gallows, came before me. I counted the, seconds until the enemy's seamen would be pouring through our ragged, ports. The seventh and last time, and we were beaten, for we had not men, enough left on our two decks to force them down again. Yes,--I shame to, confess it--the heart went clean out of me, and with that the pain, pulsed and leaped in my head like a devil unbound. At a turn of the hand, I should have sunk to the boards, had not a voice risen strong and clear, above that turmoil, compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps.\\n\\n\\\"And now I shall tell you something of the story of the Duke of, Chartersea,\\\" she went on, and I felt her tremble as she spoke that name., \\\"I think of all we have Lord Comyn to thank for, next to saving your life, twice, was his telling you of the danger I ran. And, Richard, after, refusing you that day on the balcony over the Park, I had no hope left., You may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in London, after that. Richard,\\\" she said, \\\"do you recall my asking you in the, coach, on the way from Castle Yard, for the exact day you met my father, in Arlington Street?\\\"\\n\\nand then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet. For the old, archness, at least, would never be eradicated. Presently, after she had, taken the cup and smoothed my pillow, I reached out for her hand. It was, a boldness of which I had not believed myself capable; but she did not, resist, and even, as I thought, pressed my fingers with her own slender, ones, the red of our Maryland holly blushing in her cheeks. And what, need of words, indeed! Our thoughts, too, flew coursing hand in hand, through primrose paths, and the angels themselves were not to be envied.\\n\\n\\\"And I possessed the love of such a woman, Richard,\\\" he said, in another, tone, \\\"I think I should die of happiness. She will never tell you how, these weeks past she has scarce left your side. The threats combined, of her mother and the doctor, and Charles and me, would not induce her, to take any sleep. And time and time have I walked from here to Brook, Street without recognizing a step of the way, lifted clear out of myself, by the sight of her devotion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are always finding friends, Richard,\\\" said he; \\\"no matter what your, misfortunes, they are ever double discounted. As for me; I am like, Fulmer in Mr. Cumberland's 'West Indian': 'I have beat through every, quarter of the compass; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to, serve my country; I have'--I am engaging to betray it. No, Scotland is, no longer my country, and so I cannot betray her. It is she who has, betrayed me.\\\"\\n\\nMy own duties took me to the dark lower deck, a vile place indeed, and, reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals. There I had charge of, the battery of old eighteens, while Mr. Dale commanded the twelves on the, middle deck. We loaded our guns with two shots apiece, though I had my, doubts about their standing such a charge, and then the men stripped, until they stood naked to the waist, waiting for the fight to begin. For, we could see nothing of what was going forward. I was pacing up and, down, for it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the, gun-ports closed, when about three bells of the dog, Mr. Mease, the, purser, appeared on the ladder.\\n\\nThat the rough and bluff captains of the American service should have, regarded a man of Paul Jones's type with suspicion is not surprising., They resented his polish and accomplishments, and could not understand, his language. Perhaps it was for this reason, as well as a reward for, his brilliant services, that he was always given a separate command. In, the summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power, of the United States, nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate, 'Indien', then building at Amsterdam. And he was ordered to France in, command of the 'Ranger', a new ship then fitting at Portsmouth. Captain, Jones was the admiration of all the young officers in the navy, and was, immediately flooded with requests to sail with him. One of his first, acts, after receiving his command, was to apply to the Marine Committee, for Mr. Carvel. The favour was granted.\\n\\n\\\"We are not yet an infant state, sir,\\\" Mr. Carroll put in, with a shade, of rebuke. For Maryland was well content with the government she had, enjoyed, and her best patriots long after shunned the length of, secession. \\\"I believe and pray that the King will come to his senses., And as for the navy, it is folly. How can we hope to compete with, England on the sea?\\\"\\n\\nrolling his quid to show his pleasure of the topic, \\\"they sits on their, bottoms in Brest and L'Oriong an' talks takteek wi' their han's and, mouths, and daresn't as much as show the noses o' their three-deckers in, th' Bay o' Biscay, while Cap'n Jones pokes his bowsprit into every port, in England with a hulk the rats have left. I've had my bellyful o', Frenchies, Mr. Carvell save it be to fight 'em. An' I tell 'ee 'twould, give me the greatest joy in life t' leave loose 'Scolding Sairy' at that, there Landais. Th' gal ain't had a match on her this here cruise, an' t', my mind she couldn't be christened better, sir.\\\"\\n\\nThe boatswains' whistles trilled through the ship, pikes were seized, and, pistol and cutlass buckled on. But even as we waited with set teeth, our, bows ground into the enemy's weather quarter-gallery. For the Richard's, rigging was much cut away, and she was crank at best. So we backed and, filled once more, passing the Englishman close aboard, himself being, aback at the time. Several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in, front of me, shattering a nine-pounder and killing half of its crew. And, it is only a miracle that I stand alive to be able to tell the tale., Then I caught a glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our, wheel, and over went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the, 'Serapis', where we might rake and rush her decks. Our old Indiaman, answered but doggedly; and the huge bowsprit of the Serapis, towering, over our heads, snapped off our spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen, rigging.\\n\\nAs a result of that trip he got the Duras, which he renamed the 'Bon, homme Richard' in honour of Dr. Franklin. The Duras was an ancient, Indiaman with a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw, her, at the remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy. She was, perfectly rotten, and in the constructor's opinion not worth refitting., Her lowest deck (too low for the purpose) was pierced aft with three, ports on a side, and six worn-out eighteen-pounders mounted there. Some, of them burst in the action, killing their people. The main battery, on, the deck above, was composed of twenty-eight twelve-pounders. On the, uncovered deck eight nine-pounders were mounted. Captain Jones again, showed his desire to serve the cause by taking such a ship, and not, waiting for something better.\\n\\nmy old tutor, and rector of St. Anne's. And 'twas a baffling, intangible, change. 'Twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face, for he was now, just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul. The, coarse wine and coarse food of the lower coffee-houses of London had, replaced the rich and abundant fare of Maryland. The next day was become, one of the terrors of his life. His clothes were of poor stuff, but, aimed at the fashion. And yet--and yet, as I looked upon him, a, something was in his face to puzzle me entirely. I had seen many stamps, of men, but this thing I could not recognize.\\n\\n\\\"You will not believe him, Richard,\\\" cried my Lord; \\\"you have only to, look at him to see that he lies. Take note of the ragged uniform of the, rebel army he carries, and then think of him 'en petite maitre', with his, cabriolet and his chestnuts. Egad, he might be as rich as Rigby were it, not for those principles which he chooses to deride. And I have seen him, reduced to a crown for them. I tell you, Richard,\\\" said my Lord, \\\"by, espousing your cause Charles is become greater than the King. For he, has the hearts of the English people, which George has not, and the, allegiance of you Americans, which George will never have. And if you, once heard him, in Parliament, you should hear him now, and see the, Speaker wagging his wig like a man bewitched, and hear friends and, enemies calling out for him to go on whenever he gives the sign of a, pause.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ill uncos, sir,\\\" he answered, shaking his head with violence. He had, indeed but a sorry tale for my ear, and one to make my heart heavier than, it was. McAndrews opened his mind to me, and seemed the better for it., How Mr. Marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was, more than the honest Scotchman could imagine. There was a country place, in Sussex now, said he, that was the latest. And drafts were coming in, before the wheat was in the ear; and the plantations of tobacco on the, Western Shore had been idle since the non-exportation, and were mortgaged, to their limit to Mr. Willard. Money was even loaned on the Wilmot House, estate. McAndrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither Mrs. Manners nor, Miss Dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs.\\n\\n\\\"Now, and never again, dear,\\\" she said. \\\"Yes, I saw and heard all that, passed in the drawing-room. And I did not blame, but praised you for it., I have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since. God, forgive me!\\\" she cried, \\\"but I have despised him from that hour. When, I knew that he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute, working, upon me to save his honour, of which he has not the smallest spark; that, he had recognized and denied you, friendless before our house, and sent, you into the darkness at Vauxhall to be murdered, then he was no father, of mine. I would that you might know what my mother has suffered from, such a man, Richard.\\\"\\n\\nIf the divine power of genius ever made itself felt, 'twas on that May, evening, at candle-light, in the Annapolis Coffee House. With my own, eyes I witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province, thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight, and twenty. As for good Captain Daniel, enthusiasm is but a poor word to, express his feelings. A map was sent for and spread out upon the table., And it was a late hour when Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll went home\\n\\nThe author makes most humble apologies to any who have, or think they, have, an ancestor in this book. He has drawn the foregoing with a very, free hand, and in the Maryland scenes has made use of names rather than, of actual personages. His purpose, however poorly accomplished, was to, give some semblance of reality to this part of the story. Hence he has, introduced those names in the setting, choosing them entirely at random, from the many prominent families of the colony.\\n\\nThey were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking, hatches, and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a, desperate vigour. Then, all at once, the towering mainmast of the enemy, cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds., The first intense silence of the battle followed, in the midst of which, came a cry from our top:\\n\\nNor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the Atlantic., We reached Lisbon in safety, and after a week of lodgings in that city by, the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for Baltimore. For, the Chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war, and kept alive the, credit of the young nation. There were many excitements ere we sighted, the sand-spits of Virginia, and off the Azores we were chased for a day, and a night by a British sloop of war. Our captain, however, was a cool, man and a seaman, and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the, Capes very triumphantly.\\n\\n\\\"What plan, sir!\\\" said Captain John Paul, those wonderful eyes of his, alight. \\\"In the first place, we Americans build the fastest ships in the, world,--yours of the Chesapeake are as fleet as any. Here, if I am not, mistaken, one hundred and eighty-two were built in the year '71. They, are idle now. To them I would issue letters of marque, to harry, England's trade. From Carolina to Maine we have the wood and iron to, build cruisers, in harbours that may not easily be got at. And skilled, masters and seamen to elude the enemy.\\\"\\n\\nMy heart bled for him. Some minutes passed that he did not speak, making, shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by, a strong emotion. \\\"'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was, greatest. Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles, in his coat, and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on, since Dolly and he and I had stood together on the Betsy's deck.\\n\\nWhen next consciousness came, the tarry, salt smell of a ship was in my, nostrils, and I knew that we were embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a, fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and, the tramp of feet on the deck above my head. Framed against the, irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water, beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.\\n\\nand the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead. At last, when I, was getting fairly restless, the distant tones of a voice, deep and, reverberating, smote upon my ear, jarring painfully some long-forgotten, chord. That voice belonged to but one man alive, and yet I could not, name him. Even as I strained, the tones drew nearer, and they were mixed, with sweeter ones I knew well, and Dorothy's mother's voice. Whilst I, was still searching, the door opened, the voices fell calm, and Dorothy, came in bearing a candle in each hand. As she set them down on the, table, I saw an agitation in her face, which she strove to hide as she, addressed me.\\n\\nThe scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning. A knot of, midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing Landais's conduct, and, cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up, short. Mr. Stacey, the sailing-master, had the deck, and the coasting, pilot was conning; now and anon the boatswain's whistle piped for Garrett, or Quito or Fogg to lay aft to the mast, where the first lieutenant stood, talking to Colonel de Chamillard, of the French marines. The scavengers, were sweeping down, and part of the after guard was bending a new, bolt-rope on a storm staysail.\\n\\nMr. Carvel's chapter opens with Landais's sudden reappearance on the, morning of the day the battle was fought. He shows the resentment and, anger against the Frenchman felt by all on board, from cabin-boy to, commodore. But none went so far as to accuse the captain of the, 'Alliance' of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action., Cowardice may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from, the two duels in which the Richard and the Pallas engaged. But the fact, that he poured broadsides into the Richard, and into her off side, makes, it seem probable that his motive was to sink the commodore's ship, and so, get the credit of saving the day, to the detriment of the hero who won it, despite all disasters. To account for the cry that was raised when first, she attacked the Richard, it must be borne in mind that the crew of the, 'Alliance' was largely composed of Englishmen. It was thought that these, had mutinied and taken her.\\n\\nAt noon, when I relieved Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun had eaten up the, fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming, up across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind, us. I had the starboard watch piped to dinner, and reported twelve, o'clock to the commodore. And had just got permission to \\\"make it,\\\", according to a time-honoured custom at sea, when another \\\"Sail, ho!\\\" came, down from aloft.\\n\\n\\\"Charles,\\\" I said, \\\"this is all of a piece with your old recklessness., You were ever one to take any risk, but I will not hear of such a venture, as this. Do you think I will allow the hope of all England to be staked, for a pirate? And would you break our commander of her rank? All that, Dorothy need do at Portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she, meets, and I'll warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain,\\\" I said to my old friend, \\\"I have a rare joy this day in making, known to you Mr. John Paul Jones, of whom I have spoken to you a score of, times. He it is whose bravery sank the Black Moll, whose charity took me, to London, and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in, a debtors' prison. For his honour, as I have told you, would allow him, to accept none, nor his principles to take the commission in the Royal, Navy which Mr. Fox offered him.\\\"\\n\\nThe room had a prodigious sense of change about it. That came over me, with something of a shock, since the moment before I had it settled that, I was in Marlboro' Street. The bare branches swaying in the wind outside, should belong to the trees in Freshwater Lane. But beyond the branches, were houses, the like of which I had no remembrance of in Annapolis. And, then my grandfather should be sitting in that window. Surely, he was, there! He moved! He was coming toward me to say: \\\"Richard, you are, forgiven,\\\" and to brush his eyes with his ruffles.\\n\\nShe closed the door softly behind her, and stood looking down upon me, with such a wondrous love-light in her eyes as no man may describe., My fancy had not lifted me within its compass, my dreams even had not, imagined it. And the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler, souls. So she stood gazing, those lips which once had been the seat of, pride now parted in a smile of infinite tenderness. But her head she, still held high, and her body straight. Down the front of her dress fell, a tucked apron of the whitest linen, and in her hand was a cup of, steaming broth.\\n\\nmy dear. Well, when the big British fleet sailed up the bay in '77, your, precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality., He began to correspond with the British at Philadelphia, and one of his, letters was captured near the Head of Elk. A squad was sent to the Kent, estate, where he had been living, to arrest him, but he made his escape, to New York. And his lands were at once confiscated by the state.\\\"\\n\\nBringing the official news of Burgoyne's surrender, which was to cause, King Louis to acknowledge the independence of the United States, the, Ranger arrived at Nantes, December 2. Mr. Carvel accompanied Captain, Jones to Paris, where a serious blow awaited him. The American, Commissioners informed him that the Indien had been transferred to France, to prevent her confiscation. That winter John Paul spent striving in, vain for a better ship, and imbibing tactics from the French admirals., Incidentally, he obtained a salute for the American flag. The cruise of, the Ranger in English waters the following spring was a striking, fulfilment, with an absurdly poor and inadequate force, of the plan set, forth by John Paul Jones in the Annapolis Coffee House. His descent upon, Whitehaven spread terror and consternation broadcast through England, and, he was branded as a pirate and a traitor. Mr. Carvel was fortunately not, of the landing party on St. Mary's Isle, which place he had last beheld, in John Paul's company, on the brigantine John, when entering, Kirkcudbright. The object of that expedition, as is well known, was to, obtain the person of the Earl of Selkirk, in order to bring about the, rescue of the unfortunate Americans suffering in British prisons. After, the celebrated capture of the sloop-of-war Drake, Paul Jones returned to, France a hero.\\n\\nAll that morning I pondered over the devious lane of my life, which had, led up to so fair a garden. And one thing above all kept turning and, turning in my head, until I thought I should die of waiting for its, fulfilment. Now was I free to ask Dorothy to marry me, to promise her, the ease and comfort that had once been hers, should God bring us safe, back to Maryland. The change in her was little less than a marvel to me\\n\\n\\\"'Ods! Blest if I know what he is,\\\" says Mr. Claude. \\\"He may be, anything, an impostor or a high-mightiness. But he's something to strike, the eye and hold it, for all his Quaker clothes. He is swarth and, thickset, and some five feet eight inches--full six inches under your, own height. And he comes asking for you as if you owned the town between, you. 'Send a fellow to Marlboro' Street for Mr. Richard Carvel, my good, host!' says he, with a snap of his fingers. And when I tell him the news, of you, he is prodigiously affected, and cries--but here's my gentleman, now!\\\"\\n\\nI arrived at Wye Island in season to dine with the good judge and his, family, and there I made over to his charge the property of Patty and her, mother. The afternoon we spent in sober talk, Mr. Bordley giving me much, sound advice, and writing me several letters of recommendation to, gentlemen in Congress. His conduct was distinguished by even more of, kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me.\\n\\n\\\"I could answer nothing. 'Twas because of her father's dying wish I, asked her, and she guessed that same. I would not tell her a lie, for, only the one woman lives whom I love, and whom I have loved ever since, we were children together among the strawberries. Need I say that that, woman is you, Dorothy? I loved you before we sailed to Carvel Hall, between my grandfather's knees, and I will love you till death claims, me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he followed Mrs. Manners out of the room, frowning and shaking his, fist at me in mock fierceness. I would have died for the man. For a, space--a prodigious long space--I lay very still, my heart bumping like a, gun-carriage broke loose, and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door., Then I caught the sound of a light footstep, the knob turned, and joy, poured into my soul with the sweep of a Fundy tide.\\n\\nOur men raised a hoarse yell, drowned all at once by the popping of, musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about, the decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to, larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the, space between the ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports., And next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them, muzzle to muzzle below, our rammers leaning into the Serapis to send, their shot home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us, in moments of suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce, to leap a cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the, English guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign\\n\\nwhich I saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort. And I, was made to take a spoonful of something. Never, I believe, was medicine, swallowed with a greater willingness. Talk was impossible, so I lay back, in the corner and looked at her; and now and anon she would glance at my, face, with a troubled guess in her own as to how I might stand the night., For we were still in London. That I knew by the trot of our horses, and, by the granite we traversed from time to time. But at length we rumbled, over a bridge, there was a sharp call back from our post-boy to him of, the chaise behind, and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying, and creaking, which was to last the whole night long, save for the brief, stops at the post-houses.\\n\\nThe rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme, Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck. Less than three score, of the seamen were American born; near four score were British, inclusive, of sixteen Irish; one hundred and thirty-seven were French soldiers, who, acted as marines; and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight, her were from all over the earth,--Malays and Maltese and Portuguese., In the hold were more than one hundred and fifty English prisoners.\\n\\ntoo, for now am I known from Mary-le-bone to Chelsea, while before my, name was unheard of out of little Mayfair. Indeed, I would not have, missed the experience for a lady-in-waiting-ship. I have learned a deal, since I saw you last, sir. I know that the world, like our Continental, money, must not be taken for the price that is stamped upon it. And as, for the watching with you,\\\" said my lady, \\\"that had to be borne with as, cheerfully as might be. Since I had sent off for you, I was in duty, bound to do my share toward your recovery. I was even going to add, that this watching was a pleasure,--our curate says the sense of duty, performed is sure to be. But you used to cry out the most terrifying, things to frighten me: the pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies, on the decks, and the black rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never, stopped; and strange, rough commands I could not understand; and the name, of your commodore whom you love so much. And often you would repeat over, and over: 'I have not yet begun, to fight, I have not yet begun to, fight!'\\\"\\n\\nThen there was the bed-canopy, the pleatings of which were gone, and it, was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That, was unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the, mantel was now but a bit of a shelf, and held many things that seemed, scarce at home on the rough and painted wood,--gold filigree; and China, and Japan, and a French clock that ought not to have been just there., Ah, the teacups! Here at last was something to touch a fibre of my, brain, but a pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back, to my grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as, Scipio's, and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too, large for him. And he was sewing. This was monstrous!\\n\\nI turned and followed him aft to the taffrail, where we were clear of the, French soldiers. The sun was hanging red over the Yorkshire Wolds, the, Head of Flamborough was in the blue shadow, and the clouds were like rose, leaves in the sky. The enemy had tacked and was standing west, with, ensign and jack and pennant flying, the level light washing his sails to, the whiteness of paper. 'Twas then I first remarked that the Alliance, had left her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the, Serapis. The commodore seemed to read my exclamation.\\n\\nI turned my face to the wall, completely overcome, and the tears scalding, in my eyes, at the thought of Dorothy and her mother bending over the, stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood, and watching at my bedside, night and day despite their weariness of body. And not a word out of, these noble women of their sacrifice, nor of the shame and trouble and, labour of their lives, who always had been used to every luxury! Nothing, but cheer had they brought to the sickroom, and not a sign of their, poverty and hardship, for they knew that their broths and biscuit and, jellies must have choked me. No. It remained for this contemptible, cur of a husband and father to open my eyes.\\n\\nstriking everywhere, sometimes sending casks of salt water over the, nettings. Incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering, sand over the black pools that kept running, running together as the, minutes were tolled out, and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces, in a hideous contortion. One little fellow, with whom I had had many a, lively word at mess, had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went, skipping past me with the charge under his coat, and I have but to listen, now to hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him, away to the cockpit below. Out of the main hatch, from that charnel, house, rose one continuous cry. It was an odd trick of the mind or soul, that put a hymn on my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human, misery, when men were calling the name of their Maker in vain. But as, I ran from crew to crew, I sang over and over again a long-forgotten, Christmas carol, and with it came a fleeting memory of my mother on the, stairs at Carvel Hall, and of the negroes gathered on the lawn without.\\n\\nI knew full well she meant it, and the terror of losing her kept me, silent. She put down the cup, placed another pillow behind my head with, a marvellous deftness, and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls, something which was surely nectar. And mine eyes, too, had their feast., Never before had I seen my lady in this gentle guise, this task of, nursing the sick, which her doing raised to a queenly art.\\n\\nSo passed that winter, the darkest of my life. One soft spring day, when, the birds were twittering amid new-born leaves, and the hyacinths and, tulips in Patty's garden were coming to their glory, Master Tom rode, leisurely down the drive at Gordon's Pride. That was a Saturday, the, 29th of April, 1775. The news which had flown southward, night and day, alike, was in no hurry to run off his tongue; he had been lolling on the, porch for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the, minute-men of Massachusetts and the British regulars, of the rout of, Percy's panting redcoats from Concord to Boston. Tom added, with the, brutal nonchalance which characterized his dealings with his mother and, sister, that he was on his way to Philadelphia to join a company.\\n\\nThe next morning, after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me, to his heart's content, enters Mr. Marmaduke Manners. I was prodigiously, struck by the change in him, and pitied him then near as much as I had, once despised him. He was arrayed in finery, as of old. But the finery, was some thing shabby; the lace was frayed at the edges, there was a neat, but obvious patch in his small-clothes, and two more in his coat. His, air was what distressed me most of all, being that of a man who spends, his days seeking favours and getting none. I had seen too many of the, type not to know the sign of it.\\n\\nto put in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once, visited. And how much of that money do you suppose I get, sir? Will you, believe it that I--\\\" (he was shrieking now), \\\"that I, the man of the, family, am allowed only my simple meals, a farthing for snuff, and not a, groat for chaise-hire? At my age I am obliged to walk to and from their, lordships' side entrances in patched clothes, egad, when a new suit might, obtain us a handsome year's income!\\\"\\n\\nWe were married on the fifteenth of June, already an anniversary for us, both, in the long drawing-room. General Clapsaddle was there from the, army to take Dorothy in his arms, even as he had embraced another bride, on the same spot in years gone by. She wore the wedding gown that was, her mother's, but when the hour was come to dress her Aunt Lucy and Aunt, Hester failed in their task, and it was Patty who performed the most of, that office, and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck.\\n\\nAt that the commodore hurried forward, the men falling back to the, bulwarks respectfully, and he mounted the fore-rigging as agile as any, topman, followed by his aide with a glass. From the masthead he sung out, to me to set our stu'nsails, and he remained aloft till near seven bells, of the watch. At that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety, behind the head, and from the deck a great yellow King's frigate could be, plainly seen standing south to meet us, followed by her smaller consort., Presently she hove to, and through our glasses we discerned a small boat, making for her side, and then a man clambering up her sea-ladder.\\n\\nIt makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that, tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the, King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that, stood so straight upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love, and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns, piped and sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the, long roll and the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive., Breechings were loosed and gun-tackles unlashed, rammer and sponge laid, out, and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy, when the time came to rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled, over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and, canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers, rigged the splinter nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes, against those that were sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of, water to put out the fires. Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is, slippery upon the boards. The French marines, their scarlet and white, very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were, mustered on poop and forecastle, and some were sent aloft to the tops to, assist the tars there to sweep the British decks with handgrenade and, musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and, steerage, to make ready for the grimmest work of all.\\n\\nI rushed back to my guns, for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of, the Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into, play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside, into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching, together, the disordered riggings locking, and both pointed northward to, a leeward tide in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to, shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.\\n\\n\\\"The duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to London., I think my father wrote of that to Dr. Courtenay.\\\" (I smiled at the, recollection, now.) \\\"Then his Grace persisted in following me, everywhere, and vowed publicly that he would marry me. I ordered him, from our house, since my father would not. At last one afternoon he came, back to dine with us, insolent to excess. I left the table. He sat with, my father two hours or more, drinking and singing, and giving orders to, the servants. I shut my door, that I might not hear. After a while my, mother came up to me, crying, saying that Mr. Manners would be branded, with dishonour and I did not consent to marry his Grace,--a most terrible, dishonour, of which she could not speak. That the duke had given my, father a month to win my consent. And that month was up, Richard, the, very afternoon you appeared with Mr. Dix in Arlington Street.\\\"\\n\\ninstead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and, prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen, gibberish of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the, first fury of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn, at the main hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had, burst, killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them., At this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches.\\n\\nbe accused of mercenary motives. The ragged crew of the Ranger was paid, in part out of his own pocket, and for a whole month he supported the, Drake's officers and men, no provision having been made for prisoners., He was at large expense in fitting out the Ranger, and he bought back at, twice what it was worth the plate taken from St. Mary's Isle, getting but, a tardy recognition from the Earl of Selkirk for such a noble and, unheard-of action. And, I take pride in writing it, Mr. Carvel spent, much of what he had earned at Gordon's Pride in a like honourable manner.\\n\\n\\\"Richard,\\\" replied he, with an ineffable sadness, \\\"I am naught but a, wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,--no, real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom, I lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life, I must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I know that, now, and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently, broken forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a wild young creature then, my dear, with little beside vanity, under my cap. And the notion that you could admire and love any girl but, me was beyond endurance. Then his Lordship arrived in England, brimming, with praise of you, to assure me that the affair was not about Patty at, all. This was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love, with her, and I may say now that I was miserable. Then, as we were, setting out for Castle Howard, came the news of your death on the road, to Upper Marlboro. I could not go a step. Poor Jack, he was very honest, when he proposed,\\\" she added, with a sigh.\\n\\nIt was Aunt Lucy who spent the morning with me, and Mrs. Manners brought, my dinner. I observed a questioning glance as she entered, which I took, for an attempt to read whether Mr. Marmaduke had spoke more than he, ought. But I would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my, discoveries, though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern., She stayed to talk on the progress of the war, relating the gallant, storming of Stony Point by Mad Anthony in July, and the latest Tory, insurrection on our own Eastern Shore. She passed from these matters to, a discussion of General Washington's new policy of the defensive, for, Mrs. Manners had always been at heart a patriot. And whilst I lay, listening with a deep interest, in comes my lady herself. So was it, ever, when you least expected her, even as Mammy had said. She curtseyed, very prettily, with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red, and asked me, how I did.\\n\\nRichard. You must have seen even then that I loved you, dear, though, I was so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his Grace. I could not, bear to think that you knew of any stain upon our family. I think--I, think I would rather have died, or have married him. That day I threw, Chartersea's presents out of the window, but my father made the servants, gather them all which escaped breaking, and put them in the drawing-room., Then I fell ill.\\\"\\n\\nAfter an hour of it, I was holding my breath against the lurches, like a, sea-sick man against that bottomless fall of the ship's bows on the, ocean. I had no pain,--only an over whelming exhaustion,--but the joy, of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy, dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary, twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning, ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic; or, reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of, that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous, of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort\\n\\nhis successful elusions of the 'Cerberus', which hounded him, and his, escape from the 'Solebay', are too famous to be dwelt upon here., Obtaining the Alfred, he captured and brought into Boston ten thousand, suits of uniform for Washington's shivering army. Then, by the bungling, of Congress, thirteen officers were promoted over his head. The, bitterness this act engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for, distinction was as great as Captain Jones's may be imagined. To his, everlasting credit be it recorded that he remained true to the country to, which he had dedicated his life and his talents. And it was not until, 1781 that he got the justice due him.\\n\\nWe had now but one of our starboard nine-pounders on its carriage, and, word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to, scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, we did, not have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away, for, the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy', from her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the, bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of, sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and, shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull\\n\\nTo us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay., Seven times, I say, was that battle lost, and seven times regained again., What was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their, posts through that hell of flame and shot, when a madman could scarce, have hoped for victory? What but the knowledge that somewhere in the, swirl above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept, all obstacles from before him, and into whose mind the thought of defeat, could not enter. His spirit held us to our task, for flesh and blood, might not have endured alone.\\n\\nand bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet, were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound, her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the, while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew, around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress, for the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her, muff and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs, of failure.\\n\\n\\\"I would never meet it, sir,\\\" he replied instantly. \\\"That would be the, height of folly. I would divide our forces into small, swift-sailing, squadrons, of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers. And I would, carry the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade. I can name, a score of such defenceless places, and I know every shoal of their, harbours. For example, Whitehaven might be entered. That is a town of, fifty thousand inhabitants. The fleet of merchantmen might with the, greatest ease be destroyed, a contribution levied, and Ireland's coal cut, off for a winter. The whole of the shipping might be swept out of the, Clyde. Newcastle is another likely place, and in almost any of the Irish, ports valuable vessels may be found. The Baltic and West Indian fleets, are to be intercepted. I have reflected upon these matters for years\\n\\nwhatever the pain they give. And my heart aches now when I think of that, dark day in Arlington Street when I gave you the locket, and you went out, of my life. I knew that I had done wrong then, Richard, as soon as ever, the door closed behind you. I should have gone with you, for better for, worse, for richer for poorer. I should have run after you in the rain, and thrown myself at your feet. And that would have been best for my, father and for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe Serapis, too, was now beginning to blaze aloft, and choking, wood-smoke eddied out of the Richard's hold and mingled with the powder, fumes. Then the enemy's fire abreast us seemed to lull, and Mr. Stacey, mounted the bulwarks, and cried out: \\\"You have cleared their decks, my, hearties!\\\" Aloft, a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the, very top of the Englishman, where he threw a hand-grenade, as I thought\\n\\nthat this was the man of whose innermost life I had had so intimate a, view. Who had taken me to the humble cottage under Criffel, who had, poured into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together, in the dingy room of the Castle Yard sponging-house. Then some of those, ludicrous scenes on the road to London came up to me, for which the, sky-blue frock was responsible. And yet this commodore was not greatly, removed from him I had first beheld on the brigantine John. His, confidence in his future had not so much as wavered since that day. That, future was now not so far distant as the horizon, and he was ready to, meet it.\\n\\nmerciful or cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act, of coolness and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a, gunner called for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch, the rammer from Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot, through his chest. Poor Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work, 'Scolding Sairy' was to do that night. I had but dragged him beyond, reach of the recoil when he was gone.\\n\\n\\\"To speak truth, I am heartily tired of that life,\\\" said he. \\\"There is, little glory in raising nicotia, and sipping bumbo, and cursing negroes., Ho for the sea!\\\" he cried. \\\"The salt sea, and the British prizes. Give, me a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake. Mark me, Richard,\\\" he, said, a restless gleam coning into his dark eyes, \\\"stirring times are, here, and a chance for all of us to make a name.\\\" For so it seemed ever, to be with him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I am speaking the truth,\\\" he said bitterly. \\\"And I assume no virtue, for the little justice it remains in my power to do. It is the lot of my, life that I must be false to some one always, and even now I am false to, your uncle. Yes, I am come to do justice, and 'tis a strange errand for, me. I know that estates have been restored to you by the Maryland, Legislature, Richard, and I believe in my heart that you will win this, war.\\\" Here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket. \\\"But to make you, secure,\\\" said he, \\\"in the year 1710, and on the 9th of March, old style\\n\\n\\\"I do not tell you that I shall change my life, Richard, for I have said, that too many times before. Indeed, I warn you that any money you may, send will be spent in drink, and--and worse. I will be no hypocrite to, you. But I believe that I am better this hour than I have been since, last I knelt at my mother's knee in the little Oxfordshire cottage where, I was born.\\\"\\n\\nDazed, I put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet. When I, had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for the very notion of, that cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in, his own temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that, panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the, ring-bolts of its companion that lay shattered there. \\\"Serve her with, double-headed, my lads,\\\" he shouted, \\\"and every shot into the, Englishman's mainmast!\\\"\\n\\nand set off at the devil's pace for the Texel. You must know that the, whole Dutch nation was in an uproar--as much of an uproar as those boors, ever reach--over the arrival of your infamous squadron. The Court Party, and our ambassador were for having you kicked out, and the Republicans, for making you at home. I heard that their High Mightinesses had given, Paul Jones the use of the Texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners\\n\\nNot until October of that year, 1775, was the infant navy born. Mr., Carvel was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical, seamanship and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of, instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon, the character of that hero by the fact that, with all his supreme, confidence in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first, lieutenancy. This was in deference to the older men before that body., \\\"I hoped,\\\" said he, \\\"in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from, those of more experience than myself.\\\" His lack of assertion for once, cost him dear. He sailed on the New Providence expedition under, Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon, discovered that, instead of gaining information, he was obliged to inform, others. He trained the men so thoroughly in the use of the great guns, \\\"that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as, soldiers generally perform the manual exercise.\\\"\\n\\nwhen I remembered the wilful miss who had come to London bent upon, pleasure alone. Truly, she was of that rare metal which refines, and, then outshines all others. And there was much I could not understand., A miracle had saved her from the Duke of Chartersea, but why she had, refused so many great men and good was beyond my comprehension. Not a, glimpse of her did I get that day, though my eyes wandered little from, the knob of the door. And even from Aunt Lucy no satisfaction was to be, had as to the cause of her absence.\\n\\n'Twas at this critical moment, when that fearful battle once more was, won, another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads, and that, name which we dreaded most of all was spread again. As we halted in, consternation, a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side, and, a babel of voices hailed the treacherous Landais with oaths and, imprecations. We made out the Alliance with a full head of canvas, black, and sharp, between us and the moon. Smoke hung above her rail. Getting, over against the signal fires blazing on Flamborough Head, she wore ship, and stood across our bows, the midshipman on the forecastle singing out, to her, by the commodore's orders, to lay the enemy by the board. There, was no response.\\n\\nI hurried over to the tea-cups, such a twinge did that discovery give me., But they troubled me near as much, and the sea-coal fire held strange, images. The fascination in the window was not to be denied, for it stood, in line with the houses and the trees. Suddenly there rose up before me, a gate. Yes, I knew that gate, and the girlish figure leaning over it., They were in Prince George Street. Behind them was a mass of golden-rose, bushes, and out of these came forth a black face under a turban, saying\\n\\n\\\"Ay, that he is, with our English cruisers thick as gulls outside', waiting for a dead fish. But he has spurned the French commission they, have offered him, saying that of the Congress is good enough for him., And he declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the, Alliance under the Stars and Stripes. And for this I honour him,\\\" added, he, \\\"and Charles honours him, and so must all Englishmen honour him when, they come to their senses. And by Gads life, I believe he will get, clear, for he is a marvel at seamanship.\\\"\\n\\nand worn themselves out with nursing me. Nor did I forget the risk they, ran with such a guest. For the first time in many years my heart, relented toward Mr. Marmaduke. For their sakes I forgave him over and, over what I had suffered, and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon, me. And how was I to repay them? They needed the money I had cost them\",\n          \", [This is the last letter which I was destined to receive from my poor, friend. He started to spend the Christmas of that year (1884) with his, people, and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident, at Sittingfleet, where the express ran into a freight train which was, standing in the depot. Dr. and Mrs. Munro were the only occupants of, the car next the locomotive, and were killed instantly, as were the, brakesman and one other passenger. It was such an end as both he and, his wife would have chosen; and no one who knew them would regret that, neither was left to mourn the other. His insurance policy of eleven, hundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own, family, which, as his father was sick, was the one worldly matter which, could have caused him concern.--H. S.]\\n\\nI told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious, return from Lochtully Castle. When I had settled for the flannel vests, which my mother had ordered so lavishly I had only five pounds left out, of my pay. With this, as it was the first money that I had ever earned, im{sic} my life, I bought her a gold bangle, so behold me reduced at, once to my usual empty pocketed condition. Well, it was something just, to feel that I HAD earned money. It gave me an assurance that I might, again.\\n\\nGood-bye, old chap, and never think that I forget you. Your letters are, read and re-read with avidity. I think I have every line you ever wrote, me. You simply knock Paley out every time. I am so glad that you got out, of that brewery business all right. For a time I was really afraid that, you must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares. I can, only thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques.\\n\\n\\\"A million pounds. Not a penny under. And dirt cheap to the nation that, buys it. I shall let it go at that, though I could make ten times as, much if I held on. I shall take it up to the Secretary of the Navy in, a week or two; and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person I, shall do business with him. It's not every day, Munro, that a man comes, into his office with the Atlantic under one arm and the Pacific under, the other. Eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nSince I am upon this topic, may I say just a little more without boring, you? You say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive, and that, I have nothing to offer in place of what I pull down. This is not quite, correct. I think that there are certain elemental truths within our, grasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance, and which are, sufficient to furnish us with a practical religion, having so much of, reason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold, not drive, them forth from it.\\n\\nfrom all I can learn of him, has suddenly swung clean over from one, extreme of character to the other. Every plus has in an instant become a, minus. He's another man, but in the same case. I am told that he used, to be (only a few months ago, mind you) most fastidious in dress, and speech. Now he is a foul-tongued rough! He had a nice taste in, literature. Now he stares at you if you speak of Shakespeare. Queerest, of all, he used to be a very high-and-dry Tory in his opinions. He, is fond now of airing the most democratic views, and in a needlessly, offensive way. When I did get on terms with him at last, I found that, there was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on, politics. In substance, I am bound to say that I think his new views are, probably saner than his old ones, but the insanity lies in his sudden, reasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech.\\n\\nYou know that you are turning up your nose at me, Bertie. I can see you, do it. But I'll come off the thin ice, and you shall have nothing but, facts now. I'm afraid that I should never do for a story-teller, for the, first stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me, off, with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me.\\n\\nYou'll laugh, Bertie, but it was no laughing matter to me. He wanted, eight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either, had or had not done. Otherwise the company would remove the gas-meter., How little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting, to me was either to pay away more than half my capital, or to give up, cooking my food! I at last appeased him by a promise that I should look, into the matter, and so escaped for the moment, badly shaken but still, solvent. He gave me a good deal of information about the state of his, tubes (his own, not the gas company's) before he departed; but I had, rather lost interest in the subject since I had learned that he was, being treated by his club doctor.\\n\\nWho do you think was the first person who broke this spell of, silence? The ruffian whom I had fought under the lamp-post. He is a, scissors-grinder it seems, and rang to know if I had a job for him. I, could not help grinning at him when I opened the door and saw who it, was. He showed no sign of recognising me, however, which is hardly to be, wondered at.\\n\\nthat years ago the name of Bradfield used to strike with a causeless, familiarity upon my ear; and since then, as you know, the course of my, life has flowed through it. And so when I first saw Winnie La Force in, the railway carriage, before I had spoken to her or knew her name, I, felt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her. Have you had, no experience of the sort in your life? Or was it merely that she was, obviously gentle and retiring, and so made a silent claim upon all that, was helpful and manly in me? At any rate, I was conscious of it; and, again and again every time that I met her. How good is that saying of, some Russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole, sex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand! I thought I, knew something of women. I suppose every medical student does. But now I, can see that I really knew nothing. My knowledge was all external. I did, not know the woman soul, that crowning gift of Providence to man, which\\n\\nshe runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a, household word, and they all pretend to sympathise with her, and, agree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man. I, quarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct, and it ended, by my throwing him down the stairs. What was the result? He talked so, much about it that the whole village from which he came, sick and, well, trooped to see me. The little country practitioner who had been, buttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well, put up his shutters. It's human nature, my boy, and you can't alter it., Eh, what? You make yourself cheap and you become cheap. You put a high, price on yourself and they rate you at that price. Suppose I set up in, Harley Street to-morrow, and made it all nice and easy, with hours from, ten to three, do you think I should get a patient? I might starve first., How would I work it? I should let it be known that I only saw patients, from midnight until two in the morning, and that bald-headed people, must pay double. That would set people talking, their curiosity would, be stimulated, and in four months the street would be blocked all night., Eh, what? laddie, you'd go yourself. That's my principle here. I often, come in of a morning and send them all about their business, tell them, I'm going off to the country for a day. I turn away forty pounds, and, it's worth four hundred as an advertisement!\\\"\\n\\nWell, this made me sit down and gasp. I am, I think, one of the most, unsuspicious men upon earth, and through a certain easy-going indolence, of disposition I never even think of the possibility of those with whom, I am brought in contact trying to deceive me. It does not occur to me., But let me once get on that line of thought--let me have proof that, there is reason for suspicion--and then all faith slips completely away, from me. Now I could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at, Bradfield. Those sudden fits of ill temper, the occasional ill-concealed, animosity of Cullingworth--did they not mark the arrival of each of, my mother's letters? I was convinced that they did. He had read them, then--read them from the pockets of the little house coat which I used, to leave carelessly in the hall when I put on my professional one to go, out. I could remember, for example, how at the end of his illness his, manner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my, mother's had arrived. Yes, it was certain that he had read them from the, beginning.\\n\\nThe time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this; but, we gradually whittled it down to five and to four. My income had risen, to about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time; and Winnie had, agreed, with a somewhat enigmatical smile, that we could manage very, well on that--the more so as marriage sends a doctor's income up. The, reason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that, date I received a most portentous blue document in which \\\"We, Brown, & Woodhouse, the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned, Winifred La Force, do hereby\\\"--state a surprising number of things\\n\\nNow about the Cullingworths. Madam is as amiable as ever; and yet, somehow, unless I am deceiving myself, she has changed somewhat of late, in her feelings towards me. I have turned upon her suddenly more than, once, and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than, malignant. In one or two small matters I have also detected a hardness, in her which I had never observed before. Is it that I have intruded, too much into their family life? Have I come between the husband and the, wife? Goodness knows I have striven with all my little stock of tact to, avoid doing so. And yet I have often felt that my position was a false, one. Perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a woman's, glances and gestures. He wishes to assign a definite meaning to each\\n\\nTo commence with what is of most moment, you may rest assured that what, you said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest, attention. I am sorry that I have not got it by me to refer to (I, lent it to Charlie), but I think I have the contents in my head. It is, notorious, as you say, that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of, the orthodox, and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to, dogma. Such men are the real enemies of free thought. If anything could, persuade me to turn traitor to my reason, it would, for example, be, the blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic, journals.\\n\\nI travelled down part of the way with young Leslie Duncan, whom I think, you know. He was gracious enough to consider that a third-class carriage, and my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude. You, know that he came into his uncle's money a little time ago, and after a, first delirious outbreak, he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state, of despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for., How absurd are the ambitions of life when I think that I, who am fairly, happy and as keen as a razor edge, should be struggling for that which, I can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him! And yet, if I, can read my own nature, it is not the accumulation of money which is my, real aim, but only that I may acquire so much as will relieve my mind, of sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which I may have\\n\\nwith the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character. Always, a lady, whether she was bargaining with the butcher, or breaking in a, skittish charwoman, or stirring the porridge, which I can see her doing, with the porridge-stick in one hand, and the other holding her Revue, des deux Mondes within two inches of her dear nose. That was always her, favourite reading, and I can never think of her without the association, of its browny-yellow cover.\\n\\nYou must know, then, that within the boundaries of this city there are, two ladies, a mother and a daughter, whom I shall call Mrs. and Miss, Laura Andrews. They are patients of the governor's, and have become, to some extent friends of the family. Madame is Welsh, charming, in appearance, dignified in her manners, and High Church in her, convictions. The daughter is rather taller than the mother, but, otherwise they are strikingly alike. The mother is thirty-six and, the daughter eighteen. Both are exceedingly charming. Had I to choose, between them, I think, entre nous, that the mother would have attracted, me most, for I am thoroughly of Balzac's opinion as to the woman of, thirty. However, fate was to will it otherwise.\\n\\nAfter all, I own to you, that it might have been better had I listened, to what he had to say, and refused to give my own views. On the other, hand, truth MUST be as broad as the universe which it is to explain, and, therefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive., A protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards, truth. Who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the Almighty? It would be, an insolence on the part of a solar system, and yet it is done every, day by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers. There lies the real, impiety.\\n\\nI read over what I have written, but I can see that I give you no real, insight into the demoniac cleverness of Cullingworth. His views upon, medicine were most revolutionary, but I daresay that if things fulfil, their promise I may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel., With his brilliant and unusual gifts, his fine athletic record, his, strange way of dressing (his hat on the back of his head and his throat, bare), his thundering voice, and his ugly, powerful face, he had quite, the most marked individuality of any man that I have ever known.\\n\\nI was compelled, by the way, to forego an opening which a few months ago, would have been the very summit of my ambition. You must know (possibly, I told you), that immediately after I passed, I put my name down as a, candidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship, lines. It was done as a forlorn hope, for a man has usually to wait, several years before his turn comes round. Well, just a week after I, started here, I got a telegram one night from Liverpool: \\\"Join the Decia, to-morrow as surgeon, not later than eight in the evening.\\\" It was from, Staunton & Merivale, the famous South American firm, and the Decia is, a fine 6000-ton passenger boat, doing the round journey by Bahia and, Buenos Ayres to Rio and Valparaiso. I had a bad quarter of an hour, I, can tell you. I don't think I was ever so undecided about anything in my, life. Cullingworth was dead against my going, and his influence carried, the day.\\n\\ntickled the child, and gained over the whole household. He had these, attacks periodically, and made an arrangement with me by which I was to, deal with him, and we were to balance bills against each other. It was, a ghoulish compact, by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to, me, while a spell of health for Haywood sent me back to dry bread and, saveloys. However, it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling, which must otherwise have gone in food. At last, however, the poor, fellow died, and there was our final settlement.\\n\\na selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her, attacks, insisting upon my carrying them away then and there; so that I, stagger out of the house like one of Napoleon's generals coming out of, Italy. There is a good deal of method in the old lady, however, and on, her recovery she invariably sends round a porter, with a polite note to, say that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again.\\n\\nthinking that it was an accident, but an instant afterwards I received, another and a harder one. I dropped my paper with a growl, but the, moment that I glanced at him I saw how the matter stood. His foot was, jerking spasmodically, his two hands clenched, and drumming against his, breast, while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his, iris was to be seen. I sprang upon him, tore open his collar, unbuttoned, his waistcoat, and pulled his head down upon the seat. Crash went one of, his heels through the carriage window, but I contrived to sit upon his, knees while I kept hold of his two wrists.\\n\\nWell, I was averse from going myself, but Winnie was all for peace and, forgiveness. Women who claim nothing invariably get everything, and so, my gentle little wife always carries her point. Half an hour later I was, in Cadogan Terrace with very mixed feelings, but the kindlier ones at, the top. I tried to think that Cullingworth's treatment of me had been, pathological--the result of a diseased brain. If a delirious man had, struck me, I should not have been angry with him. That must be my way of, looking at it.\\n\\n\\\"You may label me as you like,\\\" I answered (and by this time I fear that, I had got my preaching stop fairly out); \\\"I don't pretend to know what, truth is, for it is infinite, and I finite; but I know particularly well, what it is NOT. It is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen, hundred years ago, and that we are for ever to refer back to what was, written and said in those days. No, sir; religion is a vital living, thing, still growing and working, capable of endless extension and, development, like all other fields of thought. There were many eternal, truths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book, some parts, of which may indeed be called holy. But there are others yet to be, revealed; and if we are to reject them because they are not in those, pages, we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice, of Kirschoff's spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in, Albertus Magnus. A modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write, to the magazines; but none the less he may be the little pipe which, conveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth. Look at this!\\\" I, cried, rising and reading my Carlyle text. \\\"That comes from no Hebrew, prophet, but from a ratepayer in Chelsea. He and Emerson are also among, the prophets. The Almighty has not said His last say to the human race\\n\\nAnd first of all, a thousand thanks for your two long letters, which lie, before me as I write. There is little enough personal news in them, but, I can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels, off very smoothly from week to week. On the other hand, you give me, plenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more, interesting. After all, we may very well agree to differ. You think, some things are proved which I don't believe in. You think some things, edifying which do not appear to me to be so. Well, I know that you are, perfectly honest in your belief. I am sure you give me credit for being, the same. The future wilt decide which of us is right. The survival of, the truest is a constant law, I fancy, though it must be acknowledged, that it is very slow in action.\\n\\n\\\"Too provincial, my boy! What's the good of a village practice with, a miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to, spread? My head was sticking out at one end of Bradfield and my feet at, the other. Why, there wasn't room for Hetty in the place, let alone, me! I've taken to the eye, my boy. There's a fortune in the eye. A man, grudges a half-crown to cure his chest or his throat, but he'd spend his, last dollar over his eye. There's money in ears, but the eye is a gold, mine.\\\"\\n\\nshoved them against the wall, and occasionally rushed out to the head, of the stair to address them en masse. At the same time, behind all, this tomfoolery, I, watching his prescriptions, could see a quickness of, diagnosis, a scientific insight, and a daring and unconventional use of, drugs, which satisfied me that he was right in saying that, under all, this charlatanism, there lay solid reasons for his success. Indeed\\n\\nIt was some weeks, however, before I gained his confidence, so far as, to be able to hold a real conversation with him. For a long time he was, very sullen and suspicious, resenting the constant watch which I kept, upon him. This could not be relaxed, for he was full of the most apish, tricks. One day he got hold of my tobacco pouch, and stuffed two ounces, of my tobacco into the long barrel of an Eastern gun which hangs on the, wall. He jammed it all down with the ramrod, and I was never able to get, it up again. Another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the, window, and would have sent the clock after it had I not prevented, him. Every day I took him for a two hours' constitutional, save when it, rained, and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down, the room. Heh! but it was a deadly, dreary, kind of life.\\n\\nThis took some thinking out. It had an ugly sound, but I gathered that, she meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since, these gentlemen were satisfied. So the bargain was struck, and I ordered, tea to be ready in an hour, while I went back to the station to fetch up, my luggage. A porter brought it up for eightpence (saving fourpence on, a cab, my boy!) and so I found myself in the heart of Birchespool with, a base of operations secured. I looked out of the little window of my, lodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs, with a spire or, two spurting up among them, and I shook my teaspoon defiantly at them., \\\"You've got to conquer me,\\\" said I, \\\"or else I'm man enough to conquer, you.\\\"\\n\\nSo, after much argument, it ended in the kind fellow going off and, leaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table. The money, burned my fingers, for I knew that his pension was not a very large one;, and yet, since I could not avoid taking it, there was no denying that it, was exceedingly useful. Out I sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it, upon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my, bed. Already, you see, I was getting to a state of enervating luxury, in my household arrangements, and I could only lull my conscience by, reminding myself that little Paul would have to sleep with me when he, came.\\n\\nor else may be taken as marking the tombs of Anglican chiefs, the, lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping. This had been explained, by the Patagonian school as being a universal system of, lightning-conductors. He (the lecturer) could not assent to this theory., In a series of observations, extending over several months, he had, discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing, if followed, out, invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were, connected with furnaces. No one who knew how addicted the ancient, Britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant., Evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central, chamber, and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the, tubes to the house of every citizen, so that he might inhale it at will., Having illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams, the lecturer, concluded by saying that, although true science was invariably cautious, and undogmatic, it was none the less an incontestable fact that so, much light had been thrown upon old London, that every action of the, citizens' daily life was known, from the taking of a tub in the morning\\n\\nnow that I come to think of it, I have never enjoyed very much of your, confidence in return. But that may be my fault. Perhaps you don't find, me sympathetic, even though I have every wish to be. I can only say that, I find you intensely so, and perhaps I presume too much upon the fact., But no, every instinct in my nature tells me that I don't bore you by my, confidences.\\n\\nAnd all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news. It is, that I had a telegram from Cullingworth this morning--after nine months', silence. It was dated from Avonmouth, the town where I had suspected, that he had settled, and it said simply, \\\"Come at once. I have urgent, need of you. CULLINGWORTH.\\\" Of course, I shall go by the first train, to-morrow. It may mean anything or nothing. In my heart of hearts I hope, and believe that old Cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his, partner or in some other way. I always believed that he would turn up, trumps, and make my fortune as well as his own. He knows that if I am, not very quick or brilliant I am fairly steady and reliable. So that's, what I've been working up to all along, Bertie, that to-morrow I go to, join Cullingworth, and that it looks as if there was to be an opening, for me at last. I gave you a sketch of him and his ways, so that you may, take an interest in the development of my fortune, which you could not, do if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand, to me.\\n\\n, Do you think that such a thing as chance exists? Rather an explosive, sentence to start a letter with; but pray cast your mind back over your, own life, and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of, chance. You know how often the turning down this street or that, the, accepting or rejecting of an invitation, may deflect the whole current, of our lives into some other channel. Are we mere leaves, fluttered, hither and thither by the wind, or are we rather, with every conviction, that we are free agents, carried steadily along to a definite and, pre-determined end? I confess that as I advance through life, I become, more and more confirmed in that fatalism to which I have always had an, inclination.\\n\\nWell, I made the most dreadful fool of myself. At first, the good lady, who (as I think I told you) is very dignified and rather reserved, could, not believe her senses. Then, as the full force of my enormity came upon, her she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest, woman I had ever seen. It was an interview with a refrigerator. She, asked me what I had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged, me to subject her to such an outrage. I saw, of course, that any excuses, upon my part would put her on the right track and give poor Laura away;, so I stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand, presenting\\n\\nand two layers of them squatting in the cellar? Well, that's my house of, business on an average day. The folk come in from the county fifty miles, off, and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep, so as to be first in, when the housekeeper comes down. The medical officer of health made an, official complaint of the over-crowding of my waiting-rooms. They wait, in the stables, and sit along the racks and under the horses' bellies., I'll turn some of 'em on to you, my boy, and then you'll know a little, more about it.\\\"\\n\\nI walked down to the Park, which is the chief centre of the place, and I, found that I liked everything I saw of it. It was a lovely evening, and, the air was fresh and sweet. I sat down and listened to the band for an, hour, watching all the family parties, and feeling particularly lonely., Music nearly always puts me into the minor key; so there came a time, when I could stand it no longer, and I set off to find my way back to my, lodgings. On the whole, I felt that Birchespool was a place in which a, man might very well spend a happy life.\\n\\n\\\"The best dispenser in the world!\\\" cried Cullingworth, patting her on, the shoulder. \\\"You see how I do it, Munro. I write on a label what the, prescription is, and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged., The man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon, hole. Hetty makes it up, passes out the bottle, and takes the money., Now, come on and clear some of these folk out of the house.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Williams and I stood for five minutes without a word, hushed by the, presence of that supreme fact. Then we laid him straight, and drew the, sheet over him. She knelt down and prayed and sobbed, while I sat on, the bed, with the cold hand in mine. Then my heart turned to lead as I, remembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the, moral principles of right and wrong. But when you look closely it is a, question whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not, prove to have been a right to the interests of posterity. That sounds, a little foggy; but I will make my meaning more clear when I say that, I think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those, great hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe, that both, are making for improvement; but that the action of the one is immediate\\n\\nso they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks. They have the, most singular notions about medicines. \\\"It's that strong that a spoon, will stand oop in't!\\\" is one man's description. Above all, they love to, have two bottles, one with a solution of citric acid, and the other with, carbonate of soda. When the mixture begins to fizz, they realise that, there is indeed a science of medicine.\\n\\n\\\"Deuced interesting thing, Munro,\\\" said he. \\\"Come and look at this, temperature chart. I've been taking it every quarter of an hour since I, couldn't sleep, and it's up and down till it looks like the mountains in, the geography books. We'll have some drugs in--eh, what, Munro?--and by, Crums, we'll revolutionise all their ideas about fevers. I'll write a, pamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean, out of date, and they'll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And there is one more thing, Mr. Detective, sir,\\\" said Whitehall, explosively. \\\"I'm not a rich man, sir, only the ---- half-pay skipper, of an armed transport; but by ----, sir, I'd give you this hat full of, dollars to know the name of the ---- rascal who wrote that anonymous, letter, sir. By ---- sir, you'd have a real case to look after then.\\\", And he waved his black thorn ferociously.\\n\\nWell, I sat down there and brooded. In my heart I did not believe that, Cullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease. That could not, have been his real reason for driving me from the practice. He had found, me in the way in his domestic life, no doubt, and he had devised, this excuse for getting rid of me. Whatever the reason was, it was, sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice\\n\\ninto forced smiles when I had asked him point blank what was the matter?, One obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without, telling also how he had acquired his information. But I knew enough of, Cullingworth's resource to feel that he could easily have got over such, a difficulty as that. In fact, in this last letter he HAD got over it, by his tale about the grate and the maid. He must have had some stronger, reason for restraint. As I thought over the course of our relations I, was convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until I had, committed myself, and then to abandon me, so that I should myself have, no resource but to compound with my creditors-to be, in fact, that which, my mother had called him.\\n\\nWisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme, of Nature. What proof do we want, then, from a book? If the man who, observes the myriad stars, and considers that they and their innumerable, satellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens, each, swinging clear of the other's orbit--if, I say, the man who sees this, cannot realise the Creator's attributes without the help of the book of, Job, then his view of things is beyond my understanding. Nor is it only, in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some, intelligent force. Nothing is too tiny for that fostering care. We see, the minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the, calyx of the flower, the most microscopic hair and gland each with its, definite purposeful function to perform. What matter whether these came, by special creation or by evolution? We know as a matter of fact that, they came by evolution, but that only defines the law. It does not, explain it.\\n\\nWell, we all work back again by two o'clock, when we find dinner waiting, for us. We may or may not have finished our rounds. If not away we go, again. If we have, Horton dictates his prescriptions, and strides off, to bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth. He is the most abandoned, smoker I have ever met with, collecting the dottles of his pipes in, the evening, and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the, stable yard. When he has departed for his nap, McCarthy and I get to, work on the medicine. There are, perhaps, fifty bottles to put up, with, pills, ointment, etc. It is quite half-past four before we have them all, laid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids. Then we have, an hour or so of quiet, when we smoke or read, or box with the coachman, in the harness room. After tea the evening's work commences. From six to, nine people are coming in for their medicine, or fresh patients wishing, advice. When these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases, which may be on the list; and so, about ten o'clock, we may hope to have, another smoke, and perhaps a game of cards. Then it is a rare thing for, a night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a, case which may take us two hours, or may take us ten. Hard work, as you, see; but Horton is such a good chap, and works so hard himself, that one, does not mind what one does. And then we are all like brothers in the, house; our talk is just a rattle of chaff, and the patients are as, homely as ourselves, so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of, us.\\n\\nBut we were demoralised by luxury. We could no longer manage without a, helper--especially now in the winter time, when fires had to be lit--the, most heart-breaking task that a man can undertake. I bethought me of, the quiet Miss Williams, and hunted her up in her shop. She was quite, willing to come, and saw how she could get out of the rent; but the, difficulty lay with her stock. This sounded formidable at first, but, when I came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings, it, did not appear insurmountable. In half an hour my watch was pawned, and, the affair concluded. I returned with an excellent housekeeper, and, with a larger basketful of inferior Swedish matches, bootlaces, cakes of, black lead, and little figures made of sugar than I should have thought, it possible to get for the money. So now we have settled down, and I, hope that a period of comparative peace lies before us.\\n\\nI nearly snatched it out of his hands. Then away I ran to take, possession of my property. Never shall I forget my feelings, my dear, Bertie, when the key clicked in the lock, and the door flew open. It was, my own house--all my very own! I shut the door again, the noise of the, street died down, and I had, in that empty, dust-strewn hall, such a, sense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before. In all my life, it was the first time that I had ever stood upon boards which were not, paid for by another.\\n\\nAnd then as I walked back I considered how far I could avail myself of, this money from Cullingworth. It was not much, but it would be madness, to start without it, for I had sent home the little which I had saved at, Horton's. I had not more than six pounds in the whole world. I reflected, that the money could make no difference to Cullingworth, with his large, income, while it made a vast one to me. I should repay him in a year, or two at the latest. Perhaps I might get on so well as to be able to, dispense with it almost at once. There could be no doubt that it was the, representations of Cullingworth as to my future prospects in Bradfield, which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the Decia. I need, not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance, from his hands. On my return, I told him that I had decided to do so\\n\\nWhen the auction was over, I paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on, to a trolly, the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings., I found that I had over-estimated the cost of furnishing, for the total, expense was little more than three pounds. We walked round to Oakley, Villa, and I proudly deposited all my goods in the hall. And here came, another extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes. The, porter when I had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a, huge mat of oakum, as ugly a thing as I have ever set eyes upon. This he, laid down inside my door, and then without a word, brushing aside every, remonstrance or attempt at thanks, he vanished away with his trolly into, the night.\\n\\nfor a short spell I could manage to live on a couple of pence a day; but, what I am doing now is not to be a mere spurt, but my regular mode of, life for many a month to come. My tea and sugar and milk (Swiss), come collectively to one penny a day. The loaf is at twopence, three-farthings, and I consume one a day. My dinner consists in, rotation of one third of a pound of bacon, cooked over the gas (twopence, halfpenny), or two saveloys (twopence), or two pieces of fried, fish (twopence), or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of Chicago beef, (twopence). Any one of these, with a due allowance of bread and water\\n\\nBut once inside, there was so much to be done that I did not know what, I should turn to first. I bought a one-and-ninepenny broom and set to, work. You notice that I am precise about small sums, because just there, lies the whole key of the situation. In the yard I found a zinc pail, with a hole in it, which was most useful, for by its aid I managed to, carry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped. Then with my new, broom, my coat hung on a gas-bracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the, elbow, I cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall, brushing the refuse, into the yard. After that I did as much for the upper floor, with the, result that I brought several square yards of dust down into the hall, again, and undid my previous cleaning. This was disheartening, but at, least it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future. When I had, finished, I was as hot and dirty as if it were half-time at a football, match. I thought of our tidy charwoman at home, and realised what, splendid training she must be in.\\n\\nHis mind runs rather on naval architecture at present, and he has been, devising an ingenious method of preventing wooden-sided vessels from, being crippled by artillery fire. I did not think much of his magnetic, attractor, because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success, that he claimed for it, it would merely have the effect of substituting, some other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells. This new, project has, however, more to recommend it. This is the idea, as put in, his own words; and, as he has been speaking of little else for the last, two days, I ought to remember them.\\n\\nwhen we think of the more advanced type of young man, we picture him as, bald, and with double eye-glasses. I am an absolute animal myself, and, my only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going. On the, other hand, there is some evidence in favour of the development of a, sixth sense-that of perception. If I had it now I should know that you, are heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism.\\n\\nI confess that I have never been able to understand the position of the, atheist. In fact, I have come to disbelieve in his existence, and, to look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach. It may, represent a temporary condition, a passing mental phase, a defiant, reaction against an anthropomorphic ideal; but I cannot conceive that, any man can continue to survey Nature and to deny that there are laws at, work which display intelligence and power. The very existence of a world, carries with it the proof of a world-maker, as the table guarantees, the pre-existence of the carpenter. Granting this, one may form what, conception one will of that Maker, but one cannot be an atheist.\\n\\nwhich should keep parallel with his medical one, were for ever at an, end. On the whole, bearing in mind my mother's opposition, and the, continual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks, I was, not very sorry. On the contrary, a sudden curious little thrill of, happiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff, and, as a, drift of rooks passed cawing over my head, I began cawing also in the, overflow of my spirits.\\n\\nThe unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased, to deserve the name. You remember that in my last I had received my, dismissal, and was on the eve of starting for the little country town, of Stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there., Well, in the morning, before I came down to breakfast, I was putting one, or two things into a bag, when there came a timid knock at my door, and, there was Mrs. Cullingworth in her dressing-jacket, with her hair down, her back.\\n\\n\\\"You'll forgive me for saying, Dr. Munro, sir, that you are a ---- lucky, fellow,\\\" said he. \\\"You've put your hand in the bag, sir, and taken out, the eel first time, as any one with half an eye can see. Now, I've had, three dips, and landed a snake every dip. If I'd had a good woman at my, side, Dr. Munro, sir, I might not be the broken half-pay skipper of an, armed transport to-day.\\\"\\n\\nFred was a little better during the day, and even seemed in a dull, sort of way to recognise his sister, who brought him flowers in the, afternoon. Towards evening his temperature sank to 101.5@, and he, fell into a kind of stupor. As it happened, Dr. Porter came in about, supper-time, and I asked him if he would step up and have a look at my, patient. He did so, and we found him dozing peacefully. You would hardly, think that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous, in my life. It was the merest chance in the world that Porter went up at, all.\\n\\nthe coachman, Mrs. Cullingworth, and the coachman's wife. We dug, foundations, got bricks in by the cartload, made our own mortar, and I, think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it. It's not quite, as flat-chested as we could wish; and I think that if I were a horse, inside it, I should be careful about brushing against the walls;, but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished., Cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves; but as, we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing, need.\\n\\nOf course, I told him that his views were diabolical; but, especially, since that warning which I had from his wife, I discount everything, that he says. He begins in earnest; but as he goes on the humour of, exaggeration gets hold of him, and he winds up with things which he, would never uphold in cold blood. However, the fact remains that we, differ widely in our views of professional life, and I fear that we may, come to grief over the question.\\n\\nWell, there the matter might have ended; but about three days afterwards, who should be shown into my consulting room but Mrs. La Force and her, daughter. I thought the latter looked twice at me, when her mother, introduced her, as if she had some recollection of my face; but she, evidently could not recall where she had seen it, and I said nothing to, help her. They both seemed to be much distressed in mind--indeed\\n\\nInstead of \\\"pulling himself together,\\\" he very nearly knocked me, asunder. I was all abroad for an instant. He had turned on me like a, flash, and had struck me on the throat just under the chin, my head, being a little back at the moment. It made me swallow once or twice, I, can tell you. Sudden as the blow was, I had countered, in the automatic, sort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does. It was only, from the elbow, with no body behind it, but it served to stave him off, for the moment, while I was making inquiries about my windpipe. Then, in he came with a rush; and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of, delight, we were pushed, almost locked in each other's arms on to that, big pedestal of which I have spoken. \\\"Go it, little 'un!\\\" \\\"Give him, beans!\\\" yelled the mob, who had lost all sight of the origin of the, fray, and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter, man. So there, my dear Bertie, was I, within a few hours of my entrance, into this town, with my top-hat down to my ears, my highly professional, frock-coat, and my kid gloves, fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal, in one of the most public places, in the heart of a yelling and hostile, mob! I ask you whether that was cruel luck or not?\\n\\nas far as I have ever been able to observe it, has been that it allows, the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other, men could only reach by hard work. In this sense Cullingworth was the, greatest genius that I have ever known. He never seemed to work, and yet, he took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the ten-hour-a-day, men. That might not count for much, for he was quite capable of idling, ostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night; but, start a subject of your own for him, and then see his originality and, strength. Talk about torpedoes, and he would catch up a pencil, and on, the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some, novel contrivance for piercing a ship's netting and getting at her side\\n\\nI remember how struck I was when first I saw the actual cautery applied, in a case of spinal disease. The white hot iron was pressed firmly into, the patient's back, without the use of any anaesthetic, and what with, the sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh I felt faint and ill., Yet, to my astonishment, the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle, of his face, and on my inquiring afterwards, he assured me that the, proceeding was absolutely painless, a remark which was corroborated, by the surgeon. \\\"The nerves are so completely and instantaneously, destroyed,\\\" he explained, \\\"that they have no time to convey a painful, impression.\\\" But then if this be so, what becomes of all the martyrs, at the stake, and the victims of Red Indians, and other poor folk, over whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered? It may be that, Providence is not only not cruel itself, but will not allow man to be, cruel either. Do your worst, and it will step in with a \\\"No, I won't, allow this poor child of mine to be hurt\\\"; and then comes the dulling, of the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of, the tormentor. David Livingstone under the claws of the lion must have, looked like an object lesson of the evil side of things, and yet he has, left it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than, otherwise. I am well convinced that if the newly-born infant and the man, who had just died could compare their experiences, the former would have, proved to be the sufferer. It is not for nothing that the first thing, the newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and, protest energetically against fate.\\n\\nPerhaps it was too bad of me to say that. I might have guarded without, countering. Anyhow; it had the effect of ending an interview which was, becoming oppressive. My visitor was too indignant to answer, and swept, out of the room without a word. From my window I could see him hurry, down the street, a little black angry thing, very hot and troubled, because he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and, compasses.\\n\\nI face my study window as I write, Bertie. Slate-coloured clouds with, ragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead. Between them one has a, glimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray. I can hear the gentle swish, of the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller, among the leaves. Sometimes it falls straight and heavy, till the air is, full of the delicate gray shading, and for half a foot above the ground, there is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules. Then, without any change in the clouds it cases off again. Pools line my walk\\n\\nso I climbed out of bed, gathered a little heap of tobacco-dust from the, linings of my pocket, and smoked the whole thing over. That life-belt of, which I had spoken so confidingly had burst, and left me to kick as best, I might in very deep water. I read the note over and over again; and for, all my dilemma, I could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and, stupidity of the thing. The picture of the host and hostess busying, themselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest, struck me as one of the funniest things I could remember. And there, was the stupidity of it, because surely a child could have seen that my, mother's attack was in answer to my defence. Why should we write a duet, each saying the same thing? Well, I'm still very confused about it all\\n\\nand I knew that her mother's will was her law, and that her course, was already marked out for her. However, we exchanged our little, confidences, and met occasionally by appointment, and tried to make our, lives brighter without darkening those of any one else. I can see you, shake your head here and growl, like the comfortable married man that, you are, that such relations are very dangerous. So they are, my boy:, but neither of us cared, she out of innocence and I out of recklessness\\n\\n\\\"Your letter to hand. Why not call me a liar at once? I tell you that I, have seen thirty thousand patients in the last year. My actual takings, have been over four thousand pounds. All patients come to me. Would not, cross the street to see Queen Victoria. You can have all visiting, all, surgery, all midwifery. Make what you like of it. Will guarantee three, hundred pounds the first year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may knock,\\\" said he, when I began to percuss his chest, \\\"but I am, ---- sure there's no one at home. They've all gone visiting one another., Sir John Hutton had a try some years ago. 'Why, dammy, man, where's your, liver?' said he. 'Seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a, porridge stick,' said he. 'Nothing is in its right place.' 'Except, my heart, Sir John,' said I. 'Aye, by ----, that will never lose its, moorings while it has a flap left.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I have written to you about my practice, and I've wired to you, about it, and here you sit asking me if I work it in two rooms. I'll, have to hire the market square before I've finished, and then I won't, have space to wag my elbows. Can your imagination rise to a great house, with people waiting in every room, jammed in as tight as they'll fit\\n\\nWell, it ended by lord and lacquey moving off, and leaving me with my, patient. I thought that I should lose no time in establishing a kindly, relation with him, so I drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask, him a few questions about his health and habits. Not a word could I get, out of him in reply. He sat as sullen as a mule, with a kind of sneer, about his handsome face, which showed me very well that he had heard, everything. I tried this and tried that, but not a syllable could I, get from him; so at last I turned from him and began to look over some, illustrated papers on the table. He doesn't read, it seems, and will do, nothing but look at pictures. Well, I was sitting like this with my back, half turned, when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking, gently at me, and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into, my coat pocket. I caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round, but too, late to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind, the Hon. James Derwent, who sat grinning at me like a mischievous, monkey.\\n\\nif we do not ourselves degrade it, will set an edge to all that is good, in us. I did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a man's whole, life and every action with unselfishness. I did not know how easy it is, to be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be, so; or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes, instead of two. I had much to learn, you see; but I think I have learned, it.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Munro\\\" (this was the style of the thing), \\\"why was armour, abandoned, eh? What! I'll tell you why. It was because the weight of, metal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he, could carry. But battles are not fought now-a-days by men who are, standing up. Your infantry are all lying on their stomachs, and it would, take very little to protect them. And steel has improved, Munro! Chilled, steel! Bessemer! Bessemer! Very good. How much to cover a man? Fourteen, inches by twelve, meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance., A notch at one side for the rifle. There you have it, laddie--the, Cullingworth patent portable bullet-proof shield! Weight? Oh, the weight, would be sixteen pounds. I worked it out. Each company carries its, shields in go-carts, and they are served out on going into action. Give, me twenty thousand good shots, and I'll go in at Calais and come out at, Pekin. Think of it, my boy! the moral effect. One side gets home every, time and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates. No, troops would stand it. The nation that gets it first will pitchfork the, rest of Europe over the edge. They're bound to have it--all of them., Let's reckon it out. There's about eight million of them on a war, footing. Let us suppose that only half of them have it. I say only half\\n\\nWe are at one, he and I, in thinking that the infinite is beyond our, perception. We differ only in that he sees evil and I see good in the, working of the universe. Ah, what a mystery it all is! Let us be honest, and humble and think kindly of each other. There's a line of stars all, winking at me over the opposite roof--winking slyly at the silly little, person with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never, understand.\\n\\nWe came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd, waiting for our chance. Presently up went a very neat little table. I, gave a nod and got it for nine shillings. Then three rather striking, looking chairs, black wood and cane bottoms. Four shillings each I gave, for those. Then a metal umbrella-stand, four and sixpence. That was a, mere luxury, but I was warming to the work. A job lot of curtains all, tied together in a bundle went up. Somebody bid five shillings. The, auctioneer's eye came round to me, and I nodded. Mine again for five, and sixpence. Then I bought a square of red drugget for half-a-crown\\n\\nThen I pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which I had, from the first determined upon as my bedchamber. I found an old packing, case in the yard--a relic of my predecessor's removal--and this made a, very good wash-hand stand for my basin and jug. When it was all fixed up, I walked, swelling with pride, through my own chambers, giving a touch, here and a touch there until I had it perfect. I wish my mother could, see it--or, on second thoughts, I don't; for I know that her first act, would be to prepare gallons of hot water, and to holystone the whole, place down, from garret to cellar--and I know by my own small experience, what that means.\\n\\nThere, now, you see what comes of waving the red rag! Let me make, a concession to appease you. I do believe that Christianity in its, different forms has been the very best thing for the world during all, this long barbarous epoch. Of course, it has been the best thing, else, Providence would not have permitted it. The engineer knows best what, tools to use in strengthening his own machine. But when you say that, this is the best and last tool which will be used, you are laying down, the law a little too much.\\n\\nthough open to attacks of romance. I can recollect her coming to see me, at a junction through which my train passed, with a six months' absence, on either side of the incident. We had five minutes' conversation, my, head out of the carriage window. \\\"Wear flannel next your skin, my dear, boy, and never believe in eternal punishment,\\\" was her last item of, advice as we rolled out of the station. Then to finish her portrait, I need not tell you, who have seen her, that she is young-looking and, comely to be the mother of about thirty-five feet of humanity. She, was in the railway carriage and I on the platform the other day. \\\"Your, husband had better get in or we'll go without him,\\\" said the guard. As, we went off, the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket, and I know, that she was looking for a shilling.\\n\\nI may be doing you an injustice, Bertie, but it seemed to me in, your last that there were indications that the free expression of my, religious views had been distasteful to you. That you should disagree, with me I am prepared for; but that you should object to free and honest, discussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest, over, would, I confess, be a disappointment. The Freethinker is placed, at this disadvantage in ordinary society, that whereas it would be, considered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox, opinion, no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees., There was a time when it took a brave man to be a Christian. Now it, takes a brave man not to be. But if we are to wear a gag, and hide our, thoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimate----no, but I, won't believe it. You and I have put up too many thoughts together and, chased them where-ever{sic} they would double, Bertie; so just write to, me like a good fellow, and tell me that I am an ass. Until I have that, comforting assurance, I shall place a quarantine upon everything which, could conceivably be offensive to you.\\n\\nAnd so the matter blew over; but I very much fear, Bertie, that this is, the first row of a series. I have a presentiment that sooner or later my, position here will become untenable. Still, I shall give it a fair trial, as long as he will let me. Cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have, nothing but inferiors and dependants round him. Now, I like to stand on, my own legs, and think with my own mind. If he'll let me do this we'll, get along very well; but if I know the man he will claim submission\\n\\nwhite-haired, old Roman Catholic priest, who had sat quietly reading his, office in the corner. We fell into the most intimate talk, which lasted, all the way to Avonmouth--indeed, so interested was I that I very nearly, passed through the place without knowing it. Father Logan (for that was, his name) seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should, be--self-sacrificing and pure-minded, with a kind of simple cunning, about him, and a deal of innocent fun. He had the defects as well as the, virtues of his class, for he was absolutely reactionary in his views., We discussed religion with fervour, and his theology was somewhere, about the Early Pliocene. He might have chattered the matter over with, a priest of Charlemagne's Court, and they would have shaken hands after, every sentence. He would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit., It was consistency in his eyes. If our astronomers and inventors and, law-givers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation, be? Is religion the only domain of thought which is non-progressive, and, to be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago?, Can they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider, outlook? A half-formed brain makes a half-formed God, and who shall say, that our brains are even half-formed yet? The truly inspired priest is, the man or woman with the big brain. It is not the shaven patch on the, outside, but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of, election.\\n\\nMind, my dear Bertie, I do not wish to run down your view or that of any, other man. We who claim toleration should be the first to extend it, to others. I am only indicating my own position, as I have often done, before. And I know your reply so well. Can't I hear your grave voice, saying \\\"Have faith!\\\" Your conscience allows you to. Well, mine won't, allow me. I see so clearly that faith is not a virtue, but a vice. It is, a goat which has been herded with the sheep. If a man deliberately shut, his physical eyes and refused to use them, you would be as quick as any, one in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to Nature. And yet you, would counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift, the reason, and, to refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life.\\n\\nCullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as, I had advised, and that he would let me know the result in a few days., Mrs. C. would hardly shake hands with me when I said goodbye; but I like, her the better for that. He must have a great deal of good in him, or he, could not have won her love and confidence so completely. Perhaps there, is another Cullingworth behind the scenes--a softer, tenderer man, who, can love and invite love. If there is, I have never got near him. And, yet I may only have been tapping at the shell. Who knows? For that, matter, it is likely enough that he has never got at the real Johnnie, Munro. But you have, Bertie; and I think that you've had a little too, much of him this time, only you encourage me to this sort of excess by, your sympathetic replies. Well, I've done as much as the General Post, Office will carry for fivepence, so I'll conclude by merely remarking, that a fortnight has passed, and that I have had no news from Avonmouth\\n\\nI often have my doubts, Bertie, if there is such a thing as the, existence of evil? If we could honestly convince ourselves that there, was not, it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion., But don't let us strain truth even for such an object as that. I must, confess that there are some forms of vice, cruelty for example, for, which it is hard to find any explanation, save indeed that it is a, degenerate survival of that war-like ferocity which may once have been, of service in helping to protect the community. No; let me be frank, and, say that I can't make cruelty fit into my scheme. But when you find that, other evils, which seem at first sight black enough, really tend in, the long run to the good of mankind, it may be hoped that those which, continue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some, fashion which is now inexplicable.\\n\\nI left my baggage at the office, and jumped into a tramcar which was, passing the station, with the intention of looking for lodgings, as, I judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel. The conductor, interested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think, that the poorer classes in England are one of the kindliest races on, earth. Policemen, postmen, railway guards, busmen, what good helpful, fellows they all are! This one reckoned the whole thing out, how this, street was central but dear, and the other was out-of-the-way but cheap\\n\\n\\\"I am quite convinced that what you say is true,\\\" he answered; \\\"but Lady, Saltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas, into him. You know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason, with a lady. However, I have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if, you would see Lady Saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood, your views upon this point, and that you are personally a supporter of a, Hereditary Chamber.\\\"\\n\\nWith all respect to you, Bertie, it is very easy to be orthodox. A man, who wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would, certainly choose to be so. As Smiles says--\\\"A dead fish can float with, the stream, but it takes a man to swim against it.\\\" What could be more, noble than the start and the starter of Christianity? How beautiful, the upward struggle of an idea, like some sweet flower blossoming out, amongst rubble and cinders! But, alas! to say that this idea was a final, idea! That this scheme of thought was above the reason! That this, gentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even, imagine a personality without irreverence!--all this will come to rank, with the strangest delusions of mankind. And then how clouded has become, that fine daybreak of Christianity! Its representatives have risen from, the manger to the palace, from the fishing smack to the House of Lords., Nor is that other old potentate in the Vatican, with his art treasures\\n\\nAfter all, true science must be synonymous with religion, since science, is the acquirement of fact; and facts are all that we have from which to, deduce what we are and why we are here. But surely the more we pry into, the methods by which results are brougt{sic} about, the more stupendous, and wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind, the, power which drifts the solar system in safety through space, and, yet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the, honey-bearing flower. What is that central intelligence? You may fit, up your dogmatic scientist with a 300-diameter microscope, and with a, telescope with a six-foot speculum, but neither near nor far can he get, a trace of that great driving power.\\n\\n\\\"they are in a sense relations of yours. You are very closely allied to, the Percies, and the Saltires have Percy blood in them also. They are, only a cadet branch, and you are close upon the main line; but still it, is not for us to deny the connection.\\\" She brought a cold sweat out upon, me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to Lord, Saltire and explaining our respective positions. Several times during, the evening I heard her murmur complacently that they were only the, cadet branch.\\n\\nCullingworth and his wife. They visit nobody, and nobody visits them. My, living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my, head, although I have never done anything unprofessional myself. Who, should I see in the street the other day but the McFarlanes, whom you, will remember at Linlithgow? I was foolish enough to propose to Maimie, McFarlane once, and she was sensible enough to refuse me. What I should, have done had she accepted me, I can't imagine; for that was three years, ago, and I have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then., Well, there's no use yearning for what you can't have, and there's no, other man living to whom I would speak about the matter at all; but life, is a deadly, lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself., Why is it that I am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you\\n\\nI was, as you may imagine, all in a tingle to know what it was that he, wanted with me. However, as he made no allusion to it, I did not care to, ask, and, during our longish walk, we talked about indifferent matters., It was football first, I remember, whether Richmond had a chance against, Blackheath, and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the, old scrimmages. Then he got on to inventions, and became so excited that, he had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all, his points home with his fist upon his palm. I can see him now stopping\\n\\nbut a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth. One, feels that the white upon the hair, like that upon the mountain, should, signify a height attained. I rose and bade him good-night, with a last, impression of him leaning back in his dressing-gown, a sodden cigar-end, in the corner of his mouth, his beard all slopped with whisky, and his, half-glazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr. I, had to go into the street and walk up and down for half-an-hour before I, felt clean enough to go to bed.\\n\\nAt three in the morning, I was awakened by a dreadful crash. Bounding, out of bed I rushed into the other room. Poor Fred was standing in his, long gown, a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning, day. He had pulled over his washing-stand (with what object only his, bemuddled mind could say), and the whole place was a morass of water, with islands of broken crockery. I picked him up and put him back into, his bed again--his body glowing through his night-dress, and his eyes, staring wildly about him. It was evidently impossible to leave him, and, so I spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair., No, it was certainly not a sinecure that I had undertaken.\\n\\nand saying that, poor as our family was, none of them had ever fallen so, low as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous, character and doubtful antecedents. I answered that Cullingworth spoke, sometimes of paying his creditors, that Mrs. Cullingworth was in favour, of it also, and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that I, should sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which I had, no connection. I assured her that if Cullingworth did anything from then, onwards which seemed to me dishonourable, I would disassociate myself, from him, and I mentioned that I had already refused to adopt some of, his professional methods. Well, in reply to this, my mother wrote a, pretty violent letter about what she thought of Cullingworth, which led, to another from me defending him, and showing that there were some deep, and noble traits in his character. That produced another still more, outspoken letter from her; and so the correspondence went on, she, attacking and I defending, until a serious breach seemed to be opening, between us. I refrained from writing at last, not out of ill temper, but, because I thought that if she were given time she would cool down, and, take, perhaps, a more reasonable view of the situation. My father, from, the short note which he sent me, seemed to think the whole business, absolutely irregular, and to refuse to believe my accounts of, Cullingworth's practice and receipts. This double opposition, from the, very people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the, whole affair, caused me to be less disappointed than I should otherwise, have been when it all came to an end. In fact, I was quite in the humour, to finish it myself when Fate did it for me.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said I, \\\"that that is rather further than I am prepared, to go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain, friction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well, that I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall, be happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take, over my duties.\\\"\\n\\nYou make a mistake, however, in assuming that those who think as I, do are such a miserable minority. The whole essence of our thought is, independence and individual judgment; so that we don't get welded into, single bodies as the churches do, and have no opportunity of testing our, own strength. There are, no doubt, all shades of opinion among us; but, if you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the, doctrines usually accepted, and think that sectarian churches tend, to evil rather than good, I fancy that the figures would be rather, surprising. When I read your letter, I made a list of all those men with, whom I ever had intimate talk upon such matters. I got seventeen names\\n\\nthey have the merit of being consoling; for if we could conscientiously, see that sin served a purpose, and a good one, it would take some of the, blackness out of life. It seems to me, then, that Nature, still working, on the lines of evolution, strengthens the race in two ways. The one is, by improving those who are morally strong, which is done by increased, knowledge and broadening religious views; the other, and hardly less, important, is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally, weak. This is accomplished by drink and immorality. These are really two, of the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of, the race. I picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the, garden of life and plucking up the weeds. Looked at in one's own day\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" he explained, \\\"there's no good my putting a forty pound suite, into a bed-room, and then having to chuck it all out of the window in, order to make room for a hundred-pound one. No sense in that, Munro!, Eh, what! I'm going to furnish this house as no house has ever been, furnished. By Crums! I'll bring the folk from a hundred miles round just, to have leave to look at it. But I must do it room by room. Come down, with me and look at the dining-room. You must be hungry after your, journey.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then I have seen something of the same sort in Cullingworth; but, he is so strange a being that I never attach much importance to his, variations. He glares at me like an angry bull occasionally; and then, when I ask him what is the matter, he growls out, \\\"Oh, nothing!\\\" and, turns on his heel. Then at other times he is so cordial and friendly, that he almost overdoes it, and I find myself wondering whether he is, not acting. It must seem ungracious to you that I should speak so of a, man who has been my benefactor; and it seems so to me also, but still, that IS the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes. It's an, absurd idea, too; for what possible object could his wife and he have, in pretending to be amiable, if they did not really feel so? And yet you, know the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not, with his eyes.\\n\\nnever returned. I fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited, their confidence. Others have become warm partisans. But they have, nearly all been very poor people; and when you consider how many one and, sixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which, I must find every quarter for rent, taxes, gas and water, you will, understand that even with some success, I have still found it a hard, matter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder., However, my boy, two quarters are paid up, and I enter upon a third one, with my courage unabated. I have lost about a stone, but not my heart.\\n\\nfrom boot-blacking to medicine-carrying. His one dissipation is cutting, out of paper, or buying in lead (on the rare occasion when we find a, surplus), an army of little soldiers. I have brought a patient into the, consulting room, and found a torrent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, pouring across the table. I have been myself attacked as I sat silently, writing, and have looked up to find fringes of sharp-shooters pushing, up towards me, columns of infantry in reserve, a troop of cavalry on my, flank, while a battery of pea muzzle-loaders on the ridge of my medical, dictionary has raked my whole position--with the round, smiling face of, the general behind it all. I don't know how many regiments he has on a, peace footing; but if serious trouble were to break out, I am convinced, that every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms.\\n\\nIn that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty, night. He was gaily dressed in the first place, check trousers, white, waistcoat, a flower in his button hole. But the look of the man was, very much to my heart. He was ruddy checked and black eyed, with a jolly, stout figure and an honest genial smile. I felt as we clinched hands in, the foggy grimy station that I had met a man and a friend.\\n\\nWell, then, it was night when we reached Avonmouth, and as I popped my, head out of the carriage window, the first thing that my eyes rested, upon was old Cullingworth, standing in, the circle of light under a, gas-lamp. His frock coat was flying open, his waistcoat unbuttoned at, the top, and his hat (a top hat this time) jammed on the back of his, head, with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it. In every way\\n\\nshortly after my start, telling me that he had heard of my proceedings, from my mother, and that he hoped to learn of my success. He is, as I, think you know, an ardent Wesleyan, like all my father's people, and he, told me that the chief Wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend, of his own, that he had learned from him that there was no Wesleyan, doctor, and that, being of a Wesleyan stock myself, if I would present, the enclosed letter of introduction to the minister, I should certainly, find it very much to my advantage. I thought it over, Bertie, and, it seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a, religious organisation to my own advantage, when I condemned them in the, abstract. It was a sore temptation, but I destroyed the letter.\\n\\nShe is a very well-read woman is the mother; she keeps up to date in, French literature as well as in English, and can talk by the hour about, the Goncourts, and Flaubert, and Gautier. Yet she is always hard at, work; and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery. She reads when, she knits, she reads when she scrubs, she even reads when she feeds, her babies. We have a little joke against her, that at an interesting, passage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little, sister's car-hole, the child having turned her head at the critical, instant. Her hands are worn with work, and yet where is the idle woman, who has read as much?\\n\\nHe was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves, then His, existence loses its point, since we and He start upon a different basis., To my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty, and the moral of His life. If He was divine then He COULD not sin, and, there was an end of the matter. We who are not divine and can sin, have, little to learn from a life like that.\\\"\\n\\nWell, this began to look more like business--especially that last, sentence. I took it to Horton, and asked his advice. His opinion was, that I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. So it ended by my, wiring back accepting the partnership--if it is a partnership--and, to-morrow morning I am off to Bradfield with great hopes and a small, portmanteau. I know how interested you are in the personality of, Cullingworth--as every one is who comes, even at second hand, within, range of his influence; and so you may rely upon it that I shall give, you a very full and particular account of all that passes between us. I, am looking forward immensely to seeing him again, and I trust we won't, have any rows.\\n\\nThis was getting too hot, Bertie. I saw all the folly of the thing. I, believed that I might whip him; but at the same time I knew that we were, so much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without, any possible object to serve. For all that, I took my gloves off, and I, think perhaps it was the wisest course after all. If Cullingworth, once thought he had the whiphand of you, you might be sorry for it, afterwards.\\n\\nPoor Whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony. He was staggering, under the weight of a fine Japanese cabinet which he had carried round, from his lodgings. I had asked him to come to the church, and the old, gentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie. Between, ourselves, I had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should, upset him, as in the case of the dinner; but nothing could be more, exemplary than his conduct and appearance. I had introduced him to, Winnie some days before.\\n\\n\\\"Pray step in,\\\" I answered, and waved him into the consulting-room. He, was a pompous, heavy-stepping, thick-voiced sort of person, but to me he, was an angel from on high. I was nervous, and at the same time so afraid, that he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me, that I, found myself drifting into an extravagant geniality. He seated himself, at my invitation and gave a husky cough.\\n\\nyou and I, and have done ever since I have known you. You are true, to your faith, I to my reason--you to your family belief, I to my own, ideas; but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man, and, his affinity for others, depends upon quite other things than views on, abstract questions. Anyway, I can say with all my heart that I wish I, saw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth, sitting, in that ricketty American-leather armchair, with the villanous, lodging-house antimacassar over the back of it. It is good of you to, tell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures; though if I, had not KNOWN that you were so, you may be sure that I should never have, ventured to inflict any of them upon you. My future is now all involved, in obscurity, but it is obvious that the first thing I must do is to, find a fitting house, and my second to cajole the landlord into letting, me enter into possession of it without any prepayment. To that I will, turn myself to-morrow morning, and you shall know the result. Whom, should I hear from the other day but Archie McLagan? Of course it was a, begging letter. You can judge how far I am in a state to lose money; but, in a hot fit I sent him ten shillings, which now, in my cold, I bitterly, regret. With every good wish to you and yours, including your town, your, State, and your great country, yours as ever.\\n\\nI am sure, a most extraordinary figure. Indeed, she looked rather funny, herself, with her palette in one hand, her brush in the other, and the, blank astonishment on her face. I stammered out something about hoping, that she did not mind, which made her more angry than ever. \\\"The, only possible excuse for your conduct, sir, is that you are under the, influence of drink,\\\" said she. \\\"I need not say that we do not require, the services of a medical man in that condition.\\\" I did not try to, disabuse her of the idea, for really I could see no better explanation;, so I beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition. She wrote a letter, to my father about it in the evening, and the old man was very angry, indeed. As to the mother, she is as staunch as steel, and quite prepared, to prove that poor Mrs. A. was a very deep designing person, who had, laid a trap for innocent Johnnie. So there has been a grand row; and not, a soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means, except only, yourself as you read this letter.\\n\\nThen down a winding wooden stair to the basement, where were kitchen, and scullery, dimly lit, and asphalt-floored. As I entered the latter I, stood staring. In every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me., The place was a Golgotha! In that half light the effect was sepulchral., But as I approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished., They were of plaster-of-Paris, and were the leavings evidently of the, dentist, who had been the last tenant. A more welcome sight was a huge, wooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner. It only, wanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room.\\n\\n, The letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so, connected a whole, and to give so plain an account of some of the, troubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the, outset of his career, that I have handed them over to the gentleman who, is about to edit them. There are two of them, the fifth and the ninth\\n\\nand it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing--but then, would come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my, ledger. Where did it come from you will ask. Some from old Whitehall and, his circle of Bohemians. Some from accident cases. Some from new comers, to the town who drifted to me. Some from people whom I met first in, other capacities. An insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to, examine, and that was a very great help. Above all, I learned a fact, which I would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts, as I, have done, a stranger among strangers. Do not think that practice will, come to you. You must go to it. You may sit upon your consulting room, chair until it breaks under you, but without purchase or partnership you, will make little or no progress. The way to do it is to go out, to mix, everywhere with men, to let them know you. You will come back many a, time and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for, you in your absence. Never mind! Go out again. A noisy smoking concert, where you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two, whom you might have seen at home. It took me some time to realise, but I, speak now as one who knows.\\n\\nWait a bit, though! One did. I was awakened at six in the morning one, day by a ringing at my bell, and creeping to the angle of the stair, I saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a top-hat outside. Much, excited, with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head, I ran, back, pulled on some clothes, rushed down, opened the door, and found, myself in the grey morning light face to face with Horton. The good, fellow had come down from Merton in an excursion train, and had been, travelling all night. He had an umbrella under his arm, and two great, straw baskets in each hand, which contained, when unpacked, a cold leg, of mutton, half-a-dozen of beer, a bottle of port, and all sorts of, pasties and luxuries. We had a great day together, and when he rejoined, his excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he, had found.\\n\\neven when we know each other as well as I know you. Why should we, when, that which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of, advance from friendship to intimacy, and from intimacy to something, more sacred still, which can scarcely be written at all, far less made, interesting to another? The time came at last when they were to leave, Birchespool, and my mother and I went round the night before to say, goodbye. Winnie and I were thrown together for an instant.\\n\\nsomebody will be hanged. Questions about this--questions about that. At, last they asked me what I proposed to fasten my magnet to. I answered, to any solid impenetrable object, such as the head of an Admiralty, official. Well, that broke the whole thing up. They wrote with their, compliments, and they were returning my apparatus. I wrote with my, compliments, and they might go to the devil. And so ends a great, historical incident, Munro--eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nBut the thing that took the fun out of him, and made him gnash his, teeth, and stride cursing about the room, was to see a patient walking, up the steps which led to the door of Scarsdale, his opposite neighbour., Scarsdale had a fairly busy practice, and received his people at home, from ten to twelve, so that I got quite used to seeing Cullingworth fly, out of his chair, and rush raving to the window. He would diagnose, the cases, too, and estimate their money value until he was hardly, articulate.\\n\\nquiet-voiced and gentle-mannered. You had only to see the way in which, she looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his, control, and that do what he might, or say what he might, it would, always be the best thing to her. She could be obstinate, too, in a, gentle, dove-like sort of way; but her obstinacy lay always in the, direction of backing up his sayings and doings. This, however, I was, only to find out afterwards; and at that, my first visit, she impressed, me as being one of the sweetest little women that I had ever known.\\n\\nand I felt much more cheery by the time I had finished my letter. I was, just addressing the envelope (observe what a continuous narrative you, get of my proceedings!) when I was set jumping out of my carpet slippers, by a ring at the bell. Through the glass panel I observed that it was a, respectable-looking bearded individual with a top-hat. It was a patient., It MUST be a patient! Then first I realised what an entirely different, thing it is to treat the patient of another man (as I had done with, Horton) or to work a branch of another man's practice (as I had done, with Cullingworth), and to have to do with a complete stranger on your, own account. I had been thrilling to have one. Now that he had come I, felt for an instant as if I would not open the door. But of course that, was only a momentary weakness. I answered his ring with, I fear, rather, a hypocritical air of insouciance, as though I had happened to find, myself in the hall, and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the, stairs.\\n\\nNext morning I came round to my house--MY house, my boy!--for good, and all, after paying off my landlady. Her bill came to more than I, expected, for I only had breakfast and tea, always \\\"dining out\\\" as I, majestically expressed it. However, it was a relief to me to get it, settled, and to go round with my box to Oakley Villas. An ironmonger had, fixed my plate on to the railings for half-a-crown the evening before\\n\\nWell, it was nearly six o'clock, and evening was just creeping in when, we drew up in Bradfield Station. The first thing I saw when I looked out, of the window was Cullingworth, exactly the same as ever, striding in, his jerky way down the platform, his coat flying open, his chin thrust, forward (he is the most under-hung man I have ever seen), and his great, teeth all gleaming, like a good-natured blood-hound. He roared with, delight when he saw me, wrung my hand, and slapped me enthusiastically, upon the shoulder.\\n\\nAnd certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin, laying down laws about the future; for how do we know that there are not, phases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception?, After all, a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average, life is of the period during which we know that the world has been in, existence. But if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight, his, son the same, and his son the same, what would their united experiences, after a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call, night? So all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth, is not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception.\\n\\n\\\"There are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of, handling patients,\\\" he remarked, seating himself on the table and, swinging his legs. \\\"The most obvious is that you must never let them see, that you want them. It should be pure condescension on your part seeing, them at all; and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it, the, more they think of it. Break your patients in early, and keep them well, to heel. Never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many, foolish young men fall into this habit, and are ruined in consequence., Now, this is my form\\\"--he sprang to the door, and putting his two hands, to his mouth he bellowed: \\\"Stop your confounded jabbering down there! I, might as well be living above a poultry show! There, you see,\\\" he added, to me, \\\"they will think ever so much more of me for that.\\\"\\n\\nand skims plates out of the window at the passers-by. Of course, it is, really not funny, but pathetic and deplorable--all the same, it is hard, to keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and, her appearance. I was called in by accident in the first instance; but I, speedily acquired some control over her, so that now the neighbours send, for me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window. She, has a fair competence, so that her little vagaries are a help to me with, my rent. She has, too, a number of curious jugs, statues, and pictures\\n\\nWell, I know that I am a shocking bad story-teller, but I just try to, get things as near the truth as I can manage it. If I only knew how to, colour it up, I could make some of this better reading. I can get along, when I am on one line, but it is when I have to bring in a second line, of events that I understand what C. means when he says that I will never, be able to keep myself in nibs by what I earn in literature.\\n\\nOnce he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge, shop, a place that had been a raper's, with a counter about sixty feet, long. His reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a, little further down on the other side. Poor old \\\"armed transport\\\" worked, so hard that I could not help being touched and grateful; yet I longed, from my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent\\n\\n, Birchespool is really a delightful place, dear Bertie; and I ought to, know something about it, seeing that I have padded a good hundred miles, through its streets during the last seven days. Its mineral springs used, to be quite the mode a century or more ago; and it retains many traces, of its aristocratic past, carrying it with a certain grace, too, as an, emigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled, in Versailles. I forget the new roaring suburbs with their out-going, manufactures and their incoming wealth, and I live in the queer, health-giving old city of the past. The wave of fashion has long passed, over it, but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind., In the High Street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the, railings where the link-boys used to put out their torches, instead of, stamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement, as was the custom, in less high-toned quarters. There are the very high curbstones too\\n\\n\\\"But what is mother to do?\\\" cried the girl, taking up the tale again., \\\"No hotel or lodging-house would take us in while poor Fred is like, that. And we have not the heart to send him to an asylum. Uncle will not, have us any longer, and we have nowhere to go to.\\\" Her grey eyes tried, to look brave, but her mouth would go down at the corners.\\n\\nis either extinct or on the way towards it. Struma, tubercle, nervous, disease, have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten, branch, and the average of the race is thereby improved. I believe from, the little that I have seen of life, that it is a law which acts with, startling swiftness, that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate, their species at all, and that when the curse is hereditary, the second, generation generally sees the end of it.\\n\\n\\\"We must do what we can to make up. Now, I tell you what I am prepared, to do. I was talking about it with Hetty this morning, and she thought, as I did. If we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your, legs under you, it would encourage you to start for yourself, and you, could pay it back as soon as you were able.\\\"\\n\\nIf Cullingworth still bore any resentment, he concealed it most, admirably. But then I knew by experience that that genial loud-voiced, John-Bull manner of his COULD conceal many things. His wife was more, open; and I could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes, that, she at least stood fast to the old quarrel. Cullingworth was little, changed, and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we'll see about that when they do. Meanwhile I am paying ready, money for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps. They think so, well of me here that I could have had the whole place furnished like a, palace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff, only I determined to take, each room in turn when I was ready for it. There's nearly four hundred, pounds under this one ceiling.\\\"\\n\\nStill I must confess that there is nothing about Cullingworth which jars, me so much as the low view which he takes of our profession. I can never, reconcile myself to his ideas, and yet I can never convert him to mine;, so there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide, us altogether. He will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the, question. A profession, in his view, is a means of earning a livelihood\\n\\n\\\"Very good. You are also aware, I presume, that modern projectiles are, either made of or tipped with steel. It may possibly have come to your, ears that magnets attract steel. Permit me now to show you a small, experiment.\\\" He bent over his apparatus, and I suddenly heard the, snapping of electricity. \\\"This,\\\" he continued going across to the, packing case, \\\"is a saloon pistol, and will be exhibited in the museums, of the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was, inaugurated. Into the breech I place a Boxer cartridge, specialty, provided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet. I aim point, blank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall, which is four inches, above the magnet. I am an absolutely dead shot. I fire. You will now, advance, and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end, of the magnet, after which you will apologise to me for that grin.\\\"\\n\\nHeigh ho! it's nearly dawn, and I as wakeful as ever. It is chilly, and, I have draped a blanket round me. I've heard that this is the favourite, hour of the suicide, and I see that I've been tailing off in the, direction of melancholy myself. Let me wind up on a lighter chord by, quoting Cullingworth's latest article. I must tell you that he is, still inflamed by the idea of his own paper, and his brain is in full, eruption, sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs\\n\\nwe are too apt to overlook the ninety-nine decent folk by their own, firesides. I shall not make that mistake any more. The kindliness of the, poor to the poor makes a man sick of himself. And their sweet patience!, Depend upon it, if ever there is a popular rising, the wrongs which lead, to it must be monstrous and indefensible. I think the excesses of the, French Revolution are dreadful enough in themselves, but much more so as, an index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad, protest. And then the wisdom of the poor! It is amusing to read the glib, newspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses. They don't, know the date of Magna Charta, or whom John of Gaunt married; but put, a practical up-to-date problem before them, and see how unerringly they, take the right side. Didn't they put the Reform Bill through in the, teeth of the opposition of the majority of the so-called educated, classes? Didn't they back the North against the South when nearly all, our leaders went wrong? When universal arbitration and the suppression, of the liquor traffic comes, is it not sure to be from the pressure of, these humble folks? They look at life with clearer and more unselfish, eyes. It's an axiom, I think, that to heighten a nation's wisdom you, must lower its franchise.\\n\\nWhen I woke next morning he was in my room, and a funny-looking object, he was. His dressing-gown lay on a chair, and he was putting up a, fifty-six pound dumb-bell, without a rag to cover him. Nature didn't, give him a very symmetrical face, nor the sweetest of expressions; but, he has a figure like a Greek statue. I was amused to see that both his, eyes had a touch of shadow to them. It was his turn to grin when I, sat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a, toadstool. However, he was all for peace that morning, and chatted away, in the most amiable manner possible.\\n\\nand began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the, three hundred spectators. It was fine to see the deliberate way in which, he picked his way among the ink bottles. As he sprang down from the last, bench on to the floor, his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in, the face. Cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him, however, and rushed, him backwards out of the class-room. What he did with him I don't know\\n\\nI was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this, rigmarole. When he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box, and, we could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair. I, was still looking at the medal, which, from the dents all over it, had, evidently been often used as a target, when I felt a timid touch upon my, sleeve; it was Mrs. Cullingworth, who was looking earnestly at me with a, very distressed expression upon her face.\\n\\nfor you could never tell what it might lead to. His temper was nothing, less than infernal. I have seen him in the dissecting-rooms begin to, skylark with a fellow, and then in an instant the fun would go out of, his face, his little eyes would gleam with fury, and the two would be, rolling, worrying each other like dogs, below the table. He would, be dragged off, panting and speechless with fury, with his wiry hair, bristling straight up like a fighting terrier's.\\n\\nwhich was as welcome to me, and as much of a windfall, as the Spanish, wreck to Robinson Crusoe. There were too pairs of thick blankets, two, sheets, a counterpane, a pillow, a camp-stool, two stuffed bears' paws, (of all things in this world!), two terra-cotta vases, a tea-cosy, two, pictures in frames, several books, an ornamental ink-pot, and a number, of antimacassars and coloured tablecloths. It is not until you own a, table with a deal top and mahogany legs, that you understand what the, true inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is. Right on the top of this, treasure came a huge hamper from the Apothecaries' Society with the, drugs which I had ordered. When they were laid out in line, the bottles, extended right down one side of the dining-room and half down the other., As I walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions, I, felt less radical in my views, and begun to think that there might be, something in the rights of property after all.\\n\\nas they do in the mediaeval churches, he might, I am sure, paper, his consulting room with them. A favourite device of his with an, impressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure. \\\"My, dear,\\\" he will say, swaying some girl about by the shoulders, with his, nose about three inches from hers, \\\"you'll feel better to-morrow at a, quarter to ten, and at twenty past you'll be as well as ever you were in, your life. Now, keep your eye on the clock, and see if I am not right.\\\", Next day, as likely as not, her mother will be in, weeping tears of, joy; and another miracle has been added to Cullingworth's record. It may, smell of quackery, but it is exceedingly useful to the patient.\\n\\nIn the meantime I had enlisted a most unexpected ally. On the second, evening a card was solemnly brought up by the landlady's daughter from, the lodger who occupied the room below. On it was inscribed \\\"Captain, Whitehall\\\"; and then underneath, in brackets, \\\"Armed Transport.\\\" On, the back of the card was written, \\\"Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), presents his compliments to Dr. Munro, and would be glad of his, company to supper at 8.30.\\\" To this I answered, \\\"Dr. Munro presents his, compliments to Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), and will be most, happy to accept his kind invitation.\\\" What \\\"Armed Transport\\\" might mean, I had not an idea, but I thought it well to include it, as he seemed so, particular about it himself.\\n\\nFirst of all, about the practice. I told you that I was to have a room, immediately opposite to Cullingworth's, and that all the surgical cases, were to be turned over to me. For a few days I had nothing to do, except, to listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients, or making, speeches to them from the top of the stairs. However, a great \\\"Dr. Stark, Munro, Surgeon,\\\" has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs\\n\\nTalking of cheeriness, you misunderstand me, Bertie, if you think (as, you seem to imply) that I take a dark view of things. It is true that I, discard some consolations which you possess, because I cannot convince, myself that they are genuine; but in this world, at least, I see immense, reason for hope, and as to the next I am confident that all will be for, the best. From annihilation to beatification I am ready to adapt myself, to whatever the great Designer's secret plan my be.\\n\\nSo the Cullingworths did their bag-procession through the doctors', quarter alone to-day, and I walked to the park, where I sat down on one, of the seats, lit a cigar, and thought the whole matter over. I was down, on my luck at first; but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the, budding flowers soon set me right again. I began my last letter among, the stars, and I am inclined to finish this one among the flowers, for, they are rare companions when one's mind is troubled. Most things on, this earth, from a woman's beauty to the taste of a nectarine, seem to, be the various baits with which Nature lures her silly gudgeons. They, shall eat, they shall propagate, and for the sake of pleasing themselves, they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them. But, there lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower. It's charm, has no ulterior motive.\\n\\nAnd this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair., Cullingworth, who had drunk off a couple of glasses, waited until his, wife had left the room, and then began to talk of the difficulty of, getting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of, patients. This led us round to the ways in which a man might take his, exercise indoors, and that to boxing. Cullingworth took a couple of, pairs of gloves out of a cupboard, and proposed that we should fight a, round or two then and there.\\n\\nNow, first of all, I want to tell you about how the practice has been, going on. The week after I wrote last showed a slight relapse. I only, took two pounds. But on the next I took a sudden jump up to three pounds, seven shillings, and this last week I took three pounds ten. So it was, steadily creeping up; and I really thought that I saw my road clear, in front of me, when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue. There were, reasons, however, which prevented my being very disappointed when it did, come down; and these I must make clear to you.\\n\\nWell, with half-an-hour for lunch, this extraordinary business went, on till a quarter to four in the afternoon. When the last patient had, departed, Cullingworth led the way into the dispensary, where all the, fees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value., There were seventeen half-sovereigns, seventy-three shillings, and, forty-six florins; or thirty-two pounds eight and sixpence in all., Cullingworth counted it up, and then mixing the gold and silver into, one heap, he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it., Finally, he raked it into the canvas bag which I had seen the night, before, and lashed the neck up with a boot-lace.\\n\\nWell, she had heard some details about the Cullingworths which, displeased her when I first knew them. Then came the smash-up at, Avonmouth, and my mother liked them less and less. She was averse to my, joining them in Bradfield, and it was only by my sudden movement at the, end that I escaped a regular prohibition. When I got there, the very, first question she asked (when I told her of their prosperity) was, whether they had paid their Avonmouth creditors. I was compelled to, answer that they had not. In reply she wrote imploring me to come away\\n\\nHis wisdom, His forethought for small wants, His providing of luxuries, for His creatures. On the other hand, do not let us be disingenuous, enough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain, in cruelty, in all which, seems to be a slur upon His work. The best that we can say for them is, to hope that they are not as bad as they seem, and possibly lead to some, higher end. The voices of the ill-used child and of the tortured animal, are the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer.\\n\\nwhen the main trunk is rotten beneath them, and both must in their, present forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin. The movement, of human thought, though slow, is still in the direction of truth, and, the various religions which man sheds as he advances (each admirable in, its day) will serve, like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel, to, give the rate and direction of his progress.\\n\\nAnd now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole, life. Whom do you think I had a letter from last Tuesday week? From, Cullingworth, no less. It had no beginning, no end, was addressed, all wrong, and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a, prescription. How it ever reached me is a wonder. This is what he had to, say:--\\n\\nseemed to fall away, and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable, Guide of the Universe were for an instant face to face. I was on my, knees--hurled down all against my own will, as it were. And even then, I could find no words to say. Only vague yearnings and emotions and a, heartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good. What could, I say? Every prayer seemed based on the idea that God was a magnified, man--that He needed asking and praising and thanking. Should the cog of, the wheel creak praise to the Engineer? Let it rather cog harder, and, creak less. Yet I did, I confess, try to put the agitation of my soul, into words. I meant it for a prayer; but when I considered afterwards, the \\\"supposing thats\\\" and \\\"in case ofs\\\" with which it was sprinkled, it, must have been more like a legal document. And yet I felt soothed and, happier as I went downstairs again.\\n\\nI have often wondered why some of those writing fellows don't try their, hands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of, puberty until he begins to find his feet a little. Men are very fond, of analysing the feelings of their heroines, which they cannot possibly, know anything about, while they have little to say of the inner, development of their heroes, which is an experience which they have, themselves undergone. I should like to try it myself, but it would need, blending with fiction, and I never had a spark of imagination. But I, have a vivid recollection of what I went through myself. At the time I, thought (as everybody thinks) that it was a unique experience; but since, I have heard the confidences of my father's patients I am convinced that, it is the common lot. The shrinking, horrible shyness, alternating with, occasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against, it, the longing for close friendship, the agonies over imaginary, slights, the extraordinary sexual doubts, the deadly fears caused by, non-existent diseases, the vague emotion produced by all women, and the, half-frightened thrill by particular ones, the aggressiveness caused, by fear of being afraid, the sudden blacknesses, the profound, self-distrust--I dare bet that you have felt every one of them, Bertie\\n\\nis pronounced by Dr. Stark Munro, of Oakley Villa, to have suffered no, serious injury.\\\" As Cullingworth used to say, it is hard enough for the, young doctor to push his name into any publicity, and he must take what, little chances he has. Perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake, their heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal; but, I was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing, their own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in The, Times.\\n\\nYou'll see from the address of this letter, Bertie, that I have left, Scotland and am in Yorkshire. I have been here three months, and am now, on the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the, queerest prospects. Good old Cullingworth has turned out a trump, as I, always knew he would. But, as usual, I am beginning at the wrong end, so, here goes to give you an idea of what has been happening.\\n\\nWhat should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture, submitted to him, and who, having satisfied himself that the account, given of the painting of the picture is incorrect, at once concludes, that no one ever painted it, or at least asserts that he has no possible, means of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not? That is, as, it seems to me, a fair statement of the position of some of the more, extreme agnostics. \\\"Is not the mere existence of the picture in itself, a proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it? one might ask.\\\", \\\"Why, no,\\\" says the objector. \\\"It is possible that the picture produced, itself by the aid of certain rules. Besides, when the picture was first, submitted to me I was assured that it had all been produced within a, week, but by examining it I am able to say with certainty that it has, taken a considerable time to put together. I am therefore of opinion, that it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all.\\\"\\n\\nSo ends the history of a failure. I am, as you know, inclined to, fatalism, and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists; so I am, bound to think that this experience was given to me for some end. It, was a preliminary canter for the big race, perhaps. My mother was, disappointed, but tried to show it as little as possible. My father, was a little sardonic over the matter. I fear that the gap between us, widens. By the way, an extraordinary card arrived from Cullingworth, during my absence. \\\"You are my man,\\\" said he; \\\"mind that I am to have, you when I want you.\\\" There was no date and no address, but the postmark, was Bradfield in the north of England. Does it mean nothing? Or may it, mean everything? We must wait and see.\\n\\n, Well, the second person whom I admitted through my door was the High, Church curate of the parish--at least, I deduced High Church from his, collar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain. He seemed to be, a fine upstanding manly fellow--in fact, I am bound in honesty to admit, that I have never met the washy tea-party curate outside the pages of, Punch. As a body, I think they would compare very well in manliness (I, do not say in brains) with as many young lawyers or doctors. Still, I, have no love for the cloth. Just as cotton, which is in itself the most, harmless substance in the world, becomes dangerous on being dipped into, nitric acid, so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once, soaked in sectarian religion. If he has any rancour or hardness in him, it will bring it out. I was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my, visitor, though I trust that I received him with fitting courtesy. The, quick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my, consulting-room, told me that it was not quite what he had expected.\\n\\nMy red drugget I laid out in the centre, and fastened it down with, brass-headed nails. It looked much smaller than I had hoped,--a little, red island on an ocean of deal board, or a postage stamp in the middle, of an envelope. In the centre of it I placed my table, with three, medical works on one side of it, and my stethoscope and dresser's case, upon the other. One chair went with the table, of course; and then I, spent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other, two looked better together--a dense block of chairs, as it were--or, scattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous, chairs. I placed them finally one on the right, and one in front of, the table. Then I put down my fender, and nailed \\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo, Players,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle\\\" on to three of the walls, with the mental, promise that my first spare half-crown should buy a picture for the, fourth. In the window I placed my little square table, and balanced upon, it a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which I, had brought in my trunk. Finally, I found a pair of dark brown curtains, among the job lot which I had bought at the sale, and these I put up and, drew pretty close together, so that a subdued light came into the room\\n\\nwith the bustle of green tree tops. It was a windy day, and the clouds, were drifting swiftly across the heavens, with glimpses of blue between., I don't know how it was, but as I stood looking through the grimy panes, in the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my, responsibility to some higher power came upon me, with a vividness which, was overpowering. Here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened., What was to be the end of it? I had strength, I had gifts. What was I, going to do with them? All the world, the street, the cabs, the houses\\n\\nYou'll wonder what has taken me off on this line. Only that I seem, to see it all in action in my own life. But, as usual, I have started, merrily off with an appendix, so I shall go back and begin my report, as nearly as possible where I ended the last. First of all, I may, say generally that the clouds were thinning then, and that they broke, shortly afterwards. During the last few months we have never once quite, lost sight of the sun.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, curse the politics! Red pepper well rubbed in, that's my idea of a, paper. Call it the Scorpion. Chaff the Mayor and the Council until they, call a meeting and hang themselves. I'd do the snappy paragraphs, and, you would do the fiction and poetry. I thought about it during the, night, and Hetty has written to Murdoch's to get an estimate for the, printing. We might get our first number out this day week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you've got your armour there, laddie, it will be pierced,\\\" says he., \\\"Put up forty feet thick of steel; and I'll build a gun that will knock, it into tooth-powder. It would blow away, and set the folk coughing, after I had one shot at it. But you can't pierce armour which only drops, after the shot has passed through. What's the good of it? Why it, keeps out the water. That's the main thing, after all. I call it the, Cullingworth spring-shutter screen. Eh, what, Munro? I wouldn't take, a quarter of a million for the idea. You see how it would work. Spring, shutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks, used to be. They are in sections, three feet broad, we will say, and, capable when let down of reaching the keel. Very well! Enemy sends a, shot through Section A of the side. Section A shutter is lowered. Only, a thin film, you see, but enough to form a temporary plug. Enemy's ram, knocks in sections B, C, D of the side. What do you do? Founder? Not, a bit; you lower sections B, C, and D of Cullingworth's spring-shutter, screen. Or you knock a hole on a rock. The same thing again. It's a, ludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution, would absolutely save her. And it's equally good for ironclads also. A, shot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them., Down go your shutters, and all is well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I could. Such a novel, Munro, that when they'd read the first, chapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out., They'd wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was, coming next. By Crums, I'll go and begin it now!\\\" And, with another, somersault over the end of the bed, he rushed from the room, with the, tassels of his dressing gown flying behind him.\\n\\nhis guards, and his cellars of wine in a more logical position. They are, all good and talented men, and in the market of brains are worth perhaps, as much as they get. But how can they bring themselves to pose as the, representatives of a creed, which, as they themselves expound it, is, based upon humility, poverty, and self-denial? Not one of them who, would not quote with approval the parable of the Wedding Guest. But, try putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next Court, reception. It happened some little time ago with a Cardinal, and England, rang with his protests. How blind not to see how they would spring at, one leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim, the last as the special badge of their master!\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said I, \\\"that's easily set right.\\\" I marched out of the room and, downstairs, with both Cullingworth and his wife behind me. Into the yard, I went, and, picking up a big hammer, I started for the front door, with, the pair still at my heels. I got the forked end of the hammer under my, plate, and with a good wrench I brought the whole thing clattering on to, the pavement.\\n\\nBut if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its, honey bag and its collecting forceps, and for the lowly seed so as to, have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil, then is it, conceivable that we, the highest product of all, are overlooked? It is, NOT conceivable. The idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as, we see it. I say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty, of a most watchful Providence.\\n\\nI'll give you an idea of what a day's work is like. We breakfast about, nine o'clock, and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to, drop in. Many of them are very poor people, belonging to the colliery, clubs, the principle of which is, that the members pay a little over a, halfpenny a week all the year round, well or ill, in return for which, they get medicine and attendance free. \\\"Not much of a catch for the, doctors,\\\" you would say, but it is astonishing what competition there, is among them to get the appointment. You see it is a certainty for, one thing, and it leads indirectly to other little extras. Besides, it, amounts up surprisingly. I have no doubt that Horton has five or six, hundred a year from his clubs alone. On the other hand, you can imagine, that club patients, since they pay the same in any case, don't let their, ailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room.\\n\\nCullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper. He has carried, the matter through with his usual energy, but he doesn't know enough, about local affairs to be able to write about them, and it is a question, whether he can interest the people here in anything else. At present we, are prepared to run the paper single-handed; we are working seven hours, a day at the practice; we are building a stable; and in our odd hours we, are practising at our magnetic ship-protector, with which Cullingworth, is still well pleased, though he wants to get it more perfect before, submitting it to the Admiralty.\\n\\nWas it not fine? It stirred my blood, and the words rang like a bugle, call in my head. It braced me, and the time was coming when all the, bracing I could get would not be too much. I copied it out, and pinned, it on one side of my mantel-piece. On the other I stuck up a chip from, Carlyle, which I daresay is as familiar to you as to me. \\\"One way or, another all the light, energy, and available virtue which we have does, come out of us, and goes very infallibly into God's treasury, living and, working through eternities there. We are not lost--not a single atom, of us--of one of us.\\\" Now, there is a religious sentence which is, intellectually satisfying, and therefore morally sound.\\n\\nWell, I really never intended to inflict all this upon you, Bertie. I, thought I could have made my position clear in a page or so. But you can, see how one point has brought up another. Even now I am leaving so much, unsaid. I can see with such certainty exactly what you will say. \\\"If, you deduce a good Providence from the good things in nature, what do, you make of the evil?\\\" That's what you will say. Suffice it that I am, inclined to deny the existence of evil. Not another word will I say upon, the subject; but if you come back to it yourself, then be it on your own, head.\\n\\nTo some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them, to say one. With a loud \\\"hush\\\" he would rush at them, thump them on the, chests, listen to their hearts, write their labels, and then run them, out of the room by their shoulders. One poor old lady he greeted with a, perfect scream. \\\"You've been drinking too much tea!\\\" he cried. \\\"You are, suffering from tea poisoning!\\\" Then, without allowing her to get a word, in, he clutched her by her crackling black mantle, dragged her up to the, table, and held out a copy of \\\"Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence\\\" which was, lying there. \\\"Put your hand on the book,\\\" he thundered, \\\"and swear that, for fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa.\\\" She swore with, upturned eyes, and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand\\n\\nIs he not a conundrum? If he interests you at a distance (and I take, for granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional, compliment) you can think how piquant he is in actual life. I must, confess, however, that I can never shake off the feeling that I am, living with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may, possibly bite. Well, it won't be very long before I write again, and, by that time I shall probably know whether I am likely to find, any permanent billet here or not. I am so sorry to hear about Mrs., Swanborough's indisposition. You know that I take the deepest interest, in everything that affects you. They tell me here that I am looking very, fit, though I think they ought to spell it with an \\\"a.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you, Bertie, the tears started to my eyes, and I could hardly, gulp out a word or two of thanks. What a crisscross of qualities in, one human soul! It was not the deed or the words; but it was the almost, womanly look in the eyes of this broken, drink-sodden old Bohemian--the, sympathy and the craving for sympathy which I read there. Only for an, instant though, for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half, defiant manner.\\n\\nwho leaned upon his Martini, with two little white kittens peeping over, either shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack. I was so moved at the, sight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old, country, that I sprang up on my box, took off my hat, and gave them, three cheers. At first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine, fashion--like a row of cows over a wall. At the second a good many, joined, and at the third my own voice was entirely lost. So I turned to, go my way, and the soldier laddies to go theirs; and I wondered which of, us had the stiffest and longest fight before us.\\n\\nDreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind, but I thought, of her nose and was reassured. An examination revealed everything. She, was a married woman. The lines were solemnly produced. Her husband was a, seaman. She had passed as a miss, because she thought I was more likely, to take a housekeeper without encumbrances. Her husband had come home, unexpectedly from a long voyage, and had returned last night. And, then--plot within plot--the other woman was not her sister, but a, friend, whose name was Miss Williams. She thought I was more likely to, take two sisters than two friends. So we all came to know who the other, was; and I, having given Jack permission to remain, assigned the other, top room to Miss Williams. From absolute solitude I seemed to be rapidly, developing into the keeper of a casual ward.\\n\\nhowever, part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact, that whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort, his exact, opposite at once springs up to neutralise him. You have a Mameluke: up, jumps a Crusader. You have a Fenian: up jumps an Orangeman. Every force, has its recoil. And so these more hide-bound scientists must be set, against those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in, the year 4004 B. C.\\n\\nI had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me, into the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as, to our financial position. He began the interview by unbuttoning his, waistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space, two, inches from the left sternal line. I did so, and was shocked to hear a, well-marked mitral regurgitant murmur.\\n\\nIf I hadn't been a fool, Bertie, I should never have consented. It's, one of my many weaknesses, that, whether it's a woman or a man, anything, like a challenge sets me off. But I knew Cullingworth's ways, and I told, you in my last what a lamb of a temper he has. None the less, we pushed, back the table, put the lamp on a high bracket, and stood up to one, another.\\n\\nfor it was merely a prospecting expedition, and I intended to return for, my luggage if I saw reason for hope. Alas! there was not the faintest., The sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that, ever lived. It is one of those picturesque little English towns with, a history and little else. A Roman trench and a Norman keep are its, principal products. But to me the most amazing thing about it was the, cloud of doctors which had settled upon it. A double row of brass plates, flanked the principal street. Where their patients came from I could not, imagine, unless they practised upon each other. The host of the \\\"Bull\\\", where I had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by, saying that, as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly, twelve miles in every direction, it was in these scattered farm-houses, that the Stockwell doctors found their patients. As I chatted with him a, middle-aged, dusty-booted man trudged up the street. \\\"There's Dr. Adam,\\\", said he. \\\"He's only a new-comer, but they say that some o' these days, he'll be starting his carriage.\\\" \\\"What do you mean by a new-comer?\\\", I asked. \\\"Oh, he's scarcely been here ten years,\\\" said the landlord., \\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"Can you tell me when the next train leaves for, Bradfield?\\\" So back I came, rather heavy at heart, and having spent, ten or twelve shillings which I could ill afford. My fruitless journey, seemed a small thing, however, when I thought of the rising Stockwellite, with his ten years and his dusty boots. I can trudge along a path\\n\\nand, as we are all very fond of the kind old lady, we were trying to, keep things as quiet as possible down-stairs. Suddenly there came, a bang! bang! bang! at the knocker; and then in an instant another, rattling series of knocks, as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick, in the panel. After all our efforts for silence it was exasperating. I, rushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand, to commence a fresh bombardment. \\\"What on earth's the matter?\\\" I asked\\n\\nBut there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man's heart, singing. Good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle., The race is improving. There are far fewer criminal convictions. There, is far more education. People sin less and think more. When I meet a, brutal looking fellow I often think that he and his type may soon be, as extinct as the great auk. I am not sure that in the interest of the, 'ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of Bill Sykes, to show, our children's children what sort of a person he was.\\n\\nI cannot be bigoted, my dear boy, when I say from the bottom of my heart, that I respect every good Catholic and every good Protestant, and that, I recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful, instrument in the hands of that inscrutable Providence which rules, all things. Just as in the course of history one finds that the most, far-reaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime; so in, religion, although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate, conception of the Creator and His ways, it may none the less be the very, best practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it. But, if it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to, adopt it, it is equally so for those to whom it is not, to protest, against it, until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets, gradually leavened, and pushed a little further upon their slow upward, journey.\\n\\nHowever, the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my, attention and breaking the blow which I had had in the Cullingworth, letter. It made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should, prove to be a patient, and the apparent patient an outsider. So back, I went, in a much more judicial frame of mind, to read that precious, document over again, and to make up my mind what it was that I should, do.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I had news of Cullingworth from Smeaton, who was in the, same football team at college, and who had called when he was passing, through Bradfield. His report was not a very favourable one. The, practice had declined considerably. People had no doubt accustomed, themselves to his eccentricities, and these had ceased to impress them., Again, there had been one or two coroner's inquests, which had spread, the impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs. If, the coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which Cullingworth had, effected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with, his censures. But, as you can understand, C.'s rival medical men, were not disposed to cover him in any way. He had never had much, consideration for them.\\n\\nWell, I examined him, and I found his own account not very far from the, truth. I went over him carefully from head to foot, and there was not, much left as Nature made it. He had mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of, the liver, Bright's disease, an enlarged spleen, and incipient dropsy., I gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance, if not of total, abstinence; but I fear that my words made no impression. He chuckled\\n\\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Cullingworth and I ran the practice together. As, a substitute for him I was a dreadful failure. They would not believe in, me in the least. I felt that I was as flat as water after champagne., I could not address them from the stairs, nor push them about, nor, prophesy to the anaeemic women. I was much too solemn and demure after, what they had been accustomed to. However, I held the thing together, as best I could, and I don't think that he found the practice much the, worse when he was able to take it over. I could not descend to what I, thought was unprofessional, but I did my very best to keep the wheels, turning.\\n\\ndebating, political, social, athletic, every one of them is a tool to, your hands. But you must show them what a good man you are. You must, throw yourself into each with energy and conviction. You will soon, find yourself on the committee--possibly the secretary, or even in the, presidential chair. Do not grudge labour where the return may be remote, and indirect. Those are the rungs up which one climbs.\\n\\nOur evening occupations just about that time were of a most, extraordinary character. You are aware that there is a substance, called, waxy matter, which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the, course of certain diseases. What this may be and how it is formed has, been a cause for much bickering among pathologists. Cullingworth had, strong views upon the subject, holding that the waxy matter was really, the same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver., But it is one thing to have an idea, and another to be able to prove, it. Above all, we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment. But, fortune favoured us in the most magical way. The Professor of Pathology, had come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition., With pride he exhibited the organ to us in the class-room before, ordering his assistant to remove it to the ice-chest, preparatory to its, being used for microscopical work in the practical class. Cullingworth, saw his chance, and acted on the instant. Slipping out of the classroom\\n\\nseemed to encourage him to become more offensive. At the end of the, match, wanting two to win, I put down the white which was in the jaws of, the pocket. He cried out that this was bad form. I contended that it was, folly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game, and, on, his continuing to make remarks, I appealed to the marker, who took the, same view as I did. This opposition only increased his anger, and he, suddenly broke out into most violent language, abusing me in unmeasured, terms. I said to him, \\\"If you have anything to say to me, Cullingworth\\n\\nwhich was certainly reasonable enough, since no one else could have, written it. Knowing Cullingworth as well as I did, I took it with, reservations and deductions. How could he have made so rapid and, complete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete, stranger? It was incredible. And yet there must be some truth in it, or, he would not invite me to come down and test it. On the whole, I thought, that I had better move very cautiously in the matter; for I was happy, and snug where I was, and kept on putting a little by, which I hoped, would form a nucleus to start me in practice. It is only a few pounds, up to date, but in a year or so it might mount to something. I wrote, to Cullingworth, therefore, thanking him for having remembered me, and, explaining how matters stood.\\n\\nhowever; and if you forced the pace in the morning, he would undress and, go to bed about tea-time, with a full conviction that all the clocks, had gone mad. These two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old, Whitehall had in his own words, \\\"thrown a rope\\\"; and long after I had, gone to bed I could hear the clink of their glasses, and the tapping of, their pipes against the fender in the room below.\\n\\nand use some remarkably bad English. The meaning of it, when all the, \\\"whereas's and aforesaids\\\" were picked out, was, that Winnie had about a, hundred a year of her own. It could not make me love her a shade better, than I did; but at the same time I won't be so absurd as to say that I, was not glad, or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it, would otherwise have been.\\n\\nHe had a dash of the heroic in him. On one occasion he was placed in, such a position that he must choose between compromising a lady, or, springing out of a third-floor window. Without a moment's hesitation he, hurled himself out of the window. As luck would have it, he fell through, a large laurel bush on to a garden plot, which was soft with rain, and, so escaped with a shaking and a bruising. If I have to say anything that, gives a bad impression of the man, put that upon the other side.\\n\\n, I have some recollection, my dear Bertie, that when I wrote you a, rambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago, I wound up, by saying that I might have something more interesting to tell you next, time. Well, so it has turned out! The whole game is up here, and I am, off upon a fresh line of rails altogether. Cullingworth is to go one, way and I another; and yet I am glad to say that there has not been any, quarrel between us. As usual, I have begun my letter at the end, but, I'll work up to it more deliberately now, and let you know exactly how, it came about.\\n\\nIf, Bertie, it had been old student days, I should have sailed straight, in, as you or any other fellow would have done. My flesh crept with my, loathing for the brute. But I had also to think of what I was and where, I was, and what I had come there to do. However, there are some things, which a man cannot stand, so I took a couple of steps forward, put my, hand on the fellow's shoulder, and said in as conciliatory and genial a, voice as I could muster: \\\"Come, come, my lad! Pull yourself together.\\\"\\n\\nThis with her funny manner set the ladies laughing, and the whole, business seemed lighter and easier. I promised to have the room ready, by eight o'clock. Mrs. La Force arranged to bring her son round at that, hour, and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than I deserved;, for after all it was a business matter, and a resident patient was the, very thing that I needed. I was able to assure Mrs. La Force that I, had had a similar case under my charge before--meaning, of course, poor, \\\"Jimmy,\\\" the son of Lord Saltire. Miss Williams escorted them to the, door, and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how I, got through with it, and that I was within sight of my carriage.\\n\\nI recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom, for fear of some imaginary infection. He was haunted, too, with a, perpetual dread of eavesdroppers, which used to make him fly at the door, and fling it open in the middle of his conversation, pouncing out into, the passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act. Once it was, the maid with the tea tray that he caught, I remember; and I can see her, astonished face now, with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar.\\n\\nYou remember that we (Paul and I) had just engaged a certain, Miss Williams to come and keep house for us. I felt that on the, basement-lodger principle I had not control enough; so we now entered, upon a more business-like arrangement, by which a sum (though, alas! an, absurdly small one) was to be paid her for her services. I would it had, been ten times as much, for a better and a more loyal servant man never, had. Our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she re-entered the, house.\\n\\nindirectly I may say that I did so. From that day Lady Saltire was as, rude to me as she could be, and never lost an opportunity of making, attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions. Of these I never, took the slightest notice; but at last on an evil day she went for me, point-blank, so that there was no getting away from her. It was just, at the end of lunch, when the footman had left the room. She had been, talking about Lord Saltire's going up to London to vote upon some, question in the House of Lords.\\n\\nBertie. I send you one or two enormously long letters, burdened, as far, as I can remember them, with all sorts of useless detail. Then, in spite, of your kindly answers and your sympathy, which I have done so little to, deserve, I drop you completely for more than six months. By this J pen, I swear that it shall not happen again; and this letter may serve to, bridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs, in which\\n\\nNo, you mustn't be too sure of that majority of yours. Taking the, scientific, the medical, the professional classes, I question whether it, exists at all. The clergy, busy in their own limited circles, and coming, in contact only with those who agree with them, have not realised how, largely the rising generation has outgrown them. And (with exceptions, like yourself) it is not the most lax, but the BEST of the younger men\\n\\n\\\"As to the magnet,\\\" said he, \\\"I'm very sorry for my country, but there, is no more command of the seas for her. I'll have to let the thing go, to the Germans. It's not my fault. They must not blame me when the smash, comes. I put the thing before the Admiralty, and I could have made a, board school understand it in half the time. Such letters, Munro! Colney, Hatch on blue paper. When the war comes, and I show those letters\\n\\nundisturbed. My tastes are so simple that I cannot imagine any advantage, which wealth can give--save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a, good man or a good cause. Why should people ever take credit for charity, when they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their, guineas in any other fashion? I gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster, the other day (having no change in my pocket), and the mater could not, quite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility. I, could have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one, nor the other, but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little, dash of swagger away down at the bottom of it. What had I ever had from, my chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow, brought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had, been useful?\\n\\nAnd so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that I could not, come. It is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life, obviously divides, and you take one turning or the other after vainly, trying to be sure about the finger-post. I think after all I chose, rightly. A ship's surgeon must remain a ship's surgeon, while here there, is no horizon to my possibilities.\\n\\n\\\"Just exactly in South America,\\\" he cried, pacing with his quick little, steps up and down the dingy room. \\\"Look here, laddie! There's a great, continent from the equator to the icebergs, and not a man in it who, could correct an astigmatism. What do they know of modern eye-surgery, and refraction? Why, dammy, they don't know much about it in the, provinces of England yet, let alone Brazil. Man, if you could only see, it, there's a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round, the whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for, an oculist. Eh, Munro, what? By Crums, I'll come back and I'll buy, Bradfield, and I'll give it away as a tip to a waiter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I'm sorry we haven't got a crowded day for you, Munro,\\\" said he., \\\"Of course, we can't command these things, and must take them as they, come. Now then, now then, make a gangway, can't you?\\\"--this to his, patients. \\\"Come here and see the waiting-room. Pooh! what an atmosphere!, Why on earth can't you open the windows for yourselves? I never saw, such folk! There are thirty people in this room, Munro, and not one with, sense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation.\\\"\\n\\nAt one end of Cadogan Terrace (where I am lodging) there is a wide open, space where several streets meet. In the centre of this stands a large, lamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal, a foot or so high, and ten, or twelve across. Well, as I strolled along I saw there was something, going on round this lamppost. A crowd of people had gathered, with a, swirl in the centre. I was, of course, absolutely determined not to get, mixed up in any row; but I could not help pushing my way through the, crowd to see what was the matter.\\n\\nYou met her, Bertie! You must remember her sweet face, her sensitive, mouth, her peering, short-sighted eyes, her general suggestion of a, plump little hen, who is still on the alert about her chickens. But you, cannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life. Those helpful, fingers! That sympathetic brain! Ever since I can remember her she has, been the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters\\n\\nhave it adopted in every civilised country, see all conceivable, applications of it, count up his probable royalties, sketch out the, novel methods in which he would invest his gains, and finally retire, with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed. And you would, be swept along by his words, and would be carried every foot of the, way with him, so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you, suddenly fell back to earth again, and found yourself trudging the city, street a poor student, with Kirk's Physiology under your arm, and hardly, the price of your luncheon in your pocket.\\n\\nHe began to laugh at that. \\\"It was a little precipitate on my part,\\\", said he; \\\"but I do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to, position or terms. You may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of, our client, Lord Saltire? Not? To put it briefly then, his son, the Hon., James Derwent, the heir to the estates and the only child, was struck, down by the sun while fishing without his hat last July. His mind has, never recovered from the shock, and he has been ever since in a chronic, state of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into, violent mania. His father will not allow him to be removed from, Lochtully Castle, and it is his desire that a medical man should stay, there in constant attendance upon his son. Your physical strength would, of course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which, I have spoken. The remuneration will be twelve pounds a month, and you, would be required to take over your duties to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nI assure you that I have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as, to whence I have come from, whither I am going, or what I am here for., It is not for want of inquiry, or from indifference. I have mastered, the principles of several religions. They have all shocked me by the, violence which I should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of, any one of them. Their ethics are usually excellent. So are the ethics, of the common law of England. But the scheme of creation upon which, those ethics are built! Well, it really is to me the most astonishing, thing that I have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage, that so many, able men, deep philosophers, astute lawyers, and clear-headed men of, the world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life. In the, face of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not, dare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul, were it not that, I take courage when I reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and, philosophers of Rome and Greece were all agreed that Jupiter had, numerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine.\\n\\nThat was how, when I had gained some sort of opening, I set to work to, enlarge it. I joined this. I joined that. I pushed in every direction., I took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health, and found, that the practice benefited as well as I. My cricket form for the season, has been fair, with an average of about 20 with the bat and 9 with the, ball.\\n\\nThose whom I love best are those who have least sympathy with my, struggles. They talk about having faith, as if it could be done by an, act of volition. They might as well tell me to have black hair instead, of red. I might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all, in religious matters. But I will never be traitor to the highest thing, that God has given me. I WILL use it. It is more moral to use it and go, wrong, than to forego it and be right. It is only a little foot-rule\\n\\nBesides this decline in his practice, I was sorry to hear that, Cullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion, which had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits., His whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it, but as far, back as I can remember it had been a characteristic. Even in those, early days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocer's shop\\n\\nAgain, out of three shutters which belonged to the room, I rigged up a, very effective side-table for my own den, which when covered with a, red cloth, and ornamented with the bears' paws, might have cost twenty, guineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary. I had done, all this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow, which I shall have to tell you about, came upon me.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand me, and quote me as saying that it is a good thing, for a nation that it should have many drunkards. Nothing of the kind., What I say is, that if a nation has many morally weak people, then it, is good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains., Nature has her devices, and drink is among them. When there are no more, drunkards and reprobates, it means that the race is so advanced that it, no longer needs such rough treatment. Then the all-wise Engineer will, speed us along in some other fashion.\\n\\nWell, my dear Bertie, a happy and tranquil, if not very ambitious, existence stretches before us. We are both in our twenty-fifth year, and, I suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirty-five more, years lie in front of us. I can foresee the gradually increasing routine, of work, the wider circle of friends, the indentification with this or, that local movement, with perhaps a seat on the Bench, or at least, in the Municipal Council in my later years. It's not a very startling, programme, is it? But it lies to my hand, and I see no other. I should, dearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my, presence. Even on this small stage we have our two sides, and something, might be done by throwing all one's weight on the scale of breadth\\n\\nI am quite ashamed of having been so didactic. But it is fine to think, that sin may have an object and work towards good. My father says that, I seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property, and can't be, happy until I know that all is right with it. Well, it does send a, glow through me when I seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the, clouds.\\n\\n\\\"Well, he's been dead seven years, and fifty nets dipping into his, little fish-pond. However, when I passed I thought my best move was to, come down to the old place, and see whether I couldn't piece the thing, together again. The name ought to be worth something, I thought. But it, was no use doing the thing in a half hearted way. Not a bit of use in, that, Munro. The kind of people who came to him were wealthy, and must, see a fine house and a man in livery. What chance was there of gathering, them into a bow-windowed forty pound-a-year house with a grubby-faced, maid at the door? What do you suppose I did? My boy, I took the, governor's old house, that was unlet--the very house that he kept up at, five thousand a year. Off I started in rare style, and sank my last cent, in furniture. But it's no use, laddie. I can't hold on any longer. I, got two accidents and an epileptic--twenty-two pounds, eight and, sixpence--that's the lot!\\n\\nBut every movement has its crowd of camp followers, who straggle and, scatter. We are like a comet, bright at the head but tailing away into, mere gas behind. However, every man may speak for himself, and I do, not feel that your charge comes home to me. I am only bigoted against, bigotry, and that I hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent., When one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct, has had during the history of the world; the bitter wars, Christian and, Mahomedan, Catholic and Protestant; the persecutions, the torturings\\n\\nI had an adventure upon the way to Bradfield. The carriage in which, I was travelling contained a party of three, at whom I took the most, casual of glances before settling down to the daily paper. There was an, elderly lady, with a bright rosy face, gold spectacles, and a dash of, red velvet in her bonnet. With her were two younger people, who I took, to be her son and her daughter--the one a quiet, gentle-looking girl of, twenty or so, dressed in black, and the other a short, thick-set young, fellow, a year or two older. The two ladies sat by each other in the, far corner, and the son (as I presume him to be) sat opposite me. We may, have travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to, this little family party, save that I could not help hearing some talk, between the two ladies. The younger, who was addressed as Winnie, had\\n\\nThat was the first of my morning incidents. My second followed hard upon, the heels of it. Another ring came, and from my post of observation I, saw that a gipsy's van, hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs, had, drawn up at the door. Two or three people appeared to be standing, outside. I understood that they wished me to purchase some of their, wares, so I merely opened the door about three inches, said \\\"No, thank, you,\\\" and closed it. They seemed not to have heard me for they rang, again, upon which I opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly., Imagine my surprise when they rang again. I flung the door open, and was, about to ask them what they meant by their impudence, when one of the, little group upon my doorstep said, \\\"If you please, sir, it's the baby.\\\", Never was there such a change--from the outraged householder to the, professional man. \\\"Pray step in, madam,\\\" said I, in quite my most, courtly style; and in they all came--the husband, the brother, the wife, and the baby. The latter was in the early stage of measles. They were, poor outcast sort of people, and seemed not to have sixpence among them;, so my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in, my giving the medicine for nothing, and finally adding fivepence in, coppers, which was all the small change I had. A few more such patients, and I am a broken man.\\n\\nwith ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me, left, so jauntily by the tax-collector, and meaning such a dead-weight pull to, me. The irony of my paying a poor-rate used to amuse me. I should have, been collecting it. Thrice at a crisis I pawned my watch, and thrice I, rallied and rescued it. But how am I to interest you in the details of, such a career? Now, if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on, a piece of orange peel before my door, or if the chief merchant in the, town had been saved by some tour-de-force upon my part, or if I had, been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely, house with a princely fee for silence--then I should have something, worthy of your attention. But the long months and months during which, I listened to the throb of the charwoman's heart and the rustle of the, greengrocer's lungs, present little which is not dull and dreary. No, good angels came my way.\\n\\nMy chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke, and I assure you that, I was within an ace of going over. Down like a pack of cards came all my, dreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to, Avonmouth. Yes, Bertie, I am bound to confess it: my first thought was, of my own disappointment, and my second of the misfortune of my friends., He had the most diabolical intuitions, or I a very tell-tale face, for, he added at once--\\n\\n\\\"What is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound.\\\" He shoots off, a whole column of aphorisms in a single evening. I should like to have, a man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste. No; you, must not let me give you a false impression of the man's capacity., On the other hand, it would be dishonest to deny that I think him, thoroughly unscrupulous, and full of very sinister traits. I am much, mistaken, however, if he has not fine strata in his nature. He is, capable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths.\\n\\nWell, as I said, my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down, into the bulb, when on looking through the gathering gloom I saw, \\\"Merton\\\" printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station. I got out, and, was standing beside my trunk and my hat-box, waiting for a porter, when, up came a cheery-looking fellow and asked me whether I was Dr. Stark, Munro. \\\"I'm Horton,\\\" said he; and shook hands cordially.\\n\\n, My dear old chap, things have been happening, and I must tell you all, about it. Sympathy is a strange thing; for though I never see you, the, mere fact that you over there in New England are keenly interested in, what I am doing and thinking, makes my own life in old England very much, more interesting to me. The thought of you is like a good staff in my, right hand.\\n\\nAnd now I have worked my way to the point where I can show you what I, mean when I talk about fate. The medical practitioner who lives next, me--Porter is his name--is a kindly sort of man, and knowing that I have, had a long uphill fight, he has several times put things in my way., One day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after, breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"There you are!\\\" he would suddenly yell; \\\"see that man with a limp!, Every morning he goes. Displaced semilunar cartilage, and a three, months' job. The man's worth thirty-five shillings a week. And there!, I'm hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isn't round in, her bath-chair again. She's all sealskin and lactic acid. It's simply, sickening to see how they crowd to that man. And such a man! You haven't, seen him. All the better for you. I don't know what the devil you are, laughing at, Munro. I can't see where the fun comes in myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you frankly, old chap,\\\" said he, putting on suddenly that, sort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a, sneer in it. \\\"You see, many of my patients are simple country folk, half, imbecile for the most part, but then the half-crown of an imbecile is, as good as any other half-crown. They come to my door, and they see two, names, and their silly jaws begin to drop, and they say to each other\\n\\nHave you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts? We had one, in Cullingworth's practice just before his illness, and we were both, much excited about it. They seem to me to be one of those wee little, chinks through which one may see deep into Nature's workings. In this, case the fellow, who was a clerk in the post office, came to us with a, swelling over his eyebrow. We opened it under the impression that it was, an abscess, and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth, in it. You know that such cases are common enough in surgery, and that, no pathological museum is without an example.\\n\\nYes, Horton is a real right-down good fellow. His heart is broad and, kind and generous. There is nothing petty in the man. He loves to see, those around him happy; and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red, face goes far to make them so. Nature meant him to be a healer; for he, brightens up a sick room as he did the Merton station when first I set, eyes upon him. Don't imagine from my description that he is in any, way soft, however. There is no one on whom one could be less likely to, impose. He has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased., A mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into, the surgery like a whiff of cast wind, his checks red, his whiskers, bristling, and his eyes malignant. The daybook is banged, the bottles, rattled, the counter thumped, and then he is off again with five doors, slamming behind him. We can trace his progress when the black mood is on, him by those dwindling slams. Perhaps it is that McCarthy has labelled, the cough mixture as the eye-wash, or sent an empty pillbox with an, exhortation to take one every four hours. In any case the cyclone comes, and goes, and by the next meal all is peace once more.\\n\\nThis is all a digression, however, from the fact that I have been six, months at home and am weary of it, and pleased at the new development, of which I shall have to tell you. The practice here, although, unremunerative, is very busy with its three-and-sixpenny visits and, guinea confinements, so that both the governor and I have had plenty, to do. You know how I admire him, and yet I fear there is little, intellectual sympathy between us. He appears to think that those, opinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my, inmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado. So, I have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him, and, though we affect, to ignore it, we both know that there is a barrier there. Now, with my, mother--ah, but my mother must have a paragraph to herself.\\n\\nThe inside of the house was even huger than I had thought from the look, of the exterior. There were over thirty bedrooms, Cullingworth informed, me, as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs. The hall and first, stair were most excellently furnished and carpetted, but it all run, to nothing at the landing. My own bedroom had a little iron bed, and a, small basin standing on a packing case. Cullingworth took a hammer from, the mantelpiece, and began to knock in nails behind the door.\\n\\nShortly afterwards Jack went away to sea again; and after his departure, there were several furious quarrels between the women down below, which, filled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees. At last one, evening Miss Williams--the quiet one--came to me and announced with sobs, that she must go. Mrs. Wotton made her life unbearable, she said. She, was determined to be independent, and had fitted up a small shop in a, poor quarter of the town. She was going now, at once, to take possession, of it.\\n\\nAnd with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an, elemental religion. Come what may after death, our duties lie clearly, defined before us in this life; and the ethical standard of all creeds, agrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion, as to that. The last reformation simplified Catholicism. The coming one, will simplify Protestantism. And when the world is ripe for it another, will come and simplify that. The ever improving brain will give us an, ever broadening creed. Is it not glorious to think that evolution, is still living and acting--that if we have an anthropoid ape as an, ancestor, we may have archangels for our posterity?\\n\\n\\\"You believe far too much what James says,\\\" said she. \\\"You don't know, him in the least, Mr. Munro. You don't look at a thing from his point, of view, and you will never understand him until you do. It is not, of, course, that he means to say anything that is untrue; but his fancy is, excited, and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea, whether, it tells against himself or not. It hurts me, Mr. Munro, to see the, only man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship\\n\\nYou see by the address of this letter that I still hold my ground, but, between ourselves it has been a terrible fight, and there have been, times when that last plank of which old Whitehall wrote seemed to be, slipping out of my clutch. I have ebbed and flowed, sometimes with a, little money, sometimes without. At my best I was living hard, at my, worst I was very close upon starvation. I have lived for a whole day, upon the crust of a loaf, when I had ten pounds in silver in the drawer, of my table. But those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped, together for my quarter's rent, and I would have tried twenty-four hours, with a tight leather belt before I would have broken in upon it. For two, days I could not raise a stamp to send a letter. I have smiled when I, have read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in Egypt., Their broken victuals would have been a banquet to me. However, what, odds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen, as long as you DO, get it? The garrison of Oakley Villa has passed the worst, and there is, no talk of surrender.\\n\\nbeginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer, than friendship. You squeeze the slender arm which is passed through, yours, you venture to take the little gloved hand, you say good night, at absurd length in the shadow of the door. It is innocent and very, interesting, love trying his wings in a first little flutter. He will, keep his sustained flight later on, the better for the practice. There, was never any question of engagements between us, nor any suggestion of, harm. She knew that I was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects\\n\\n\\\"Because I know better. My boy, I'm a doctor's son, and I've seen too, much of it. I was born inside the machine, and I've seen all the wires., All this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of, the older men. It's to hold the young men back, and to stop the holes by, which they might slip through to the front. I've heard my father say so, a score of times. He had the largest practice in Scotland, and yet he, was absolutely devoid of brains. He slipped into it through seniority, and decorum. No pushing, but take your turn. Very well, laddie, when, you're at the top of the line, but how about it when you've just taken, your place at the tail? When I'm on the top rung I shall look down and, say, 'Now, you youngsters, we are going to have very strict etiquette\\n\\nand I had always defended him; but I was forced now to confess that she, had been right from the beginning. I said enough to show him that I, saw through his whole plot; and I wound up by assuring him that if he, thought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake; for I had, every reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the, very opening which I had most desired myself.\\n\\nand now I find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen;, so I am moving in the right direction. Of course, it compares absurdly, enough with Cullingworth's twenty pound a day, and my little quiet, back-water seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for, ever through his room. Still, I am quite satisfied, and I have no doubt, at all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first, year will be amply justified. It would be a pleasant thing to think that, if anything were really to happen at home, I should be able to be of, some use to them. If things go on as they have begun, I shall soon have, my feet firmly planted.\\n\\nThen I proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of, exploration. There were two upon the ground floor, sixteen feet square, each, and I saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair, condition. The front one would make a consulting room, the other a, waiting room, though I did not care to reflect who was most likely to do, the waiting. I was in the highest spirits, and did a step dance in each, room as an official inauguration.\\n\\nYou'll find my physiology even worse than my theology, Bertie. I have, a way of telling stories backwards to you, which is natural enough when, you consider that I always sit down to write under the influence of the, last impressions which have come upon me. All this talk about the soul, and the brain arises simply from the fact that I have been spending the, last few weeks with a lunatic. And how it came about I will tell you as, clearly as I can.\\n\\nNow, you will think me rather prolix about this man; but, as it looks, as if his life might become entwined with mine, it is a subject of, immediate interest to me, and I am writing all this for the purpose, of reviving my own half-faded impressions, as well as in the hope of, amusing and interesting you. So I must just give you one or two other, points which may make his character more clear to you.\\n\\nI had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases. One, (which was of immense importance to me) was that of a grocer named, Haywood, who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop. I was, passing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid. You may believe, that I saw my chance, bustled in, treated the man, conciliated the wife\\n\\nand he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast. The cooking, was to be done at a neighbouring confectioner's. The landlady's son, was coming in to wait. I was sorry to see that Whitehall was already, slurring his words together, and had evidently been priming himself, heavily. He looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time, we should have. So-and-so could talk well, and the other man could sing, a song. He was so far gone by now, that I ventured (in the capacity of, medical adviser) to speak to him about it.\\n\\nI was to go back to my father's that day, but I had a couple of hours, with Cullingworth in his consulting room before I left. He was in his, best form, and full of a hundred fantastic schemes, by which I was to, help him. His great object was to get his name into the newspapers. That, was the basis of all success, according to his views. It seemed to, me that he was confounding cause with effect; but I did not argue the, point. I laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions, which poured from him. I was to lie senseless in the roadway, and to be, carried into him by a sympathising crowd, while the footman ran with a, paragraph to the newspapers. But there was the likelihood that the, crowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite. In various, disguises I was to feign fits at his very door, and so furnish fresh, copy for the local press. Then I was to die--absolutely to expire--and, all Scotland was to resound with how Dr. Cullingworth, of Avonmouth, had, resuscitated me. His ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of, the idea, and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his, thoughts by the flood of half-serious devices.\\n\\nI daresay you've quite come to the conclusion by this time that, Cullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study--a man in the, first stage of lunacy or general paralysis. You might not be so sure, about it if you were in close contact with him. He justifies his wildest, flights by what he does. It sounds grotesque when put down in black and, white; but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he, had said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth. Now we, see that he has done it. His possibilities are immense. He has such, huge energy at the back of his fertility of invention. I am afraid, on, thinking over all that I have written to you, that I may have given you, a false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents, in which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character, and, omitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a, chance. His conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is, full of pith and idea. \\\"The greatest monument ever erected to Napoleon, Buonaparte was the British National debt,\\\" said he yesterday. Again\\n\\nthen, is he? He does not lie in the features which are to express his, emotions, nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the, blind and deaf. Nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over, which nature hangs her veil of flesh. In none of these things lies the, essence of the man. And now what is left? An arched whitish putty-like, mass, some fifty odd ounces in weight, with a number of white filaments, hanging down from it, looking not unlike the medusae which float in our, summer seas. But these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force, to muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes. They may, themselves therefore be disregarded. Nor can we stop here in our, elimination. This central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on, all sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul. Suicides, have shot away the front lobes of the brain, and have lived to repent, it. Surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections. Much of it, is merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion, and much, for the reception of impressions. All this may be put aside as we search, for the physical seat of what we call the soul--the spiritual part of, the man. And what is left then? A little blob of matter, a handful of, nervous dough, a few ounces of tissue, but there--somewhere there--lurks, that impalpable seed, to which the rest of our frame is but the pod. The, old philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right\\n\\nThen, there is her family pride. That is a very vital portion of the, mother. You know how little I think of such things. If the Esquire were, to be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name I should be, the lighter for it. But, ma foi!--to use her own favourite expletive--it, would not do to say this to her. On the Packenham side (she is a, Packenham) the family can boast of some fairly good men--I mean on the, direct line--but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch, upon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree. Not once, nor, twice, but thrice did the Plantagenets intermarry with us, the Dukes, of Brittany courted our alliance, and the Percies of Northumberland, intertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record. So in my, boyhood she would expound the matter, with hearthbrush in one hand and, a glove full of cinders in the other, while I would sit swinging my, knickerbockered legs, swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as, tight as a sausage skin, as I contemplated the gulf which separated me, from all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables. To this, day if I chance to do anything of which she strongly approves, the dear, heart can say no more than that I am a thorough Packenham; while if I, fall away from the straight path, she says with a sigh that there are, points in which I take after the Munros.\\n\\nBut, my goodness, where have I got to? All this comes from the, Birchespool lamp-posts and curb-stones. And I sat down to write such a, practical letter too! However, I give you leave to be as dogmatic and, didactic as you like in return. Cullingworth says my head is like a, bursting capsule, with all the seeds getting loose. Poor seed, too, I, fear, but some of it may lodge somewhere--or not, as Fate pleases.\\n\\ntherefore, and conveyed him to his home, I sitting with my most, professional air, and he standing straight up between my hands. The, carriage went at a walk, and the crowd trailed behind, with all the folk, looking out of the windows, so that a more glorious advertisement could, not be conceived. It looked like the advance guard of a circus. Once at, his house, however, professional etiquette demanded that I should hand, the case over to the family attendant, which I did with as good a grace, as possible--not without some lingering hope that the old established, practitioner might say, \\\"You have taken such very good care of my, patient, Dr. Munro, that I should not dream of removing him from your, hands.\\\" On the contrary, he snatched it away from me with avidity, and I, retired with some credit, an excellent advertisement, and a guinea.\\n\\nFor the next three days I had not a single ring at the bell of any sort, whatever. A man could not be more isolated from his kind. It used to, amuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passers-by stopped to, look at my plate. Once (on a Sunday morning) there were over a hundred, in an hour, and often I could see from their glancing over their, shoulders as they walked on, that they were thinking or talking of the, new doctor.\\n\\nMedical men, according to his view, have been afraid of producing a, poisonous effect with their drugs. With him, on the contrary, the, whole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning, and when the case, is serious, his remedies are heroic. Where, in epilepsy, I should have, given thirty-grain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours, he, would give two drachms every three. No doubt it will seem to you very, kill-or-cure, and I am myself afraid that a succession of coroners', inquests may check Cullingworth's career; but hitherto he has had no, public scandal, while the cases which he has brought back to life have, been numerous. He is the most fearless fellow. I have seen him pour, opium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled. But either his, knowledge or his luck always brings him out right.\\n\\nOne curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me., She is a stately looking widow, Turner by name, the most depressingly, respectable figure, as of Mrs. Grundy's older and less frivolous sister., She lives in a tiny house, with one small servant to scale. Well, every, two months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink, which lasts for, about a week. It ends as abruptly as it begins, but while it is on the, neighbours know it. She shrieks, yells, sings, chivies the servant\\n\\nBut in all soberness, I really do think, Bertie, that very much which, seems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it, properly. I tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink, and immorality. But physically, I fancy that it applies more obviously, than it does morally. All the physical evils of life seem to culminate, in death; and yet death, as I have seen it, has not been a painful or, terrible process. In many cases, a man dies without having incurred, nearly as much pain, during the whole of his fatal illness, as would, have arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw. And it is often, those deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker, which are least, so to the sufferer. When a man is overtaken by an express and shivered, into fragments, or when he drops from a fourth-floor window and, is smashed into a bag of splinters, the unfortunate spectators are, convulsed with horror, and find a text for pessimistic views about the, Providence which allows such things to be. And yet, it is very doubtful, whether the deceased, could his tongue be loosened, would remember, anything at all about the matter. We know, as students of medicine\\n\\nI said that the patients were very homely. Any one who is over-starched, might well come here to be unstiffened. I confess that I did not quite, fall in with it at once. When on one of my first mornings a club patient, with his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if I were the, doctor's man, I sent him on to see the groom in the stable. But soon one, falls into the humour of it. There is no offence meant; and why should, any be taken? They are kindly, generous folk; and if they pay no respect, to your profession in the abstract, and so rather hurt your dignity\\n\\n'There's two of 'em here. It's Dr. Cullingworth we want to see, but if, we go in we'll be shown as likely as not to Dr. Munro.' So it ends in, some cases in their not coming at all. Then there are the women. Women, don't care a toss whether you are a Solomon, or whether you are hot from, an asylum. It's all personal with them. You fetch them, or you don't, fetch them. I know how to work them, but they won't come if they think, they are going to be turned over to anybody else. That's what I put the, falling away down to.\\\"\\n\\nand man's form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine, we, walked amid the pealings of the \\\"Wedding March\\\" into the vestry, where, my dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the, register in the wrong place, so that to all appearance it was she who, had just married the clergyman. And then amid congratulations and kindly, faces, we were together, her hand on my forearm, upon the steps of the, church, and saw the familiar road stretching before us. But it was, not that road which lay before my eyes, but rather the path of our, lives;--that broader path on which our feet were now planted, so, pleasant to tread, and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist. Was, it long, or was it short? Was it uphill, or was it down? For her, at, least, it should be smooth, if a man's love could make it so.\\n\\n\\\"When the maid was arranging your room after your departure, she cleared, some pieces of torn paper from under the grate. Seeing my name upon, them, she brought them, as in duty bound, to her mistress, who pasted, them together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to, you, in which I am referred to in the vilest terms, such as 'a bankrupt, swindler' and 'the unscrupulous Cullingworth.' I can only say that we, are astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence, while you were a guest under our roof, and we refuse to have anything, more to do with you in any shape or form.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly, qualified medical men. The Cullingworths vanished away, and I never, heard any more of them, for he was a man who prided himself upon never, writing a letter. His father had formerly a very large and lucrative, practice in the West of Scotland, but he died some years ago. I had a, vague idea, founded upon some chance remark of his, that Cullingworth, had gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good, stead there. As for me I began, as you will remember that I explained, in my last, by acting as assistant in my father's practice. You know\\n\\nIt is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the, views of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive, and will wait, resignedly for what fate may send him. The objector forgets that among, the other things fated is that we of northern blood SHOULD strive and, should NOT sit down with folded hands. But when a man has striven, when, he has done all he knows, and when, in spite of it, a thing comes to, pass, let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune. It, is part of the main line of his destiny then, and is working to an end., A man loses his fortune; he gains earnestness. His eyesight goes; it, leads him to a spirituality. The girl loses her beauty; she becomes more, sympathetic. We think we are pushing our own way bravely, but there is a, great Hand in ours all the time.\\n\\nThe man who claims that we can know nothing is, to my mind, as, unreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely, revealed to us. I know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type, of scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know, but has not, imagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of, doubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance., He is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws\\n\\nLook at it in this way. We know that many of the permanent facts of the, universe are NOT chance. It is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing, clear of each other, that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which, will drift it to a congenial soil, that the creature is adapted to its, environment. Show me a whale with its great-coat of fat, and I want no, further proof of design. But logically, as it seems to me, ALL must be, design, or all must be chance. I do not see how one can slash a line, right across the universe, and say that all to the right of that is, chance, and all to the left is pre-ordained. You would then have to, contend that things which on the face of them are of the same class, are, really divided by an impassable gulf, and that the lower are regulated\\n\\nI tell you these trivial matters, my dear Bertie, just to show you that, I am not down on my luck, and that my life is not pitched in the minor, key altogether, in spite of my queer situation. But, to turn to graver, things: I was right glad to get your letter, and to read all your, denunciations about dogmatic science. Don't imagine that my withers are, wrung by what you say, for I agree with almost every word of it.\\n\\nThe moment I looked him in the face I smelled mischief. He had a gleam, of settled malice in his eye. I believe it was my refusal to back his, paper which was running in his head. Anyway he looked as dangerous as he, could look, with his scowling face sunk forward a little, his hands, down near his hips (for his boxing, like everything else about him, is, unconventional), and his jaw set like a rat-trap.\\n\\nVery sober to outward seeming, but in a frenzy within, he went down to, the station one night, and, stooping to the pigeon-hole, he asked the, ticket-clerk, in the suavest voice, whether he could tell him how far, it was to London. The official put forward his face to reply when, Cullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a, piston. The clerk flew backwards off his stool, and his yell of pain and, indignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance., They pursued Cullingworth; but he, as active and as fit as a greyhound\\n\\nSo there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices, and wonderful introductions! I believe the only person in the whole, house who regretted me was Jimmy, who was quite downcast at the news., His grief, however, did not prevent him from brushing my new top-hat, the wrong way on the morning that I left. I did not notice it until I, reached the station, and a most undignified object I must have looked, when I took my departure.\\n\\nI ask myself, where is the man, the very, very inmost essence of the, man? See how much you may subtract from him without touching it. It does, not lie in the limbs which serve him as tools, nor in the apparatus by, which he is to digest, nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen. All, these are mere accessories, the slaves of the lord within. Where\\n\\ncataracts, iritis, refractions, what you like; here's the great Signor, Cullingworth, right up to date and ready for anything!' In they come of, course, droves of them, and then I arrive and take the money. Here's, my luggage!\\\" he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room., \\\"Those are glasses, my boy, concave and convex, hundreds of them. I test, an eye, fit him on the spot, and send him away shouting. Then I load, up a steamer and come home, unless I elect to buy one of their little, States and run it.\\\"\\n\\nYou will wonder, perhaps, how we get on--my wife and I--in the matter, of religion. Well, we both go our own ways. Why should I proselytise? I, would not for the sake of abstract truth take away her child-like faith, which serves to make life easier and brighter to her. I have made myself, ill-understood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in, them any bitterness against the orthodox creeds. Far from saying that, they are all false, it would express my position better to say that they, are all true. Providence would not have used them were they not the best, available tools, and in that sense divine. That they are final I deny. A, simpler and more universal creed will take their place, when the mind of, man is ready for it; and I believe it will be a creed founded upon those, lines of absolute and provable truth which I have indicated. But the old, creeds are still the best suited to certain minds, and to certain ages., If they are good enough for Providence to use, they are good enough for, us to endure. We have but to wait upon the survival of the truest. If I, have seemed to say anything aggressive against them, it was directed, at those who wish to limit the Almighty's favour to their own little, clique, or who wish to build a Chinese wall round religion, with no, assimilation of fresh truths, and no hope of expansion in the future. It, is with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce. As for my, wife, I would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers, as, she would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table., She is not narrow in her views; but if one could stand upon the very, topmost pinnacle of broad-mindedness, one would doubtless see from it, that even the narrow have their mission.\\n\\nonly I may have been a little more emphatic. \\\"Pain in the jaw,\\\" said he., \\\"You needn't make such a noise,\\\" said I; \\\"other people are ill besides, you.\\\" \\\"If I pay my money, young man, I'll make such noise as I like.\\\", And actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door., He would have gone on with his devil's tattoo all morning if I had not, led him down the path and seen him off the premises. An hour afterwards, Horton whirled into the surgery, with a trail of banged doors behind, him. \\\"What's this about Mr. Usher, Munro?\\\" he asked. \\\"He says that you, were violent towards him.\\\" \\\"There was a club patient here who kept on, banging the knocker,\\\" said I; \\\"I was afraid that he would disturb Mrs., White, and so I made him stop.\\\" Horton's eyes began to twinkle. \\\"My, boy,\\\" said he, \\\"that club patient, as you call him, is the richest man, in Merton, and worth a hundred a year to me.\\\" I have no doubt that he, appeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation; but I have not, heard anything of the matter since.\\n\\nthat there was no getting away from him. He was on me once more with, a regular football rush that knocked me off my balance. Before I knew, where I was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear. I, tripped over a footstool, and then before I could get my balance he had, me on the same ear again, and my head was singing like a tea-kettle., He was as pleased as possible with himself, blowing out his chest and, slapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the, room.\\n\\n\\\"By God, Dr. Munro, sir, I'm the man that's going to stick to you. I'm, only an old sailor-man, sir, with perhaps more liquor than sense; but, I'm the Queen's servant, and touch my pension every quarter day. I, don't claim to be R. N., but I'm not merchant service either. Here I, am, rotting in lodgings, but by ----, Dr. Munro, sir, I carried seven, thousand stinking Turks from Varna to Balaclava Bay. I'm with you, Dr., Munro, and we put this thing through together.\\\"\\n\\nwhen only a senior midshipman, lost the sight of one eye and the use of, one arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable Pah in, the Maori war. The other was a sad-faced poetical-looking man, of, good birth as I understood, who had been disowned by his family on the, occasion of his eloping with the cook. His name was Carr, and his chief, peculiarity, that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could, always tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in., He would cock his head, think over his own symptoms, and then give, you the hour fairly correctly. An unusual drink would disarrange him\\n\\nI led off, and then in he came hitting with both hands, and grunting, like a pig at every blow. From what I could see of him he was no boxer, at all, but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter. I was guarding, with both hands for half a minute, and then was rushed clean off my legs, and banged up against the door, with my head nearly through one of the, panels. He wouldn't stop then, though he saw that I had no space to get, my elbows back; and he let fly a right-hander which would have put me, into the hall, if I hadn't slipped it and got back to the middle of the, room.\\n\\nFred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time. I, gave him his usual dose last thing at night; and then, as he seemed to, be sleeping peacefully, I went to my own room for the rest which I badly, needed. I did not wake until eight in the morning, when I was roused, by the jingling of a spoon in a saucer, and the step of Miss Williams, passing my door. She was taking him the arrowroot which I had ordered, over-night. I heard her open the door, and the next moment my heart, sprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream, and her cup and saucer, crashed upon the floor. An instant later she had burst into my room\\n\\nand all these bodies for? Eh, laddie? For encouraging the best interests, of the profession. Do you suppose they do that by making the, population healthy? It's about time we had a mutiny among the general, practitioners. If I had the use of half the funds which the Association, has, I should spend part of them in drain-blocking, and the rest in the, cultivation of disease germs, and the contamination of drinking water.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we came down to the dining-room for supper, Mrs. Cullingworth was, waiting there to greet me. I was sorry to see that she was pale and, weary-looking. However, we had a merry meal in the old style, and her, husband's animation reflected itself upon her face, until at last we, might have been back in the little room, where the Medical Journals, served as a chair, instead of in the great oak-furnished, picture-hung, chamber to which we had been promoted. All the time, however, not one, word as to the object of my journey.\\n\\nWhen I came back I settled down once more to the routine of my father's, practice, holding on there until something may turn up. And for six, months I have had to wait; a weary six months they have been. You see I, cannot ask my father for money--or, at least, I cannot bring myself to, take an unnecessary penny of his money--for I know how hard a fight, it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest, little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose, is to a tailor. Foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of, guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury! We can just hold, on, and I would not have him a pound the poorer for me. But you can, understand, Bertie, that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have, to go about without any money in my pocket. It affects me in so many, petty ways. A poor man may do me a kindness, and I have to seem mean in, his eyes. I may want a flower for a girl, and must be content to appear, ungallant. I don't know why I should be ashamed of this, since it is no, fault of mine, and I hope that I don't show it to any one else that I AM, ashamed of it; but to you, my dear Bertie, I don't mind confessing that, it hurts my self-respect terribly.\\n\\nAfter this bit of bravado I felt better, and I thought over the, situation. I was alone in a strange town, without connections, without, introductions, with less than a pound in my pocket, and with no, possibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities. I had no one at, all to look to for help, for all my recent letters from home had given a, dreary account of the state of things there. My poor father's health and, his income were dwindling together. On the other hand, I reflected that, there were some points in my favour. I was young. I was energetic. I had, been brought up hard, and was quite prepared to rough it. I was well up, in my work, and believed I could get on with patients. My house was an, excellent one for my purpose, and I had already put the essentials of, furniture into it. The game was not played out yet. I jumped to my feet, and clenched my hand, and swore to the chandelier that it never should, be played out until I had to beckon for help from the window.\\n\\nRound he came, and very helpful he was. He seemed to know all about the, procedure--\\\"Buried two wives, Dr. Munro, sir!\\\" I signed the certificate, myself, conveyed it to the registrar, got the order for burial, took, it round to the parish clerk, arranged an hour, then off to the, undertaker's, and back to my practice. It was a kind of nightmare, morning to look back upon, relieved only by the figure of my old, Bohemian, with his pea jacket, his black thorn, his puffy, crinkly face\\n\\nthat he should not say one word about his phenomenal success here--of, which I am naturally most anxious to hear--not a word either upon the, important subject of our partnership, but will think and talk of nothing, but this extraordinary naval idea. In a week he will have tossed it, aside in all probability, and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the, Jews and settling them in Madagascar. Yet from all he has said, and all, I have seen, there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way, made a tremendous hit, and to-morrow I shall let you know all about, it. Come what may, I am delighted that I came, for things promise to be, interesting. Regard this not as the end of a letter, but of a paragraph., You shall have the conclusion to-morrow, or on Thursday at the latest., Goodbye, and my remembrance to Lawrence if you see him. How's your, friend from Yale?\\n\\nOne day we went to the Central Hotel billiard-room in the evening to, play a match. Our form is just about the same, and we should have bad an, enjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his. He had, been in a sullen humour the whole day, pretending not to hear what, I said to him, or else giving snappy answers, and looking like a, thunder-cloud. I was determined not to have a row, so I took no notice, at all of his continual provocations, which, instead of pacifying him\\n\\nI think that I mentioned, when I gave you a short sketch of my dear old, mother, that she has a very high standard of family honour. She really, tries to live up to the Percy-Plantagenet blend which is said to flow, in our veins; and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her, from sailing through life, like the grande dame that she is, throwing, largesse to right and left, with her head in the air and her soul in the, clouds. I have often heard her say (and I am quite convinced that she, meant it) that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves, than know that we had committed a dishonourable action. Yes; for all her, softness and femininity, she could freeze iron-hard at the suspicion of, baseness; and I have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace, collar when she has heard of an act of meanness.\\n\\nThere was no need of three insertions. One would have been ample. Within, half an hour of the appearance of the first edition, I had an applicant, at the end of my bell-wire, and for the remainder of the evening Paul, was ushering them in and I interviewing them with hardly a break. I, should have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat;, but as we saw the demand increase, our conditions went up and up;, white aprons, proper dress for answering door, doing beds and boots\\n\\nHowever, I had not quite got to the end of Whitehall's visit yet. When, I went back I took down the beautiful lava jug, and inside I found his, card. On the back was written, \\\"You have gone into action, sir. It may, be your fate to sink or to swim, but it can never be your degradation, to strike. Die on the last plank and be damned to you, or come into port, with your ensign flying mast-high.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you this, Bertie, because if I put reason above emotion I would, not have you think that I am not open to attacks of the latter also., I feel that what I say about religion is too cold and academic. I feel, that there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting., But if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a, thing to be true, which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out, against, then you are selling your opiates too high. I'm a volunteer for, \\\"God's own forlorn hope,\\\" and I'll clamber up the breech as long as I, think I can see the flag of truth waving in front of me.\\n\\nthe man whom they were after, running at the top of his speed in their, direction. His little peculiarity had asserted itself, you see, and, he had unconsciously turned in his flight. They tripped him up, flung, themselves upon him, and after a long and desperate struggle dragged, him to the police station. He was charged before the magistrate next, morning, but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own, defence that he carried the Court with him, and escaped with a nominal, fine. At his invitation, the witnesses and the police trooped after, him to the nearest hotel, and the affair ended in universal, whisky-and-sodas.\\n\\na sitting-room, and a fourth room, which Cullingworth insisted upon, regarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease, though, I am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from, below which had given him the idea. At any rate, with his usual energy, he had not only locked the room up, but had gummed varnished paper over, all the cracks of the door, to prevent the imaginary contagion from, spreading. The furniture was the sparest possible. There were, I, remember, only two chairs in the sitting-room; so that when a guest came, (and I think I was the only one) Cullingworth used to squat upon a pile, of yearly volumes of the British Medical Journal in the corner. I can, see him now levering himself up from his lowly seat, and striding about, the room roaring and striking with his hands, while his little wife, sat mum in the corner, listening to him with love and admiration in her, eyes. What did we care, any one of the three of us, where we sat or how, we lived, when youth throbbed hot in our veins, and our souls were all, aflame with the possibilities of life? I still look upon those Bohemian, evenings, in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese, as being among, the happiest that I have known.\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to have any doctoring it must come from you, laddie,\\\" he said;, \\\"for if I was to turn my toes up in the public square, there's not a man, here who would do more than sign my certificate. By Crums, they might, get the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me, for, there's no love lost between us. But I want to go down to the practice, all the same.\\\"\\n\\nYou see, it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first, appearance in Birchespool was not in the dock of the police-court. I, should have had no one to answer for me, if I had been arrested, and, should have been put quite on a level with my adversary. I daresay you, think I made a great fool of myself, but I should like to know how, I could have acted otherwise. The only thing that I feel now is my, loneliness. What a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child!\\n\\nI was a frequent visitor to the Cullingworths, for the pleasure that I, got was made the sweeter by the pleasure which I hoped that I gave. They, knew no one, and desired to know no one; so that socially I seemed to be, the only link that bound them to the world. I even ventured to interfere, in the details of their little menage. Cullingworth had a fad at the, time, that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment, of the open-air life of our ancestors, and as a corollary he kept his, windows open day and night. As his wife was obviously fragile, and yet, would have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint, I, took it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she, suffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a, draught. He scowled savagely at me for my interference; and I thought, we were on the verge of a quarrel, but it blew over, and he became more, considerate in the matter of ventilation.\\n\\n, You write reproachfully, my dear Bertie, and you say that absence must, have weakened our close friendship, since I have not sent you a line, during this long seven months. The real truth of the matter is that, I had not the heart to write to you until I could tell you something, cheery; and something cheery has been terribly long in coming. At, present I can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at, the edges.\\n\\ntogether with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among, the ancient Londoners. Several examples of these metallic cylinders, or tubings were on exhibition in the hall, and were passed round for, inspection among the audience. The learned lecturer prefaced his remarks, by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which, separated them from the days when London was a flourishing city, it, behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might, come as to the habits of the inhabitants. Recent research appeared to, have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall, of London was somewhat later than that of the erection of the Egyptian, Pyramids. A large building had recently been unearthed near the dried-up, bed of the river Thames; and there could be no question from existing, records that this was the seat of the law-making council among the, ancient Britons--or Anglicans, as they were sometimes called. The, lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the Thames had been, tunnelled under by a monarch named Brunel, who is supposed by some, authorities to have succeeded Alfred the Great. The open spaces of, London, he went on to remark, must have been far from safe, as the, bones of lions, tigers, and other extinct forms of carnivora had, been discovered in the Regent's Park. Having briefly referred to the, mysterious structures known as 'pillar-boxes,' which are scattered, thickly over the city, and which are either religious in their origin\\n\\nAfter all, I see more and more clearly that both men and women are, incomplete, fragmentary, mutilated creatures, as long as they are, single. Do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is, the happiest, they are still full of vague unrests, of dim, ill-defined, dissatisfactions, of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts., Alone each is a half-made being, with every instinct and feeling, yearning for its missing moiety. Together they form a complete and, symmetrical whole, the minds of each strongest where that of the other, needs reinforcing. I often think that if our souls survive death (and I, believe they do, though I base my believe on very different grounds from, yours), every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined, with it, to round it off and give it symmetry. So thought the old, Mormon, you remember, who used it as an argument for his creed. \\\"You, cannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you,\\\" he said., \\\"But with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the, world to come.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that I must, tell you of it. Cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel, darts. With this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet, the, length of the back room. We were shooting at a mark after dinner, when, he asked me whether I would hold a halfpenny between my finger and, thumb, and allow him to shoot it out. A halfpenny not being forthcoming\\n\\nits dogmatism about what seems to be false, its conflict with what we, know to be true. We KNOW that man has ascended, not descended; so what, is the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition, of his fall? We KNOW that the world was not made in six days, that the, sun could never be stopped since it was never moving, and that no man, ever lived three days in a fish; so what becomes of the inspiration of a, book which contains such statements? \\\"Truth, though it crush me!\\\"\\n\\nThe room was a large bare one, at the end of a long corridor. Near the, door was seated a footman, placed there to fill up the gap between two, doctors, and looking considerably relieved at my advent. Over by the, window (which was furnished with a wooden guard, like that of a nursery), sat a tall, yellow-haired, yellow-bearded, young man, who raised a pair, of startled blue eyes as we entered. He was turning over the pages of a, bound copy of the Illustrated London News.\\n\\nI had enough to make a man serious before, when I had to face the world, without money or interest. But now to think of the mother and my sisters, and little Paul all leaning upon me when I cannot stand myself--it is, a nightmare. Could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have, those whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it?, But perhaps it won't come to that. Perhaps my father may hold his, own for years. Come what may, I am bound to think that all things are, ordered for the best; though when the good is a furlong off, and we with, our beetle eyes can only see three inches, it takes some confidence in, general principles to pull us through.\\n\\n\\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo Player,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle,\\\" for five shillings;, a tiny fender, half-a-crown; a toilet set, five shillings; another, very small square-topped table, three and sixpence. Whenever I bid, for anything, Whitehall thrust his black-thorn up into the air, and, presently I found him doing so on my behalf when I had no intention of, buying. I narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a, stuffed macaw in a glass case.\\n\\nIt was about four in the afternoon when I reached Birchespool, which, is fifty-three miles by rail from Bradfield. It may be merely a name to, you, and, indeed, until I set foot in it I knew nothing of it myself;, but I can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and, thirty thousand souls (about the same as Bradfield), that it is mildly, manufacturing, that it is within an hour's journey of the sea, that it, has an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well, and that the, country round is exceedingly beautiful. It is small enough to have a, character of its own, and large enough for solitude, which is always the, great charm of a city, after the offensive publicity of the country.\\n\\nThis was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd. The folk, behind, wishing to see all that was going on, pushed against those in, front, until half-a-dozen of the foremost (with, I think, a woman among, them) were flung right up against us. One of these, a rough, sailor-like, fellow in a jersey, got wedged between us; and my antagonist, in his, blind rage, got one of his swinging blows home upon this new-comer's, ear. \\\"What, you----!\\\" yelled the sailor; and in an instant he had taken, over the whole contract, and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty., I grabbed my stick, which had fallen among the crowd, and backed my way, out, rather dishevelled, but very glad to get off so cheaply. From the, shouting which I could hear some time after I reached the door of my, lodgings, I gathered that a good battle was still raging.\\n\\nwe won't leave a doctor in it. It's all they can do now to get butter, to their bread; and when we get to work together they'll have to eat it, dry. Listen to me, my boy! There are a hundred and twenty thousand folk, in this town, all shrieking for advice, and there isn't a doctor who, knows a rhubarb pill from a calculus. Man, we only have to gather them, in. I stand and take the money until my arm aches.\\\"\\n\\nWell, when I had finished my empty-house-and-doctor chart, I found that, there was one villa to let, which undoubtedly was far the most suitable, for my purpose. In the first place it was fairly cheap-forty pounds, or, fifty with taxes. The front looked well. It had no garden. It stood with, the well-to-do quarter upon the one side, and the poorer upon the other., Finally, it was almost at the intersection of four roads, one of which, was a main artery of the town. Altogether, if I had ordered a house for, my purpose I could hardly have got anything better, and I was thrilled, with apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent. I, hurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather, startled the demure clerk inside.\\n\\nMy father took the news philosophically enough, with some rather, sardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep, each other company. But to my mother it was a flash of joy, followed by, a thunderclap of consternation. I had only three under-shirts, the, best of my linen had gone to Belfast to be refronted and recuffed, the, night-gowns were not marked yet--there were a dozen of those domestic, difficulties of which the mere male never thinks. A dreadful vision of, Lady Saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of, my socks obsessed my mother. Out we trudged together, and before evening, her soul was at rest, and I had mortgaged in advance my first month's, salary. She was great, as we walked home, upon the grand people into, whose service I was to enter. \\\"As a matter of fact, my dear,\\\" said she\\n\\nWe used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors; and, there we made a curious quartette: Jimmy (as he wished me to call him), glum and silent; I with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him;, Lady Saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins; and the, good-natured peer, fussy and genial, but always rather subdued in the, presence of his wife. She looked as if a glass of good wine would do, her good, and he as if he would be the better for abstinence; and so, in, accordance with the usual lopsidedness of life, he drank freely, and, she took nothing but lime-juice and water. You cannot imagine a more, ignorant, intolerant, narrow-minded woman than she. If she had only been, content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers, it would, not have mattered; but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating, clacking. What was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease, from one generation to another? She was bounded by insanity upon the, north and upon the south. I resolutely set myself to avoid all argument, with her; but she knew, with her woman's instinct, that we were as far, apart as the poles, and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before, me. One day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an, Episcopal church performing any service in a Presbyterian chapel. Some, neighbouring minister had done it, it seems; and if he had been marked, down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing., I suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue, for she, suddenly turned upon me with:\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, holding out a twitching hand., \\\"I compliment you, sir! You look fresh, ---- fresh, and me with a head, like a toy-shop. We had a pleasant, quiet evening, and I took nothing to, hurt, but it is the ---- relaxing air of this place that settles me. I, can't bear up against it. Last year it gave me the horrors, and I expect, it will again. You're off house-hunting, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\nand calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as, to his position. The good people were so touched by the picture that, he drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them, wept, and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their, bills stand over, but even some talk of a collection then and there to, help Cullingworth on his way. He has, I understand, left Avonmouth, but, no one has any idea what has become of him. It is generally supposed, that he has gone to England. He is a strange fellow, but I wish him luck, wherever he goes.\\n\\nI never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life. He used, language of self-reproach which would have been extravagant if he had, shot off one of my limbs. Our positions were absurdly reversed; and it, was he who sat collapsed in a chair, while it was I, with the dart, still in my finger, who leaned over him and laughed the matter off. Mrs., Cullingworth had run for hot water, and presently with a tweezers we, got the intruder out. There was very little pain (more to-day than, yesterday), but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may, look for a star at the end of my right forefinger.\\n\\nAnd then there came another and a more serious accident. This would be, about two months after the beginning, though already I find it hard to, put things in their due order. A lawyer in the town named Dickson was, riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him. I was, eating saveloys in the back room at the time, but I heard the noise and, rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in., They flooded into my house, thronged my hall, dirtied my consulting, room, and even pushed their way into my back room, which they found, elegantly furnished with a portmanteau, a lump of bread, and a cold, sausage.\\n\\nI had plenty of time on my way to Birchespool to reflect upon my, prospects and present situation. My baggage consisted of a large, brassplate, a small leather trunk, and a hat-box. The plate with my name, engraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head. In my box, were a stethoscope, several medical books, a second pair of boots, two, suits of clothes, my linen and my toilet things. With this, and the five, pounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse, I was sallying out, to clear standing-room, and win the right to live from my fellow-men., But at least there was some chance of permanency about this; and if, there was the promise of poverty and hardship, there was also that of, freedom. I should have no Lady Saltire to toss up her chin because I had, my own view of things, no Cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing. I, would be my own--my very own. I capered up and down the carriage at the, thought. After all, I had everything to gain and nothing in the whole, wide world to lose. And I had youth and strength and energy, and the, whole science of medicine packed in between my two ears. I felt as, exultant as though I were going to take over some practice which lay, ready for me.\\n\\nThe Cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return. There was, a singular look upon both their faces which seemed to ME to mean that, they were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me. When I think, of their absolute geniality a few days ago, and their markedly reserved, manner now, I can make no sense out of it. I asked Cullingworth point, blank what it meant, but he only turned it off with a forced laugh, and, some nonsense about my thin skin. I think that I am the last man in the, world to take offence where none is meant; but at any rate I determined, to end the matter by leaving Bradfield at once. It had struck me, during, my journey back from Stockwell, that Birchespool would be a good place;, so on the very next day I started off, taking my luggage with me, and, bidding a final good-bye to Cullingworth and his wife.\\n\\nWe were away for several weeks in the Isle of Man, and then came back, to Oakley Villa, where Miss Williams was awaiting us in a house in which, even my mother could have found no dust, and with a series of cheering, legends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my, absence. There really was a marked increase in my practice; and for the, last six months or so, without being actually busy, I have always had, enough to occupy me. My people are poor, and I have to work hard for a, small fee; but I still study and attend the local hospital, and keep my, knowledge up-to-date, so as to be ready for my opening when it comes., There are times when I chafe that I may not play a part upon some, larger stage than this; but my happiness is complete, and if fate has, no further use for me, I am content now from my heart to live and to die, where I am.\\n\\nTalking about horses, we had no end of a fuss here the other day., Cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a first-class riding, horse; and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him, he, commissioned a horse dealer to get him one. The man told us of a charger, which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of. He, did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was, because he considered it to be dangerous; but, he added, that Captain, Lucas had given L150 for it, and was prepared to sell it at seventy., This excited Cullingworth, and he ordered the creature to be saddled and, brought round. It was a beautiful animal, coal black, with a magnificent, neck and shoulders, but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears, and an, unpleasant way of looking at you. The horse dealer said that our yard, was too small to try the creature in; but Cullingworth clambered up upon, its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the, ears with the bone handle of his whip. Then ensued one of the most, lively ten minutes that I can remember. The beast justified his, reputation; but Cullingworth, although he was no horseman, stuck to him, like a limpet. Backwards, forwards, sideways, on his fore feet, on, his hind feet, with his back curved, with his back sunk, bucking and, kicking, there was nothing the creature did not try. Cullingworth was, sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail--never by, any chance in the saddle--he had lost both stirrups, and his knees were, drawn up and his heels dug into the creature's ribs, while his hands, clawed at mane, saddle, or ears, whichever he saw in front of him. He, kept his whip, however; and whenever the brute eased down, Cullingworth, lammed him once more with the bone handle. His idea, I suppose, was to, break its spirit, but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry, through. The animal bunched his four feet together, ducked down his, head, arched his back like a yawning cat, and gave three convulsive, springs into the air. At the first, Cullingworth's knees were above the, saddle flaps, at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive, grip, at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling, narrowly, missed the coping of the wall, broke with his head the iron bar which, held some wire netting, and toppled back with a thud into the yard. Up, he bounded with the blood streaming down his face, and running into our, half-finished stables he seized a hatchet, and with a bellow of, rage rushed at the horse. I caught him by the coat and put on a, fourteen-stone drag, while the horse dealer (who was as white as a, cheese) ran off with his horse into the street. Cullingworth broke away, from my grip, and cursing incoherently, his face slobbered with blood\\n\\nBut how do I know what is truth, you ask? I don't. But I know, particularly well what isn't. And surely that is something to have, gained. It isn't true that the great central Mind that planned all, things is capable of jealousy or of revenge, or of cruelty or of, injustice. These are human attributes; and the book which ascribes, them to the Infinite must be human also. It isn't true that the laws of, Nature have been capriciously disturbed, that snakes have talked, that, women have been turned to salt, that rods have brought water out of, rocks. You must in honesty confess that if these things were presented, to us when we were, adults for the first time, we should smile at them., It isn't true that the Fountain of all common sense should punish a race, for a venial offence committed by a person long since dead, and then, should add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon, a single innocent scapegoat. Can you not see all the want of justice, and logic, to say nothing of the want of mercy, involved in such a, conception? Can you not see it, Bertie? How can you blind yourself to, it! Take your eyes away from the details for a moment, and look at this, root idea of the predominant Faith. Is the general conception of it, consistent with infinite wisdom and mercy? If not, what becomes of the, dogmas, the sacraments, the whole scheme which is founded upon this, sand-bank? Courage, my friend! At the right moment all will be laid, aside, as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which, has been a good friend to him in his weakness. But his changes won't be, over then. His hobble will become a walk, and his walk a run. There is, no finality--CAN be none since the question concerns the infinite. All, this, which appears too advanced to you to-day, will seem reactionary, and conservative a thousand years hence.\\n\\nWhen I woke in the morning, and looked round at the bare walls and the, basin on the packing case, I hardly knew where I was. Cullingworth came, charging into the room in his dressing gown, however, and roused me, effectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed, and, throwing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow, with a thud. He was in great spirits, and, squatting on the bed, he held, forth about his plans while I dressed.\\n\\nand I spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to, celebrate the occasion. Old Cullingworth has always had a very high, opinion of lunatics for beginners. \\\"Get a lunatic, my boy! Get a, lunatic!\\\" he used to say. Then it was not only the situation, but the, fine connection that it opened up. I seemed to see exactly what would, happen. There would be illness in the family,--Lord Saltire himself, perhaps, or his wife. There would be no time to send for advice. I would, be consulted. I would gain their confidence and become their family, attendant. They would recommend me to their wealthy friends. It was all, as clear as possible. I was debating before I reached home whether it, would be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order, to take the Professorship which might be offered me.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"If you are so anxious to make a business matter, of it, you can arrange it so.\\\" I could not make out, and cannot make out, now, what had happened to freeze them up so; but I supposed that they, had been talking it over, and came to the conclusion that I was settling, down too much upon the old lines, and that they must remind me that I, was under orders to quit. They might have done it with more tact.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the more human traits--'weak' is hardly the word I should have, used. His rebuke of the Sabbatarians, His personal violence to the, hucksters, His outbursts against the Pharisees, His rather unreasoning, petulance against the fig-tree because it bore no fruit at the wrong, season of the year, His very human feeling towards the housewife who, bustled about when He was talking, his gratification that the ointment, should have been used for Him instead of being devoted to the poor\\n\\nI have told you this trivial little scene, Bertie, to show the strange, way in which Cullingworth springs quarrels upon me; suddenly, without, the slightest possible provocation, taking a most offensive tone, and, then when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance, turning, the whole thing to chaff. This has occurred again and again recently;, and, when coupled with the change in Mrs. Cullingworth's demeanour\\n\\nAs to old Cullingworth, he is booming along as merrily as ever. You say, in your last, that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of, the public in so short a time. That is just the point which I have found, it hard to get light upon. He told me that after his first coming he had, not a patient for a month, and that he was so disheartened that he very, nearly made a moonlight exodus. At last, however, a few cases came his, way--and he made such extraordinary cures of them, or else impressed, them so by his eccentricity, that they would do nothing but talk of him., Some of his wonderful results got into the local press, though, after, my Avonmouth experience, I should not like to guarantee that he did not, himself convey them there. He showed me an almanac, which had a great, circulation in the district.\\n\\nBut--there is a great big \\\"but\\\" in the case. You must ride yourself on, the curb the whole time. Unless you are sure--absolutely sure--that you, can do this, you are far best at home. You must never for one instant, forget yourself. You must remember what your object is in being there., You must inspire respect. Be friendly, genial, convivial--what you, will--but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman. If you can make, yourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that, you join a fresh introduction to practice. But beware of drink! Above, everything, beware of drink! The company that you are in may condone, it in each other, but never in the man who wishes them to commit their, lives to his safe keeping. A slip is fatal--a half slip perilous. Make, your rule of life and go by it, in spite of challenge or coaxers. It, will be remembered in your favour next morning.\\n\\nWhen first I came out of the faith in which I had been reared, I, certainly did feel for a time as if my life-belt had burst. I won't, exaggerate and say that I was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual, darkness. Youth is too full of action for that. But I was conscious of a, vague unrest, of a constant want of repose, of an emptiness and hardness, which I had not noticed in life before. I had so identified religion, with the Bible that I could not conceive them apart. When the foundation, proved false, the whole structure came rattling about my ears. And then, good old Carlyle came to the rescue; and partly from him, and partly, from my own broodings, I made a little hut of my own, which has kept me, snug ever since, and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides.\\n\\nfull of every lofty aspiration, and that a gross physical cause, such, as the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on, to the surface of the membrane which covers his brain, may have the, ultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every, bestial attribute! That a man's individuality should swing round, from pole to pole, and yet that one life should contain these two, contradictory personalities--is it not a wondrous thing?\\n\\nSmeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some, one is conspiring to poison him with copper, against which he takes the, most extravagant precautions. It is the strangest sight, he says, to, see Cullingworth at his meals; for he sits with an elaborate chemical, apparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow, with which he, tests samples of every course. I could not help laughing at Smeaton's, description, and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it. Of all, ruins, that of a fine man is the saddest.\\n\\ncooking,--we became more and more exacting. So at last we made our, selection; a Miss Wotton, who asked leave to bring her sister with her., She was a hard-faced brusque-mannered person, whose appearance in a, bachelor's household was not likely to cause a scandal. Her nose was in, itself a certificate of virtue. She was to bring her furniture into, the basement, and I was to give her and her sister one of the two upper, rooms for a bedroom.\\n\\nFrom that I turned to the most important point of all--the arrangement, of my consulting room. My experience with Cullingworth had taught me, one thing at least,--that patients care nothing about your house if they, only think that you can cure them. Once get that idea into their, heads, and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your, prescriptions on the manger. Still, as this was, for many a day to, come, to be the only furnished room in my house, it was worth a little, planning to get it set out to the best advantage.\\n\\n, I am writing this, my dear Bertie, at a little table which has been, fitted up in the window of my bedroom. Every one in the house is asleep, except myself; and all the noise of the city is hushed. Yet my own brain, is singularly active, and I feel that I am better employed in sitting, up and writing to you, than in tossing about upon my bed. I am often, accused of being sleepy in the daytime, but every now and then Nature, gets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night.\\n\\nI was supposed to have my eye upon him all day, with a two-hour interval, every afternoon and an evening to myself upon Fridays. But then what was, the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near, and I had, no friends whom I could visit? I did a fair amount of reading, for Lord, Saltire let me have the run of his library. Gibbon gave me a couple of, enchanting weeks. You know the effect that he produces. You seem to, be serenely floating upon a cloud, and looking down on all these pigmy, armies and navies, with a wise Mentor ever at your side to whisper to, you the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama.\\n\\nas we wonder to-day. I suppose that we DO know a little more than they., We have an arc of about three thousand years given us, from which to, calculate out the course to be described by our descendants; but that, arc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which Providence uses in, working out its designs that our deductions from it must, I think, be, uncertain. Will civilisation be swamped by barbarism? It happened once, before, because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of, darkness. But what, for example, could break down the great country in, which you dwell? No, our civilisation will endure and grow more complex., Man will live in the air and below the water. Preventive medicine will, develop until old age shall become the sole cause of death. Education, and a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime. The, English-speaking races will unite, with their centre in the United, States. Gradually the European States will follow their example. War, will become rare, but more terrible. The forms of religion will be, abandoned, but the essence will be maintained; so that one universal, creed will embrace the whole civilised earth, which will preach trust, in that central power, which will be as unknown then as now. That's my, horoscope, and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking. But, Bertie Swanborough and Stark Munro will be blowing about on the west, wind, and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half, of it has come to pass.\\n\\nI sat in my house all day, with that ever-present sense of privacy and, novelty which had thrilled me when I first shut the street door behind, me. At evening I sallied out and bought a loaf of bread, half a pound, of tea (\\\"sweepings,\\\" they call it, and it cost eightpence), a tin, kettle (fivepence), a pound of sugar, a tin of Swiss milk, and a tin, of American potted meat. I had often heard my mother groan over the, expenses of housekeeping, and now I began to understand what she meant., Two and ninepence went like a flash, but at least I had enough to keep, myself going for some days.\\n\\nwhich has been deepening from day to day. Well, it seemed to reach a, climax this morning, and on our way to the rooms I could hardly get a, word out of him. The place was fairly crowded with patients, but my, own share was rather below the average. When I had finished I added a, chapter to my novel, and waited until he and his wife were ready for the, daily bag-carrying homewards.\\n\\nThat evening, and for many evenings to come, we worked upon our liver., For our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat, in an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the, non-nitrogenous waxy matter. With our limited appliances the only way, we could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying, pan. So night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of, a beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in, making these grim fricassees. Nothing came of all our work; for though, Cullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case, and, wrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject, he was never, apt at stating his views with his pen, and he left, I am sure, a very, confused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was, driving at. Again, as he was a mere student without any letters after, his name, he got scant attention, and I never heard that he gained over, a single supporter.\\n\\nNow and again young Derwent introduced some excitement into my dull, life. On one occasion when we were walking in the grounds, he suddenly, snatched up a spade from a grass-plot, and rushed at an inoffensive, under-gardener. The man ran screaming for his life, with my patient, cursing at his very heels, and me within a few paces of him. When I at, last laid my hand on his collar, he threw down his weapon and burst into, shrieks of laughter. It was only mischief and not ferocity; but when, that under-gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like, a cream cheese. At night the attendant slept in a camp-bed at the foot, of the patient's, and my room was next door, so that I could be called, if necessary. No, it was not a very exhilarating life!\\n\\nand I hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and, theologians: \\\"our gross frames\\\" and \\\"our miserable mortal clay\\\" are, phrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety. It, is no compliment to the Creator to depreciate His handiwork. Whatever, theory or belief we may hold about the soul, there can, I suppose, be, no doubt that the body is immortal. Matter may be transformed (in which, case it may be re-transformed), but it can never be destroyed. If, a comet were to strike this globule of ours, and to knock it into a, billion fragments, which were splashed all over the solar system--if, its fiery breath were to lick up the earth's surface until it was peeled, like an orange, still at the end of a hundred millions of years, every tiniest particle of our bodies would exist--in other forms and, combinations, it is true, but still those very atoms which now form the, forefinger which traces these words. So the child with the same wooden, bricks will build a wall, then strew them on the table; then a tower\\n\\nIt wasn't a pretty sight. A woman, pinched and bedraggled, with a baby, on her arm, was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom I, judged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her. He was, one of those red-faced, dark-eyed men who can look peculiarly malignant, when they choose. It was clear that he was half mad with drink, and that, she had been trying to lure him away from some den. I was just in time, to see him take a flying kick at her, amid cries of \\\"Shame!\\\" from the, crowd, and then lurch forward again, with the evident intention of, having another, the mob still expostulating vaguely.\\n\\nThis pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes., I remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent, London specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row, who, amused himself by interjecting remarks. The lecturer appealed to his, audience at last. \\\"These interruptions are insufferable, gentlemen,\\\", said he; \\\"will no one free me from this annoyance?\\\" \\\"Hold your, tongue--you, sir, on the front bench,\\\" cried Cullingworth, in his, bull's bellow. \\\"Perhaps you'll make me,\\\" said the fellow, turning a, contemptuous face over his shoulder. Cullingworth closed his note-book\\n\\n, He was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity. You, cannot imagine a more savage-looking creature than Cullingworth is when, his temper goes wrong. He gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his, light blue eyes, and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra. He, isn't a beauty at his best, but at his worst he's really phenomenal. At, the first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room.\\n\\n\\\"You will permit me, Dr. Munro, sir, to place this trifle in your room., It's lava, sir; lava from Vesuvius, and made in Naples. By ----, you may, think its empty, Dr. Munro, sir, but it is full of my best wishes; and, when you've got the best practice in this town you may point to that, vase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport, who, backed you from the start.\\\"\\n\\nI had the kindest of leave takings from Horton. If he had been my, brother he could not have been more affectionate. I could not have, thought that I should grow so fond of a man in so short a time. He, takes the keenest interest in my venture, and I am to write him a full, account. He gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had, coloured himself--the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker., It was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at Bradfield, I, had a little harbour at Merton for which I could make. Still, of course\\n\\nmakes a most substantial meal. Butter I have discarded for the present., My actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day, but I am a, patron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day, which I, expend upon an evening paper; for with events hurrying on like this in, Alexandria, I cannot bear to be without the news. Still I often reproach, myself with that halfpenny, for if I went out in the evening and looked, at the placards I might save it, and yet have a general idea of what is, going on. Of course, a halfpenny a night sounds nothing, but think of a, shilling a month! Perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on, this diet! I am thin, it is true, but I never felt more fit in my life., So full of energy am I that I start off sometimes at ten at night and, walk hard until two or three in the morning. I dare not go out during, the day, you see, for fear that I should miss a patient. I have asked my, mother not to send little Paul down yet until I see my way more clearly.\\n\\nThen there are other cures which depend, I think, upon his own personal, magnetism. He is so robust and loud-voiced and hearty that a weak, nervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality. He is so, perfectly confident that he can cure them, that he makes them perfectly, confident that they can be cured; and you know how in nervous cases the, mind reacts upon the body. If he chose to preserve crutches and sticks\\n\\nThere was one other incident, however. One day after I had been in, practice about two months, I observed a bearded commonplace-looking, person lounging about on the other side of the road. In the afternoon he, was again visible from my consulting-room window. When I saw him there, once more next morning, my suspicions were aroused, and they became, certainties when, a day or so afterwards, I came out of a patient's, house in a poor street, and saw the same fellow looking into a, greengrocer's shop upon the other side. I walked to the end of the, street, waited round the corner, and met him as he came hurrying after.\\n\\nHowever, she took it most admirably. They were all three at breakfast, when I came round, the general, Mrs. La Force, and the daughter. Somehow, they seemed to know all that I had to say at the very sight of me; and, in their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me, for the, shock I had suffered, and the disturbance of my household. I found, myself turned from the consoler into the consoled. For an hour or more, we talked it over, I explaining what I hope needed no explanation, that, as the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to, know how immediate was his danger. There can be no doubt that the fall, of temperature and the quietness which both Porter and I had looked upon, as a hopeful sign, were really the beginning to the end.\\n\\nthere's order! And where there is order there must be mind, and where, there is mind there must be sense of Justice. I don't allow that there, can be any doubt as to the existence of that central Mind, or as to the, possession by it of certain attributes. The stars help me to realise, these. It is strange, when one looks upon them, to think that the, Churches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether, the Almighty is most gratified by our emptying a tea-spoonful of water, over our babies' heads, or by our waiting a few years and then plunging, them bodily into a tank. It would be comic if it were not so tragic.\\n\\nimmediately after my breach with Cullingworth. It's rather hard to know, where to begin when one has so many events to narrate, disconnected from, each other, and trivial in themselves, yet which have each loomed large, as I came upon them, though they look small enough now that they are so, far astern. As I have mentioned Cullingworth, I may as well say first, the little that is to be said about him. I answered his letter in the, way which I have, I think, already described. I hardly expected to hear, from him again; but my note had evidently stung him, and I had a, brusque message in which he said that if I wished him to believe in my, \\\"bona-fides\\\" (whatever he may have meant by that), I would return the, money which I had had during the time that I was with him at Bradfield., To this I replied that the sum was about twelve pounds; that I still, retained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds, if I came to Bradfield, that the balance in my favour was two hundred, and eighty-eight pounds; and that unless I had a cheque by return, I, should put the matter into the hands of my solicitor. This put a final, end to our correspondence.\\n\\nWhen the supper was finished, Cullingworth led the way into a small, sitting-room, where we both lit our pipes, and Mrs. Cullingworth her, cigarette. He sat for some little time in silence, and then bounding up, rushed to the door and flung it open. It is always one of his strange, peculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring, against him; for, in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness\\n\\npull up your socks!\\\" I should have been less surprised. And then, suddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind, and I rushed to, the cellar. The cask was tilted forward on the trestles. I struck it and, it boomed like a drum. I turned the tap, and not one drop appeared. Let, us draw a veil over the painful scene. Suffice it that Mrs. Wotton got, her marching orders then and there--and that next day Paul and I found, ourselves alone in the empty house once more.\\n\\nBut in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the, beginning of my stay with him, for my mother's letters stigmatising his, conduct had begun very early. For some time he had been uncertain how, to proceed. Then he had invented the excuse (which seemed to me at the, time, if you remember, to be quite inadequate) about the slight weekly, decline in the practice in order to get me out of it. His next move, was to persuade me to start for myself; and as this would be impossible, without money, he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small, weekly loan. I remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about, ordering furniture and other things, because tradesmen gave long credit, to beginners, and I could always fall back upon him if necessary. He, knew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at, least a year's tenancy. Then he waited to spring his mine until I had, written to say that I had finally committed myself, on which by return, of post came his letter breaking the connection. It was so long and so, elaborate a course of deceit, that I for the first time felt something, like fear as I thought of Cullingworth. It was as though in the, guise and dress of a man I had caught a sudden glimpse of something, sub-human--of something so outside my own range of thought that I was, powerless against it.\\n\\nIt was only when I went to my bedroom that I realised the oversights, which I had made in my furnishing. There was no mattress and no pillow, or bed-clothes. My mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the, practice, that I had never given a thought to my own private wants. I, slept that night upon the irons of my bed, and rose up like St. Lawrence, from the gridiron. My second suit of clothes with Bristowe's \\\"Principles, of Medicine\\\" made an excellent pillow, while on a warm June night a, man can do well wrapped in his overcoat. I had no fancy for second-hand, bed-clothes, and determined until I could buy some new ones, to make, myself a straw pillow, and to put on both my suits of clothes on the, colder nights. Two days later, however, the problem was solved in more, luxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother\\n\\nso that Lady Teazle or Mrs. Sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan, chair without soiling her dainty satin shoes. It brings home to me what, an unstable chemical compound man is. Here are the stage accessories, as good as ever, while the players have all split up into hydrogen, and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, with traces of iron and silica and, phosphorus. A tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water,--there, is the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair! It's a curious double, picture, if one could but conjure it up. On the one side, the high-born, bucks, the mincing ladies, the scheming courtiers, pushing and planning\\n\\n\\\"Of course, you see that the whole thing is to scale. My warship of the, future carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much, larger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet., Or I might have a separate raft, possibly, to carry my apparatus. My, ship goes into action. What happens then, Munro? Eh, what! Every shot, fired at her goes smack on to the magnet. There's a reservoir below into, which they drop when the electric circuit is broken. After every action, they are sold by auction for old metal, and the result divided as prize, money among the crew. But think of it, man! I tell you it is an absolute, impossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my, apparatus. And then look at the cheapness. You don't want armour. You, want nothing. Any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of, these. The war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound, ten. You're grinning again; but if you give me a magnet and a Brixton, trawler with a seven-pounder gun I'll show sport to the finest, battle-ship afloat.\\\"\\n\\nOf course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the, question. I could not feed one, far less pay one, and I had no kitchen, furniture. I must open my door to my own patients--let them think what, they would of it. I must clean my own plate and brush down my own front;, and these duties must be thoroughly done, come what might, for I must, show a presentable outside to the public. Well, there was no great, hardship in that, for I could do it under the cover of night. But I had, had a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely. She, had written to say that if I wished she would send my little brother, Paul to keep me company. I wrote back eagerly to agree. He was a hardy, cheery little fellow of nine, who would, I knew, gladly share hard times, with me; while, if they became unduly so, I could always have him taken, home again. Some weeks must pass before he could come, but it cheered me, to think of him. Apart from his company, there were a thousand ways in, which he might be useful.\\n\\nPoor chap, he had little enough to be cheery over either. He was an old, soldier who had lost a good many teeth, but who had continued to find, room between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe. Lately there, appeared a small sore on his nose which had spread, and become crusted., On feeling it I found it as hard as a streak of glue, with constant, darting pains passing through it. Of course, there could be no question, as to diagnosis. It was epitheliomatous cancer, caused by the irritation, of the hot tobacco smoke. I sent him back to his village, and two days, after I drove over in Cullingworth's dog-cart, and removed the growth. I, only got a sovereign for it. But it may be a nucleus for cases. The, old fellow did most admirably, and he has just been in (with a most, aristocratic curl to his nostrils) to tell me that he has bought a box, full of churchwardens. It was my first operation, and I daresay I was, more nervous about it than my patient, but the result has given me, confidence. I have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me. Come, what may, I am prepared to do it. Why should a man wait? Of course\\n\\nhowever, that at its best it is not worth more than L700 a year, with no, room for expansion. This is not large enough to keep two of us at work., Then, again, there are times when I can see that my religious opinions, annoy the dear old man. On the whole, and for every reason, I think, that it would be better if I were out of this. I applied for several, steamship lines, and for at least a dozen house surgeonships; but there, is as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as, if it were the Viceroyship of India. As a rule, I simply get my, testimonials returned without any comment, which is the sort of thing, that teaches a man humility. Of course, it is very pleasant to live with, the mater, and my little brother Paul is a regular trump. I am teaching, him boxing; and you should see him put his tiny fists up, and counter, with his right. He got me under the jaw this evening, and I had to ask, for poached eggs for supper.\\n\\nI wrote to you last on the night that I reached here. Next morning I set, to work upon my task. You would be surprised (at least I was) to see, how practical and methodical I can be. First of all I walked down to the, post-office and I bought a large shilling map of the town. Then back I, came and pinned this out upon the lodging-house table. This done, I set, to work to study it, and to arrange a series of walks by which I should, pass through every street of the place. You have no idea what that means, until you try to do it. I used to have breakfast, get out about ten\\n\\nIt was a newspaper cutting, which gave the true account of the incident., Suffice it that it was an ice accident, and that Cullingworth had really, behaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible, with, the child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered, his senses that they were able to separate them. I had hardly finished, reading it when we heard his step on the stairs; and she, thrusting, the paper back into her bosom, became in an instant the same silently, watchful woman as ever.\\n\\nwhich might no doubt involve some technical impossibility, but which, would at least be quite plausible and new. Then as he drew, his, bristling eyebrows would contract, his small eyes would gleam with, excitement, his lips would be pressed together, and he would end by, banging on the paper with his open hand, and shouting in his exultation., You would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes., But next instant, if you were to express surprise as to how it was that, the Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids, out, would come the pencil and envelope, and he would propound a scheme for, doing that with equal energy and conviction. This ingenuity was joined, to an extremely sanguine nature. As he paced up and down in his jerky, quick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention, he would, take out patents for it, receive you as his partner in the enterprise\\n\\n, I was so delighted, my dear chap, to have your assurance that nothing, that I have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend, you. It is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved I was at your, cordial letter. I have no one to whom I can talk upon such matters. I, am all driven inwards, and thought turns sour when one lets it, stagnate like that. It is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a, sympathetic listener--and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all, from another standpoint. It steadies and sobers one.\\n\\n\\\"By ----, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, \\\"I've asked every ---- man in, Birchespool that's got anything the matter with him. You'll have the, lot as patients within a week. There's Fraser, who's got a touch of, Martell's three star. He's coming. And there's Saunders, who talks about, nothing but his spleen. I'm sick of his ---- spleen! But I asked him., And there's Turpey's wound! This wet weather sets it tingling, and his, own surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline. He'll be there. And, there's Carr, who is drinking himself to death. He has not much for the, doctors, but what there is you may as well have.\\\"\\n\\nHis carriage was waiting, and we drove out to his residence, The, Myrtles, where I was speedily introduced both to his family and his, practice. The former is small, and the latter enormous. The wife is, dead; but her mother, Mrs. White, keeps house for him; and there are two, dear little girls, about five and seven. Then there is an unqualified, assistant, a young Irish student, who, with the three maids, the, coachman, and the stable boy, make up the whole establishment. When I, tell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do, you will, have an idea of the ground we cover.\\n\\nBut then our individuality? I often wonder whether something of that, wilt cling to our atoms--whether the dust of Johnnie Munro will ever, have something of him about it, and be separable from that of Bertie, Swanborough. I think it is possible that we DO impress ourselves upon, the units of our own structure. There are facts which tend to show that, every tiny organic cell of which a man is composed, contains in its, microcosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a, part. The ovum itself from which we are all produced is, as you know\\n\\n\\\"Let us see!\\\" says she, looking at the slate. \\\"He will be clear at seven, minutes past eight this evening. Yes, he could just manage it then. He, has no one at all from seven past to the quarter past\\\"--and so at the, appointed hour I have my patient precipitating himself into my room with, the demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a, railway station. If he knew that he is probably the only patient who has, opened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry--or think so, much of my advice.\\n\\n\\\"That's it,\\\" he shouted, stabbing at me with the amber. \\\"Naval supremacy, and command of the seas. It's all here right under your nose. I tell, you, Munro, I could go to Switzerland to-morrow, and I could say to, them--'Look here, you haven't got a seaboard and you haven't got a port;, but just find me a ship, and hoist your flag on it, and I'll give you, every ocean under heaven.' I'd sweep the seas until there wasn't a, match-box floating on them. Or I could make them over to a limited, company, and join the board after allotment. I hold the salt water in, the cup of this hand, every drop of it.\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed again in the most good-humoured way, and, as soon as, the young fellow had recovered, we all joined in quite a confidential, conversation. It is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities, of life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette. In half an hour we knew, all about each other, or at any rate I knew all about them. Mrs. La, Force was the mother's name, a widow with these two children. They had, given up housekeeping, and found it more pleasant to live in apartments\\n\\n\\\"I take a cursed interest in the whole thing. You may think it a ----, impertinence, but that's the way I'm made. As long as I can steam I'll, throw a rope to whoever wants a tow. I'll tell you what I'll do, Dr., Munro, sir. I'll stand on one tack if you'll stand on the other, and, I'll let you know if I come across anything that will do.\\\"\\n\\nThis train of thought is the after-swell from an argument with, Cullingworth this evening. He holds that the human race is deteriorating, mentally and morally. He calls out at the grossness which confounds the, Creator with a young Jewish Philosopher. I tried to show him that this, is no proof of degeneration, since the Jewish Philosopher at least, represented a moral idea, and was therefore on an infinitely higher, plane than the sensual divinities of the ancients. His own views of the, Creator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration. He declares, that looking round at Nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and, brutality. \\\"Either the Creator is not all-powerful, or else He is not, all-good,\\\" says he. \\\"Either He can stop these atrocities and won't, in, which case He is not all-good; or else He would stop them but can't, in, which case He is not all-powerful.\\\" It was a difficult dilemma for a man, who professes to stick to reason to get out of. Of course, if you plead, faith, you can always slip out of anything. I was forced to get behind, a corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own, thrusts. I said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted, that that which seemed evil really was EVIL. \\\"It lies with you to prove, that it isn't,\\\" said he. \\\"We may hope that it isn't,\\\" said I. \\\"Wait, until some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the, stomach,\\\" said he; and he shouted it out again every time I tried to, renew the argument.\\n\\nand I was going to leave Cullingworth at once. Then within a couple, of posts I had to write again and announce that my departure was, indefinitely postponed, and that I was actually doing his whole, practice. Well, the dear old lady was very angry. I don't suppose she, quite understood how temporary the necessity was, and how impossible it, would have been to leave Cullingworth in the lurch. She was silent for, nearly three weeks, and then she wrote a very stinging letter (and she, handles her adjectives most deftly when she likes). She went so far, as to say that Cullingworth was a \\\"bankrupt swindler,\\\" and that I had, dragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association, with him. This letter came on the morning of the very last day that my, patient was confined to the house. When I returned from work I found him, sitting in his dressing-gown downstairs. His wife, who had driven home\\n\\nIn the morning I went round to Mrs. La Force and gave her a bulletin., Her brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left., He had the Victoria Cross it seems, and was one of the desperate little, garrison who held Lucknow in that hell-whirl of a mutiny. And now the, sudden opening of a door sets him shaking, and a dropped tongs gives him, palpitations. Are we not the strangest kind of beings?\\n\\nWell, matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up, to the Dad saying that Mrs. Andrews' servant was ill, and would he come, at once. The old man had a touch of gout, so I donned my professional, coat and sallied forth, thinking that perhaps I might combine pleasure, with business, and have a few words with Laura. Sure enough, as I passed, up the gravel drive which curves round to the door, I glanced through, the drawing-room window, and saw her sitting painting, with her back, to the light. It was clear that she had not heard me. The hall door was, ajar, and when I pushed it open, no one was in the hall. A sudden fit, of roguishness came over me. I pushed the drawing-room door very slowly, wider, crept in on tiptoe, stole quietly across, and bending down, I, kissed the artist upon the nape of her neck. She turned round with a, squeal, and it was the mother!\\n\\nwhich was as extraordinary as everything else he did. I won't tell it, to you here, my dear Bertie, for I feel that I have dived down too many, side streets already; but it was a most bustling business, in which the, locking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of Cullingworth's, hair played prominent parts. Apropos of the latter he was never quite, able to get rid of its traces; and from this time forward there was, added to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight, struck upon his hair at certain angles, it turned it all iridescent and, shimmering.\\n\\nWe had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both, of us, without, however, any allusion to our past quarrel. He would, not admit that he had left Bradfield on account of a falling-off in his, practice, or for any reason except that he found the place too small., His spring-screen invention had, he said, been favourably reported upon, by one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the Clyde, and there, was every probability of their adopting it.\\n\\n\\\"Why the devil should we do all the good, Munro?\\\" he shouts. \\\"Eh, what? A, butcher would do good to the race, would he not, if he served his chops, out gratis through the window? He'd be a real benefactor; but he goes, on selling them at a shilling the pound for all that. Take the case of, a doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science. He flushes out drains\\n\\nAnd then the more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance, not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound, interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been, accumulated since the dawning of time. Some eighty thousand years are, supposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man. Yet, in all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of, chipping them. But within our father's lives what changes have there not, been? The railway and the telegraph, chloroform and applied electricity., Ten years now go further than a thousand then, not so much on account, of our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to, more. Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain, footsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal.\\n\\nWe filed off once more, he leading with the huge brass \\\"Dr. Munro\\\", under his arm; then the little woman, and then this rather perturbed, and bemuddled young man. He and his wife sat on the deal table in the, consulting room, like a hawk and a turtle-dove on the same perch, while, I leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets. Nothing, could be more prosaic and informal; but I knew very well that I was at a, crisis of my life. Before, it was only a choosing between two roads. Now, my main track had run suddenly to nothing, and I must go back or find a, bye-path.\\n\\nAm I not the slowest of story-tellers? But you encourage me to it by, your sympathetic interest in details. However, I shall move along a, little faster now. Next morning I was off to Lochtully, which, as you, know, is in the north of Perthshire. It stands three miles from the, station, a great gray pinnacled house, with two towers cocking out above, the fir woods, like a hare's ears from a tussock of grass. As we drove, up to the door I felt pretty solemn--not at all as the main line should, do when it condescends to visit the cadet branch. Into the hall as I, entered came a grave learned-looking man, with whom in my nervousness, I was about to shake hands cordially. Fortunately he forestalled the, impending embrace by explaining that he was the butler. He showed, me into a small study, where everything stank of varnish and morocco, leather, there to await the great man. He proved when he came to be a, much less formidable figure than his retainer--indeed, I felt thoroughly, at my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth. He is grizzled\\n\\nSo those were the last words of Cullingworth, and the last that I may, ever see of him also, for he starts almost immediately upon his strange, venture. He must succeed. He is a man whom nothing could hold down. I, wish him luck, and have a kindly feeling towards him, and yet I distrust, him from the bottom of my heart, and shall be just as pleased to know, that the Atlantic rolls between us.\\n\\nThey moved in a few days later. I was out at the time, and the first, intimation I had was finding three little dogs in my hall when I, returned. I had her up, and explained that this was a breach of, contract, and that I had no thoughts of running a menagerie.

She was dressed as for a journey, and about the corners, of her mouth were lines familiar to Christopher, the sight of which sent, his heart into his boots. Fortunately, he recovered himself in time to, greet her with a smile. It was not the smile he had been rehearsing half, the day, but that it was a smile of any sort astonished the words away, from Mrs. Korner's lips, and gave him the inestimable advantage of first, speech.\\n\\n\\\"I was unable to oblige you before,\\\" explained Mr. Korner, \\\"having to, keep my head clear for business, and not knowing what the effect upon, one might be. Yesterday I did my best, and I hope you are pleased with, me. Though, if you could see your way to being content--just for the, present and until I get more used to it--with a similar performance not, oftener than once a fortnight, say, I should be grateful,\\\" added Mr., Korner.\\n\\n\\\"We had one bottle of claret between us,\\\" Mr. Korner would often recall, to his mind, \\\"of which he drank the greater part. And then he brought, out the little green flask. He said it was made from pears--that in Peru, they kept it specially for Children's parties. Of course, that may have, been his joke; but in any case I cannot see how just one glass--I wonder, could I have taken more than one glass while he was talking.\\\" It was a, point that worried Mr. Korner.\\n\\nThe \\\"he\\\" who had talked, possibly, to such bad effect was a distant, cousin of Mr. Korner's, one Bill Damon, chief mate of the steamship, _La Fortuna_. Until their chance meeting that afternoon in Leadenhall, Street, they had not seen each other since they were boys together. The, _Fortuna_ was leaving St. Katherine's Docks early the next morning bound, for South America, and it might be years before they met again. As Mr., Damon pointed out, Fate, by thus throwing them into each other's arms\\n\\n\\\"Sorry I am late,\\\" said Mr. Korner, bursting cheerfully into the room., It was a point with Mr. Korner always to be cheerful in the morning., \\\"Greet the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing,\\\" was, the motto Mrs. Korner, this day a married woman of six months and three, weeks standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on, precisely two hundred and two occasions. The Motto entered largely into, the scheme of Mr. Korner's life. Written in fine copperplate upon cards, all of the same size, a choice selection counselled him each morning, from the rim of his shaving-glass.\\n\\n\\\"You sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached, eggs, while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table. At, the end of it, seeing you had gone to sleep yourself, I persuaded her, to go to bed. It was three o'clock, and we thought you would not mind.\\\", Miss Greene drew up a chair, and, with her elbows on the table, looked, across at Mr. Korner. Decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of Mrs., Korner's bosom friend.\\n\\nMr. Korner sat up suddenly and looked about him. This was not bed., The fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the, tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A, tingling sensation about his head called for investigation. Mr. Korner, was forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a, salad of him--somebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard. A, sound directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.\\n\\nThe sight of Acacia Villa, suggesting that everybody was in bed and, asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife would have been, sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting, on the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As, the door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring., The window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.\\n\\nit suddenly occurred to Mr. Korner that he was an unappreciated man., Mrs. Korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which, the beauties of the Southern Main endeavoured feebly to express their, consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no way--as far as he could, see--to Mr. Korner himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner, did say and did do, tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes. Noticing that, a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and, hurried on. Pacing the platform of the Mansion House Station, where, it is always draughty, the thought of his wrongs returned to him with, renewed force. Why was there no trace of doglike devotion about Mrs., Korner? The fault--so he bitterly told himself--the fault was his., \\\"A woman loves her master; it is her instinct,\\\" mused Mr. Korner to, himself. \\\"Damme,\\\" thought Mr. Korner, \\\"I don't believe that half her, time she knows I am her master.\\\"\\n\\nThe two friends talked of many things. And later on they spoke of, sweethearts and of wives. Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been, wide and varied. They talked--or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr., Korner listened--of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of, the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian, valleys. The mate had theories concerning the care and management of, women: theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood, the test of studied application. A new world opened out to Mr. Korner;, a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who\",\n          \"and such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you., You said what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered, to no one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost, like a gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the, devil himself. Why should you? While your cousin Philip, with his, parrot talk and sneaking ways, turned my stomach. I was sick of him\\n\\nScarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon Mrs., Manners. Her first care, and Dorothy's, was to catechise me most, particularly on my state. And whilst they were so occupied Mr. Marmaduke, entered, wholly frenzied from fright, and utterly oblivious to his own, blame in the matter. He was sent out again directly. After that, with, Aunt Lucy to assist, they hurriedly packed what few things might be, taken. The costly relics of Arlington Street were untouched, and the, French clock was left on the mantel to tick all the night, and for days, to come, in a silent and forsaken room; or perhaps to greet impassively, the King's officers when they broke in at the door. But I caught my lady, in the act of wrapping up the Wedgwood cups and dishes.\\n\\nalways chosen by my lady herself. There I sat by the hour, swathed in, many layers of wool, and tended by her hands alone. Every nook and, cranny of our lives were revealed to the other. She loved to hear of, Patty and my years at Gordon's, and would listen with bated breath to the, stories of the Ranger and the Bonhomme Richard, and of that strange man, whom we both loved, whose genius had made those cruises famous., Sometimes, in low voices, we talked of our future; but often, when the, wind blew and the deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters, a, silence would fall between us that needed no word to interpret.\\n\\nlaunching forth at once, nothing daunted by such cold conservatism., \\\"What Israelite brickmaker of Pharaoh's dreamed of Solomon's temple?, Nay, Moses himself had no conception of it. And God will send us our, pillars of cloud and of fire. We must be reconciled to our great, destiny, Mr. Carroll. No fight ever was won by man or nation content, with half a victory. We have forests to build an hundred armadas, and I, will command a fleet and it is given me.\\\"\\n\\nNot a sound came from Dorothy, nor did I dare to look at her face. The, whole matter was clear to me now. After his conversation with me, Mr., Marmaduke had lost no time in seeing Mr. Dix, in order to raise money on, my prospects. And the man of business had gone straight to Grafton with, the intelligence. The suspicion flashed through me that Mr. Allen had, been sent to spy, but his very next words disarmed it.\\n\\nThen a cry came floating down from aloft. Thrice did I hear it, like one, waking out of a sleep, ere I grasped its import. \\\"The Alliance! The, Alliance!\\\" But hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the, ship, when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft, forward. \\\"She rakes us! She rakes us!\\\" And the French soldiers tumbled, headlong down from the poop with a wail of \\\"Les Anglais font prise!\\\", \\\"Her Englishmen have taken her, and turned her guns against us!\\\" Our, captain was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and, stripes waved black in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what, happened next. The gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down, his face, shouting that the Richard was sinking, and yelling for quarter, as he made for the ensign-staff on the poop, for the flag was shot away., Him the commodore felled with a pistol-butt. At the gunner's heels were, the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken, released by the master at, arms. They swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of, Tartars, unkempt and wild and desperate with fear, until I thought that, the added weight on the scarce-supported deck would land us all in the, bilges. Words fail me when I come to describe the frightful panic of, these creatures, frenzied by the instinct of self-preservation. They, surged hither and thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a, storm-swept coast. They trampled rough-shod over the moaning heaps of, wounded and dying, and crowded the crews at the guns, who were powerless, before their numbers. Some fought like maniacs, and others flung, themselves into the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, \\\"you have not dined, and neither have I. We shall be, merry to-day, and you shall have some of the best Madeira in the, colonies.\\\" I commanded a room, that we might have privacy. As he took, his seat opposite me I marked that he had grown heavier and more browned., But his eye had the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore. And, first I upbraided him for not having writ me.\\n\\nThe door creaked, and in my eagerness I tried to lift myself. 'Twas Aunt, Lucy's hand that restrained me, and the next face I saw was that of, Dorothy's mother. But why did it appear so old and sorrow-lined? And, why was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap? She took, my fingers in her own, and asked me anxiously if I felt any pain.\\n\\n\\\"Despite the host of troubles he had on his hands, your commodore himself, came with us to Rotterdam. Now I protest I love that man, who has more, humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in England who call him, hard names. If you could have seen him leaning over you, and speaking to, you, and feeling every minute for your heart-beats, egad, you would have, cried. And when I took you off to the schooner, he gave me an hundred, directions how to care for you, and then his sorrow bowled him all in a, heap.\\\"\\n\\nWhen I came on deck the next morning our yards were a-drip with a clammy, fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze. We were, standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused, in the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, and that we, were near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all, that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though, we had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my, eyes through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our, starboard beam.\\n\\nMrs. Manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to Carvel Hall. It was, on a sparkling morning in February that we sighted the familiar toe of, Kent Island, and the good-natured skipper put about and made for the, mouth of our river. Then, as of old, the white cupola of Carvel House, gleamed a signal of greeting, to which our full hearts beat a silent, response. Once again the great windmill waved its welcome, and the same, memory was upon us both as we gazed. Of a hale old gentleman in the, sheets of a sailing pinnace, of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering, with excitement of the days to come. Dorothy gently pressed my hand as, the bark came into the wind, and the boat was dropped into the green, water. Slowly they lowered me into it, for I was still helpless, Dorothy, and her mother and Aunt Lucy were got down, and finally Mr. Marmaduke, stepped gingerly from the sea-ladder over the gunwale. The cutter leaped, under the strong strokes up the river with the tide. Then, as we rounded, the bend, we were suddenly astonished to see people gathered on the, landing at the foot of the lawn, where they had run, no doubt, in a, flurry at sight of the ship below. In the front of the group stood, out a strangely familiar figure.\\n\\nFifty and five minutes had been registered by the French clock, when the, rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below, and Charles Fox, panted up the stairs, muffled in a huge wrap-rascal. 'Twas he and Aunt, Lucy carried me down to the street, Dorothy walking at my side, and, propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting., This was an ample travelling-carriage with a lamp hanging from its top\\n\\nSuddenly, glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were, aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big, Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great, ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the, mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes, sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the, commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our, guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.\\n\\nBefore we could answer he was gone into the night; and my Lord, standing, without, had closed the carriage door. And that was the last I saw of, this noble man, the true friend of America, who devoted his glorious, talents and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the, greatness of England. He who was followed by the prayers of the English, race was ever remembered in our own humble ones.\\n\\nwaited on by the old servants of my grandfather. At our whim my chair, would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts; on cool days, we sat in the sun by the dial, where the flowers mingled their odours, with the salt breezes off the Chesapeake; or anon, when it was warmer, in, the summer-house my mother loved, or under the shade of the great trees, on the lawn, looking out over the river. And once my lady went off very, mysteriously, her eyes brimful of mischief, to come back with the first, strawberries of the year staining her apron.\\n\\nLord Comyn and Mr. Fox. They may do something for you, now you own your, estate. My dear sir, I dislike to say aught against any man. Mrs., Manners will tell you of their kindness to us, but I vow I have not been, able to see it. With all the money at their command they will not loan, me a penny in my pressing need. And I shame to say it, my own daughter, prevents me from obtaining the money to keep us out of the Fleet. I know, she has spoken to Dulany. Think of it, Richard, my own daughter, upon, whom I lavished all when I had it, who might have made a score of grand, matches when I gave her the opportunity, and now we had all been rolling, in wealth. I'll be sworn I don't comprehend her, nor her mother either\\n\\n\\\"I have seen many men since, but never have I met your equal for a most, damnable frankness, Richard Carvel. Even Jack, here, is not half so, blunt and uncompromising. But you took my fancy--God knows why!--that, first night I clapped eyes on you in Arlington Street, and I loved you, when your simplicity made us that speech at Brooks's Club. So you have, not forgotten that morning under the trees, when the dew was on the, grass. Faith, I am glad of it. What children we were!\\\" he said, and, sighed.\\n\\nthough not very handsomely. Fears for my own safety alone kept me from, telling you and Mr. Swain. And I swear to you that I was sorry for the, venture almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling., The scheme was laid out before I took you for a pupil; indeed, that was, part of it, as you no doubt have guessed. As God hears me, I learned to, love you, Richard, in those days at the rectory. You were all of a man\\n\\n\\\"Ay, he's back,\\\" he returned, with a grunt that was half a growl; \\\"arter, three weeks breakin' o' liberty. I tell 'ee what, sir, them Frenchies is, treecherous devils, an' not to be trusted the len'th of a lead line. An', they beant seamen eno' to keep a full an' by with all their 'takteek'., Ez fer that Landais, I hearn him whinin' at the commodore in the round, house when we was off Clear, an' sayin' as how he would tell Sartin on us, when he gets back to Paree. An' jabberin to th'other Frenchmen as was, there that this here butter-cask was er King's ship, an' that the, commodore weren't no commodore nohow. They say as how Cap'n Jones be, bound up in a hard knot by some articles of agreement, an' daresn't, punish him. Be that so, Mr. Carvel?\\\"\\n\\nAs few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of Charles, James Fox and of John Paul Jones. The latter hero actually made a voyage, in the brigantine 'John' about the time he picked up Richard Carvel from, the Black Moll, after the episode with Mungo Maxwell at Tobago. The, Scotch scene, of course, is purely imaginary. Accuracy has been aimed at, in the account of the fight between the 'Bonhomme Richard' and the, 'Serapis', while a little different arrangement might have been better, for the medium of the narrative. To be sure, it was Mr. Mease, the, purser, instead of Richard Carvel, who so bravely fought the quarter-deck, guns; and in reality Midshipman Mayrant, Commodore Jones's aide, was, wounded by a pike in the thigh after the surrender. No injustice is done, to the second and third lieutenants, who were absent from the ship during, the action.\\n\\n\\\"You will cherish her, Richard,\\\" he said brokenly, \\\"for her like is not, to be found in this world. I knew her worth when first she came to, London, as arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance. I saw then that a, great love alone was needed to make her the highest among women, and from, the night I fought with you at the Coffee House I have felt upon whom, that love would fall. O thou of little faith,\\\" he cried, \\\"what little I, may have done has been for her. No, Richard, you do not deserve her, but, I would rather think of her as your wife than that of any man living.\\\"\\n\\nI cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after Mr. Swain's death., One hope had lightened all the years of my servitude. For, when I, examined my soul, I knew that it was for Dorothy I had laboured. And, every letter that came from Comyn telling me she was still free gave me, new heart for my work. By some mystic communion--I know not what--I felt, that she loved me yet, and despite distance and degree. I would wake of, a morning with the knowledge of it, and be silent for half the day with, some particle of a dream in my head, lingering like the burden of a song, with its train of memories.\\n\\nIn the meantime the American frigate 'Alliance' had brought Lafayette to, France, and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the, 'Bon homme Richard'. One of the most fatal mistakes Congress ever made, was to put Captain Pierre Landais in command of her, out of compliment to, the French allies. He was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to, get him a command in his own navy. His insulting conduct and treachery, to Captain Jones are strongly attested to in Mr. Carvel's manuscript:, they were amply proved by the written statements of other officers.\\n\\n\\\"A hawser, Mr. Stacey, a hawser!\\\" I heard the commodore shout, and saw, the sailing-master slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and, wounded and mass of broken spars and tackles, and finally pick up a, smeared rope's end, which I helped him drag to the poop. There we found, the commodore himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the, severed stays and shrouds dangling from the bowsprit, the French marines, looking on.\\n\\n\\\"No one knows of it, Richard, or is likely to. Dr. Barry, like so many, in England, is a good Whig and friend to America. And you are in a part, of London far removed from Mayfair.\\\" She hesitated, and then continued, in a voice that strove to be lighter: \\\"This little house is in Charlotte, Street, Mary-le-Bone, for the war has made all of us suffer some. And we, are more fortunate than many, for we are very comfortable here, and, though I say it, happier than in Arlington Street. And the best of our, friends are still faithful. Mr. Fox, with all his greatness, has never, deserted us, nor my Lord Comyn. Indeed, we owe them much more than I can, tell you of now,\\\" she said, and sighed. \\\"They are here every day of the, world to inquire for you, and it was his Lordship brought you out of, Holland.\\\"\\n\\nA master might picture my happiness, waking and sleeping, through the, short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light. The, memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe, a little more rounded, than of yore, and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the, world's mysteries. Dorothy had looked the lady in rags, and housewife's, cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades. When for any, reason she was absent from my side, I moped, to the quiet amusement of, Mrs. Manners and the more boisterous delight of Aunt Lucy, who took her, turn sewing in the window. I was near to forgetting the use of words\\n\\nNo one may read the annals of these men, who were at once brave and, courtly, and of these women, who were ladies by nature as well as by, birth, and not love them. The fascination of that free and hospitable, life has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it, with a genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to, the pleasure he has derived from the history of Maryland.\\n\\nThe squadron sailed from L'Orient in June, but owing to a collision, between the Bon homme Richard and the Alliance it was forced to put back, into the Groix roads for repairs. Nails and rivets were with difficulty, got to hold in the sides of the old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul, Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels:, Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve;, and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed, upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have, absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf, parted company, never to return. After the most outrageous conduct off, the coast of Ireland, Landais, in the 'Alliance', left the squadron on, September 6th, and did not reappear until the 23d, the day of the battle.\\n\\nBefore Christmas we went to the Eastern Shore. In Annapolis fife and, drum had taken the place of fiddle and clarion; militia companies were, drilling in the empty streets; despatches were arriving daily from the, North; and grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings. But if the war was, to come, I must settle what was to be done at Gordon's Pride with all, possible speed. It was only a few days after our going there, that I, rode into Oxford with a black cockade in my hat Patty had made me, and, the army sword Captain Jack had given Captain Daniel at my side. For I, had been elected a lieutenant in the Oxford company, of which Percy, Singleton was captain.\\n\\nI smiled, but more in sadness than amusement. Hardship had only degraded, Mr. Marmaduke the more, and even in trouble his memory was convenient as, is that of most people in prosperity. I was of no mind to jog his, recollection. But I wanted badly to ask about his Grace. Where had my, fine nobleman been at the critical point of his friend's misfortunes?, For I had had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk, with McAndrews.\\n\\n\\\"I came here to-night to betray you, and might have gone hence to your, uncle to claim my pieces of silver. I remain to tell you that Grafton, has an appointment at nine with his Majesty's chief Secretary of State., I need not mention his motives, nor dwell upon your peril. For the, King's sentiments toward Paul Jones are well known. You must leave, London without delay, and so must Mr. Manners and his family.\\\"\\n\\npresently to be pieced together. The injuries Mr. Marmaduke had done me, were the first to collect, since I was searching for the cause of my, resentment against him. The incidents arrived haphazard as magic, lanthorn views, but very vivid. His denial of me before Mr. Dix, and his, treachery at Vauxhall, when he had sent me to be murdered. Next I felt, myself clutching the skin over his ribs in Arlington Street, when I had, flung him across the room in his yellow night-gown. That brought me to, the most painful scene of my life, when I had parted with Dorothy at the, top of the stairs. Afterward followed scraps of the years at Gordon's, Pride, and on top of them the talk with McAndrews. Here was the secret, I sought. The crash had come. And they were no longer in Mayfair, but, must have taken a house in some poorer part of London. This thought cast, me down tremendously.\\n\\n\\\"Orchardson died before I had made one voyage,\\\" he replied, \\\"and the, Betsy changed owners. But I did not forget you, Richard, and was, resolved but now not to leave Maryland until I had seen you. But I burn, to hear of you,\\\" he added. \\\"I have had an inkling of your story from the, landlord. So your grandfather is dead, and that blastie, your uncle, of, whom you told me on the John, is in possession.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and, stripes over a man-o'-war. They got away on November 14, 1777, with a, fair crew and a poor lot of officers. Mr. Carvel had many a brush with, the mutinous first lieutenant Simpson. Family influence deterred the, captain from placing this man under arrest, and even Dr. Franklin found, trouble, some years after, in bringing about his dismissal from the, service. To add to the troubles, the Ranger proved crank and, slow-sailing; and she had only one barrel of rum aboard, which made, the men discontented.\\n\\nThose of us who had clung to hope lost it then. Standing with my back, to the mast, beating them off with a pike, visions of an English, prison-ship, of an English gallows, came before me. I counted the, seconds until the enemy's seamen would be pouring through our ragged, ports. The seventh and last time, and we were beaten, for we had not men, enough left on our two decks to force them down again. Yes,--I shame to, confess it--the heart went clean out of me, and with that the pain, pulsed and leaped in my head like a devil unbound. At a turn of the hand, I should have sunk to the boards, had not a voice risen strong and clear, above that turmoil, compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps.\\n\\n\\\"And now I shall tell you something of the story of the Duke of, Chartersea,\\\" she went on, and I felt her tremble as she spoke that name., \\\"I think of all we have Lord Comyn to thank for, next to saving your life, twice, was his telling you of the danger I ran. And, Richard, after, refusing you that day on the balcony over the Park, I had no hope left., You may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in London, after that. Richard,\\\" she said, \\\"do you recall my asking you in the, coach, on the way from Castle Yard, for the exact day you met my father, in Arlington Street?\\\"\\n\\nand then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet. For the old, archness, at least, would never be eradicated. Presently, after she had, taken the cup and smoothed my pillow, I reached out for her hand. It was, a boldness of which I had not believed myself capable; but she did not, resist, and even, as I thought, pressed my fingers with her own slender, ones, the red of our Maryland holly blushing in her cheeks. And what, need of words, indeed! Our thoughts, too, flew coursing hand in hand, through primrose paths, and the angels themselves were not to be envied.\\n\\n\\\"And I possessed the love of such a woman, Richard,\\\" he said, in another, tone, \\\"I think I should die of happiness. She will never tell you how, these weeks past she has scarce left your side. The threats combined, of her mother and the doctor, and Charles and me, would not induce her, to take any sleep. And time and time have I walked from here to Brook, Street without recognizing a step of the way, lifted clear out of myself, by the sight of her devotion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are always finding friends, Richard,\\\" said he; \\\"no matter what your, misfortunes, they are ever double discounted. As for me; I am like, Fulmer in Mr. Cumberland's 'West Indian': 'I have beat through every, quarter of the compass; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to, serve my country; I have'--I am engaging to betray it. No, Scotland is, no longer my country, and so I cannot betray her. It is she who has, betrayed me.\\\"\\n\\nMy own duties took me to the dark lower deck, a vile place indeed, and, reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals. There I had charge of, the battery of old eighteens, while Mr. Dale commanded the twelves on the, middle deck. We loaded our guns with two shots apiece, though I had my, doubts about their standing such a charge, and then the men stripped, until they stood naked to the waist, waiting for the fight to begin. For, we could see nothing of what was going forward. I was pacing up and, down, for it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the, gun-ports closed, when about three bells of the dog, Mr. Mease, the, purser, appeared on the ladder.\\n\\nThat the rough and bluff captains of the American service should have, regarded a man of Paul Jones's type with suspicion is not surprising., They resented his polish and accomplishments, and could not understand, his language. Perhaps it was for this reason, as well as a reward for, his brilliant services, that he was always given a separate command. In, the summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power, of the United States, nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate, 'Indien', then building at Amsterdam. And he was ordered to France in, command of the 'Ranger', a new ship then fitting at Portsmouth. Captain, Jones was the admiration of all the young officers in the navy, and was, immediately flooded with requests to sail with him. One of his first, acts, after receiving his command, was to apply to the Marine Committee, for Mr. Carvel. The favour was granted.\\n\\n\\\"We are not yet an infant state, sir,\\\" Mr. Carroll put in, with a shade, of rebuke. For Maryland was well content with the government she had, enjoyed, and her best patriots long after shunned the length of, secession. \\\"I believe and pray that the King will come to his senses., And as for the navy, it is folly. How can we hope to compete with, England on the sea?\\\"\\n\\nrolling his quid to show his pleasure of the topic, \\\"they sits on their, bottoms in Brest and L'Oriong an' talks takteek wi' their han's and, mouths, and daresn't as much as show the noses o' their three-deckers in, th' Bay o' Biscay, while Cap'n Jones pokes his bowsprit into every port, in England with a hulk the rats have left. I've had my bellyful o', Frenchies, Mr. Carvell save it be to fight 'em. An' I tell 'ee 'twould, give me the greatest joy in life t' leave loose 'Scolding Sairy' at that, there Landais. Th' gal ain't had a match on her this here cruise, an' t', my mind she couldn't be christened better, sir.\\\"\\n\\nThe boatswains' whistles trilled through the ship, pikes were seized, and, pistol and cutlass buckled on. But even as we waited with set teeth, our, bows ground into the enemy's weather quarter-gallery. For the Richard's, rigging was much cut away, and she was crank at best. So we backed and, filled once more, passing the Englishman close aboard, himself being, aback at the time. Several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in, front of me, shattering a nine-pounder and killing half of its crew. And, it is only a miracle that I stand alive to be able to tell the tale., Then I caught a glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our, wheel, and over went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the, 'Serapis', where we might rake and rush her decks. Our old Indiaman, answered but doggedly; and the huge bowsprit of the Serapis, towering, over our heads, snapped off our spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen, rigging.\\n\\nAs a result of that trip he got the Duras, which he renamed the 'Bon, homme Richard' in honour of Dr. Franklin. The Duras was an ancient, Indiaman with a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw, her, at the remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy. She was, perfectly rotten, and in the constructor's opinion not worth refitting., Her lowest deck (too low for the purpose) was pierced aft with three, ports on a side, and six worn-out eighteen-pounders mounted there. Some, of them burst in the action, killing their people. The main battery, on, the deck above, was composed of twenty-eight twelve-pounders. On the, uncovered deck eight nine-pounders were mounted. Captain Jones again, showed his desire to serve the cause by taking such a ship, and not, waiting for something better.\\n\\nmy old tutor, and rector of St. Anne's. And 'twas a baffling, intangible, change. 'Twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face, for he was now, just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul. The, coarse wine and coarse food of the lower coffee-houses of London had, replaced the rich and abundant fare of Maryland. The next day was become, one of the terrors of his life. His clothes were of poor stuff, but, aimed at the fashion. And yet--and yet, as I looked upon him, a, something was in his face to puzzle me entirely. I had seen many stamps, of men, but this thing I could not recognize.\\n\\n\\\"You will not believe him, Richard,\\\" cried my Lord; \\\"you have only to, look at him to see that he lies. Take note of the ragged uniform of the, rebel army he carries, and then think of him 'en petite maitre', with his, cabriolet and his chestnuts. Egad, he might be as rich as Rigby were it, not for those principles which he chooses to deride. And I have seen him, reduced to a crown for them. I tell you, Richard,\\\" said my Lord, \\\"by, espousing your cause Charles is become greater than the King. For he, has the hearts of the English people, which George has not, and the, allegiance of you Americans, which George will never have. And if you, once heard him, in Parliament, you should hear him now, and see the, Speaker wagging his wig like a man bewitched, and hear friends and, enemies calling out for him to go on whenever he gives the sign of a, pause.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ill uncos, sir,\\\" he answered, shaking his head with violence. He had, indeed but a sorry tale for my ear, and one to make my heart heavier than, it was. McAndrews opened his mind to me, and seemed the better for it., How Mr. Marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was, more than the honest Scotchman could imagine. There was a country place, in Sussex now, said he, that was the latest. And drafts were coming in, before the wheat was in the ear; and the plantations of tobacco on the, Western Shore had been idle since the non-exportation, and were mortgaged, to their limit to Mr. Willard. Money was even loaned on the Wilmot House, estate. McAndrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither Mrs. Manners nor, Miss Dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs.\\n\\n\\\"Now, and never again, dear,\\\" she said. \\\"Yes, I saw and heard all that, passed in the drawing-room. And I did not blame, but praised you for it., I have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since. God, forgive me!\\\" she cried, \\\"but I have despised him from that hour. When, I knew that he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute, working, upon me to save his honour, of which he has not the smallest spark; that, he had recognized and denied you, friendless before our house, and sent, you into the darkness at Vauxhall to be murdered, then he was no father, of mine. I would that you might know what my mother has suffered from, such a man, Richard.\\\"\\n\\nIf the divine power of genius ever made itself felt, 'twas on that May, evening, at candle-light, in the Annapolis Coffee House. With my own, eyes I witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province, thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight, and twenty. As for good Captain Daniel, enthusiasm is but a poor word to, express his feelings. A map was sent for and spread out upon the table., And it was a late hour when Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll went home\\n\\nThe author makes most humble apologies to any who have, or think they, have, an ancestor in this book. He has drawn the foregoing with a very, free hand, and in the Maryland scenes has made use of names rather than, of actual personages. His purpose, however poorly accomplished, was to, give some semblance of reality to this part of the story. Hence he has, introduced those names in the setting, choosing them entirely at random, from the many prominent families of the colony.\\n\\nThey were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking, hatches, and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a, desperate vigour. Then, all at once, the towering mainmast of the enemy, cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds., The first intense silence of the battle followed, in the midst of which, came a cry from our top:\\n\\nNor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the Atlantic., We reached Lisbon in safety, and after a week of lodgings in that city by, the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for Baltimore. For, the Chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war, and kept alive the, credit of the young nation. There were many excitements ere we sighted, the sand-spits of Virginia, and off the Azores we were chased for a day, and a night by a British sloop of war. Our captain, however, was a cool, man and a seaman, and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the, Capes very triumphantly.\\n\\n\\\"What plan, sir!\\\" said Captain John Paul, those wonderful eyes of his, alight. \\\"In the first place, we Americans build the fastest ships in the, world,--yours of the Chesapeake are as fleet as any. Here, if I am not, mistaken, one hundred and eighty-two were built in the year '71. They, are idle now. To them I would issue letters of marque, to harry, England's trade. From Carolina to Maine we have the wood and iron to, build cruisers, in harbours that may not easily be got at. And skilled, masters and seamen to elude the enemy.\\\"\\n\\nMy heart bled for him. Some minutes passed that he did not speak, making, shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by, a strong emotion. \\\"'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was, greatest. Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles, in his coat, and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on, since Dolly and he and I had stood together on the Betsy's deck.\\n\\nWhen next consciousness came, the tarry, salt smell of a ship was in my, nostrils, and I knew that we were embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a, fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and, the tramp of feet on the deck above my head. Framed against the, irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water, beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.\\n\\nand the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead. At last, when I, was getting fairly restless, the distant tones of a voice, deep and, reverberating, smote upon my ear, jarring painfully some long-forgotten, chord. That voice belonged to but one man alive, and yet I could not, name him. Even as I strained, the tones drew nearer, and they were mixed, with sweeter ones I knew well, and Dorothy's mother's voice. Whilst I, was still searching, the door opened, the voices fell calm, and Dorothy, came in bearing a candle in each hand. As she set them down on the, table, I saw an agitation in her face, which she strove to hide as she, addressed me.\\n\\nThe scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning. A knot of, midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing Landais's conduct, and, cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up, short. Mr. Stacey, the sailing-master, had the deck, and the coasting, pilot was conning; now and anon the boatswain's whistle piped for Garrett, or Quito or Fogg to lay aft to the mast, where the first lieutenant stood, talking to Colonel de Chamillard, of the French marines. The scavengers, were sweeping down, and part of the after guard was bending a new, bolt-rope on a storm staysail.\\n\\nMr. Carvel's chapter opens with Landais's sudden reappearance on the, morning of the day the battle was fought. He shows the resentment and, anger against the Frenchman felt by all on board, from cabin-boy to, commodore. But none went so far as to accuse the captain of the, 'Alliance' of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action., Cowardice may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from, the two duels in which the Richard and the Pallas engaged. But the fact, that he poured broadsides into the Richard, and into her off side, makes, it seem probable that his motive was to sink the commodore's ship, and so, get the credit of saving the day, to the detriment of the hero who won it, despite all disasters. To account for the cry that was raised when first, she attacked the Richard, it must be borne in mind that the crew of the, 'Alliance' was largely composed of Englishmen. It was thought that these, had mutinied and taken her.\\n\\nAt noon, when I relieved Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun had eaten up the, fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming, up across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind, us. I had the starboard watch piped to dinner, and reported twelve, o'clock to the commodore. And had just got permission to \\\"make it,\\\", according to a time-honoured custom at sea, when another \\\"Sail, ho!\\\" came, down from aloft.\\n\\n\\\"Charles,\\\" I said, \\\"this is all of a piece with your old recklessness., You were ever one to take any risk, but I will not hear of such a venture, as this. Do you think I will allow the hope of all England to be staked, for a pirate? And would you break our commander of her rank? All that, Dorothy need do at Portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she, meets, and I'll warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain,\\\" I said to my old friend, \\\"I have a rare joy this day in making, known to you Mr. John Paul Jones, of whom I have spoken to you a score of, times. He it is whose bravery sank the Black Moll, whose charity took me, to London, and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in, a debtors' prison. For his honour, as I have told you, would allow him, to accept none, nor his principles to take the commission in the Royal, Navy which Mr. Fox offered him.\\\"\\n\\nThe room had a prodigious sense of change about it. That came over me, with something of a shock, since the moment before I had it settled that, I was in Marlboro' Street. The bare branches swaying in the wind outside, should belong to the trees in Freshwater Lane. But beyond the branches, were houses, the like of which I had no remembrance of in Annapolis. And, then my grandfather should be sitting in that window. Surely, he was, there! He moved! He was coming toward me to say: \\\"Richard, you are, forgiven,\\\" and to brush his eyes with his ruffles.\\n\\nShe closed the door softly behind her, and stood looking down upon me, with such a wondrous love-light in her eyes as no man may describe., My fancy had not lifted me within its compass, my dreams even had not, imagined it. And the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler, souls. So she stood gazing, those lips which once had been the seat of, pride now parted in a smile of infinite tenderness. But her head she, still held high, and her body straight. Down the front of her dress fell, a tucked apron of the whitest linen, and in her hand was a cup of, steaming broth.\\n\\nmy dear. Well, when the big British fleet sailed up the bay in '77, your, precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality., He began to correspond with the British at Philadelphia, and one of his, letters was captured near the Head of Elk. A squad was sent to the Kent, estate, where he had been living, to arrest him, but he made his escape, to New York. And his lands were at once confiscated by the state.\\\"\\n\\nBringing the official news of Burgoyne's surrender, which was to cause, King Louis to acknowledge the independence of the United States, the, Ranger arrived at Nantes, December 2. Mr. Carvel accompanied Captain, Jones to Paris, where a serious blow awaited him. The American, Commissioners informed him that the Indien had been transferred to France, to prevent her confiscation. That winter John Paul spent striving in, vain for a better ship, and imbibing tactics from the French admirals., Incidentally, he obtained a salute for the American flag. The cruise of, the Ranger in English waters the following spring was a striking, fulfilment, with an absurdly poor and inadequate force, of the plan set, forth by John Paul Jones in the Annapolis Coffee House. His descent upon, Whitehaven spread terror and consternation broadcast through England, and, he was branded as a pirate and a traitor. Mr. Carvel was fortunately not, of the landing party on St. Mary's Isle, which place he had last beheld, in John Paul's company, on the brigantine John, when entering, Kirkcudbright. The object of that expedition, as is well known, was to, obtain the person of the Earl of Selkirk, in order to bring about the, rescue of the unfortunate Americans suffering in British prisons. After, the celebrated capture of the sloop-of-war Drake, Paul Jones returned to, France a hero.\\n\\nAll that morning I pondered over the devious lane of my life, which had, led up to so fair a garden. And one thing above all kept turning and, turning in my head, until I thought I should die of waiting for its, fulfilment. Now was I free to ask Dorothy to marry me, to promise her, the ease and comfort that had once been hers, should God bring us safe, back to Maryland. The change in her was little less than a marvel to me\\n\\n\\\"'Ods! Blest if I know what he is,\\\" says Mr. Claude. \\\"He may be, anything, an impostor or a high-mightiness. But he's something to strike, the eye and hold it, for all his Quaker clothes. He is swarth and, thickset, and some five feet eight inches--full six inches under your, own height. And he comes asking for you as if you owned the town between, you. 'Send a fellow to Marlboro' Street for Mr. Richard Carvel, my good, host!' says he, with a snap of his fingers. And when I tell him the news, of you, he is prodigiously affected, and cries--but here's my gentleman, now!\\\"\\n\\nI arrived at Wye Island in season to dine with the good judge and his, family, and there I made over to his charge the property of Patty and her, mother. The afternoon we spent in sober talk, Mr. Bordley giving me much, sound advice, and writing me several letters of recommendation to, gentlemen in Congress. His conduct was distinguished by even more of, kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me.\\n\\n\\\"I could answer nothing. 'Twas because of her father's dying wish I, asked her, and she guessed that same. I would not tell her a lie, for, only the one woman lives whom I love, and whom I have loved ever since, we were children together among the strawberries. Need I say that that, woman is you, Dorothy? I loved you before we sailed to Carvel Hall, between my grandfather's knees, and I will love you till death claims, me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he followed Mrs. Manners out of the room, frowning and shaking his, fist at me in mock fierceness. I would have died for the man. For a, space--a prodigious long space--I lay very still, my heart bumping like a, gun-carriage broke loose, and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door., Then I caught the sound of a light footstep, the knob turned, and joy, poured into my soul with the sweep of a Fundy tide.\\n\\nOur men raised a hoarse yell, drowned all at once by the popping of, musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about, the decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to, larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the, space between the ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports., And next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them, muzzle to muzzle below, our rammers leaning into the Serapis to send, their shot home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us, in moments of suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce, to leap a cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the, English guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign\\n\\nwhich I saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort. And I, was made to take a spoonful of something. Never, I believe, was medicine, swallowed with a greater willingness. Talk was impossible, so I lay back, in the corner and looked at her; and now and anon she would glance at my, face, with a troubled guess in her own as to how I might stand the night., For we were still in London. That I knew by the trot of our horses, and, by the granite we traversed from time to time. But at length we rumbled, over a bridge, there was a sharp call back from our post-boy to him of, the chaise behind, and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying, and creaking, which was to last the whole night long, save for the brief, stops at the post-houses.\\n\\nThe rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme, Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck. Less than three score, of the seamen were American born; near four score were British, inclusive, of sixteen Irish; one hundred and thirty-seven were French soldiers, who, acted as marines; and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight, her were from all over the earth,--Malays and Maltese and Portuguese., In the hold were more than one hundred and fifty English prisoners.\\n\\ntoo, for now am I known from Mary-le-bone to Chelsea, while before my, name was unheard of out of little Mayfair. Indeed, I would not have, missed the experience for a lady-in-waiting-ship. I have learned a deal, since I saw you last, sir. I know that the world, like our Continental, money, must not be taken for the price that is stamped upon it. And as, for the watching with you,\\\" said my lady, \\\"that had to be borne with as, cheerfully as might be. Since I had sent off for you, I was in duty, bound to do my share toward your recovery. I was even going to add, that this watching was a pleasure,--our curate says the sense of duty, performed is sure to be. But you used to cry out the most terrifying, things to frighten me: the pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies, on the decks, and the black rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never, stopped; and strange, rough commands I could not understand; and the name, of your commodore whom you love so much. And often you would repeat over, and over: 'I have not yet begun, to fight, I have not yet begun to, fight!'\\\"\\n\\nThen there was the bed-canopy, the pleatings of which were gone, and it, was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That, was unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the, mantel was now but a bit of a shelf, and held many things that seemed, scarce at home on the rough and painted wood,--gold filigree; and China, and Japan, and a French clock that ought not to have been just there., Ah, the teacups! Here at last was something to touch a fibre of my, brain, but a pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back, to my grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as, Scipio's, and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too, large for him. And he was sewing. This was monstrous!\\n\\nI turned and followed him aft to the taffrail, where we were clear of the, French soldiers. The sun was hanging red over the Yorkshire Wolds, the, Head of Flamborough was in the blue shadow, and the clouds were like rose, leaves in the sky. The enemy had tacked and was standing west, with, ensign and jack and pennant flying, the level light washing his sails to, the whiteness of paper. 'Twas then I first remarked that the Alliance, had left her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the, Serapis. The commodore seemed to read my exclamation.\\n\\nI turned my face to the wall, completely overcome, and the tears scalding, in my eyes, at the thought of Dorothy and her mother bending over the, stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood, and watching at my bedside, night and day despite their weariness of body. And not a word out of, these noble women of their sacrifice, nor of the shame and trouble and, labour of their lives, who always had been used to every luxury! Nothing, but cheer had they brought to the sickroom, and not a sign of their, poverty and hardship, for they knew that their broths and biscuit and, jellies must have choked me. No. It remained for this contemptible, cur of a husband and father to open my eyes.\\n\\nstriking everywhere, sometimes sending casks of salt water over the, nettings. Incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering, sand over the black pools that kept running, running together as the, minutes were tolled out, and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces, in a hideous contortion. One little fellow, with whom I had had many a, lively word at mess, had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went, skipping past me with the charge under his coat, and I have but to listen, now to hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him, away to the cockpit below. Out of the main hatch, from that charnel, house, rose one continuous cry. It was an odd trick of the mind or soul, that put a hymn on my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human, misery, when men were calling the name of their Maker in vain. But as, I ran from crew to crew, I sang over and over again a long-forgotten, Christmas carol, and with it came a fleeting memory of my mother on the, stairs at Carvel Hall, and of the negroes gathered on the lawn without.\\n\\nI knew full well she meant it, and the terror of losing her kept me, silent. She put down the cup, placed another pillow behind my head with, a marvellous deftness, and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls, something which was surely nectar. And mine eyes, too, had their feast., Never before had I seen my lady in this gentle guise, this task of, nursing the sick, which her doing raised to a queenly art.\\n\\nSo passed that winter, the darkest of my life. One soft spring day, when, the birds were twittering amid new-born leaves, and the hyacinths and, tulips in Patty's garden were coming to their glory, Master Tom rode, leisurely down the drive at Gordon's Pride. That was a Saturday, the, 29th of April, 1775. The news which had flown southward, night and day, alike, was in no hurry to run off his tongue; he had been lolling on the, porch for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the, minute-men of Massachusetts and the British regulars, of the rout of, Percy's panting redcoats from Concord to Boston. Tom added, with the, brutal nonchalance which characterized his dealings with his mother and, sister, that he was on his way to Philadelphia to join a company.\\n\\nThe next morning, after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me, to his heart's content, enters Mr. Marmaduke Manners. I was prodigiously, struck by the change in him, and pitied him then near as much as I had, once despised him. He was arrayed in finery, as of old. But the finery, was some thing shabby; the lace was frayed at the edges, there was a neat, but obvious patch in his small-clothes, and two more in his coat. His, air was what distressed me most of all, being that of a man who spends, his days seeking favours and getting none. I had seen too many of the, type not to know the sign of it.\\n\\nto put in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once, visited. And how much of that money do you suppose I get, sir? Will you, believe it that I--\\\" (he was shrieking now), \\\"that I, the man of the, family, am allowed only my simple meals, a farthing for snuff, and not a, groat for chaise-hire? At my age I am obliged to walk to and from their, lordships' side entrances in patched clothes, egad, when a new suit might, obtain us a handsome year's income!\\\"\\n\\nWe were married on the fifteenth of June, already an anniversary for us, both, in the long drawing-room. General Clapsaddle was there from the, army to take Dorothy in his arms, even as he had embraced another bride, on the same spot in years gone by. She wore the wedding gown that was, her mother's, but when the hour was come to dress her Aunt Lucy and Aunt, Hester failed in their task, and it was Patty who performed the most of, that office, and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck.\\n\\nAt that the commodore hurried forward, the men falling back to the, bulwarks respectfully, and he mounted the fore-rigging as agile as any, topman, followed by his aide with a glass. From the masthead he sung out, to me to set our stu'nsails, and he remained aloft till near seven bells, of the watch. At that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety, behind the head, and from the deck a great yellow King's frigate could be, plainly seen standing south to meet us, followed by her smaller consort., Presently she hove to, and through our glasses we discerned a small boat, making for her side, and then a man clambering up her sea-ladder.\\n\\nIt makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that, tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the, King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that, stood so straight upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love, and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns, piped and sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the, long roll and the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive., Breechings were loosed and gun-tackles unlashed, rammer and sponge laid, out, and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy, when the time came to rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled, over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and, canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers, rigged the splinter nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes, against those that were sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of, water to put out the fires. Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is, slippery upon the boards. The French marines, their scarlet and white, very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were, mustered on poop and forecastle, and some were sent aloft to the tops to, assist the tars there to sweep the British decks with handgrenade and, musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and, steerage, to make ready for the grimmest work of all.\\n\\nI rushed back to my guns, for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of, the Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into, play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside, into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching, together, the disordered riggings locking, and both pointed northward to, a leeward tide in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to, shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.\\n\\n\\\"The duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to London., I think my father wrote of that to Dr. Courtenay.\\\" (I smiled at the, recollection, now.) \\\"Then his Grace persisted in following me, everywhere, and vowed publicly that he would marry me. I ordered him, from our house, since my father would not. At last one afternoon he came, back to dine with us, insolent to excess. I left the table. He sat with, my father two hours or more, drinking and singing, and giving orders to, the servants. I shut my door, that I might not hear. After a while my, mother came up to me, crying, saying that Mr. Manners would be branded, with dishonour and I did not consent to marry his Grace,--a most terrible, dishonour, of which she could not speak. That the duke had given my, father a month to win my consent. And that month was up, Richard, the, very afternoon you appeared with Mr. Dix in Arlington Street.\\\"\\n\\ninstead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and, prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen, gibberish of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the, first fury of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn, at the main hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had, burst, killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them., At this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches.\\n\\nbe accused of mercenary motives. The ragged crew of the Ranger was paid, in part out of his own pocket, and for a whole month he supported the, Drake's officers and men, no provision having been made for prisoners., He was at large expense in fitting out the Ranger, and he bought back at, twice what it was worth the plate taken from St. Mary's Isle, getting but, a tardy recognition from the Earl of Selkirk for such a noble and, unheard-of action. And, I take pride in writing it, Mr. Carvel spent, much of what he had earned at Gordon's Pride in a like honourable manner.\\n\\n\\\"Richard,\\\" replied he, with an ineffable sadness, \\\"I am naught but a, wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,--no, real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom, I lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life, I must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I know that, now, and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently, broken forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a wild young creature then, my dear, with little beside vanity, under my cap. And the notion that you could admire and love any girl but, me was beyond endurance. Then his Lordship arrived in England, brimming, with praise of you, to assure me that the affair was not about Patty at, all. This was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love, with her, and I may say now that I was miserable. Then, as we were, setting out for Castle Howard, came the news of your death on the road, to Upper Marlboro. I could not go a step. Poor Jack, he was very honest, when he proposed,\\\" she added, with a sigh.\\n\\nIt was Aunt Lucy who spent the morning with me, and Mrs. Manners brought, my dinner. I observed a questioning glance as she entered, which I took, for an attempt to read whether Mr. Marmaduke had spoke more than he, ought. But I would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my, discoveries, though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern., She stayed to talk on the progress of the war, relating the gallant, storming of Stony Point by Mad Anthony in July, and the latest Tory, insurrection on our own Eastern Shore. She passed from these matters to, a discussion of General Washington's new policy of the defensive, for, Mrs. Manners had always been at heart a patriot. And whilst I lay, listening with a deep interest, in comes my lady herself. So was it, ever, when you least expected her, even as Mammy had said. She curtseyed, very prettily, with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red, and asked me, how I did.\\n\\nRichard. You must have seen even then that I loved you, dear, though, I was so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his Grace. I could not, bear to think that you knew of any stain upon our family. I think--I, think I would rather have died, or have married him. That day I threw, Chartersea's presents out of the window, but my father made the servants, gather them all which escaped breaking, and put them in the drawing-room., Then I fell ill.\\\"\\n\\nAfter an hour of it, I was holding my breath against the lurches, like a, sea-sick man against that bottomless fall of the ship's bows on the, ocean. I had no pain,--only an over whelming exhaustion,--but the joy, of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy, dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary, twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning, ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic; or, reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of, that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous, of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort\\n\\nhis successful elusions of the 'Cerberus', which hounded him, and his, escape from the 'Solebay', are too famous to be dwelt upon here., Obtaining the Alfred, he captured and brought into Boston ten thousand, suits of uniform for Washington's shivering army. Then, by the bungling, of Congress, thirteen officers were promoted over his head. The, bitterness this act engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for, distinction was as great as Captain Jones's may be imagined. To his, everlasting credit be it recorded that he remained true to the country to, which he had dedicated his life and his talents. And it was not until, 1781 that he got the justice due him.\\n\\nWe had now but one of our starboard nine-pounders on its carriage, and, word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to, scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, we did, not have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away, for, the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy', from her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the, bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of, sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and, shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull\\n\\nTo us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay., Seven times, I say, was that battle lost, and seven times regained again., What was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their, posts through that hell of flame and shot, when a madman could scarce, have hoped for victory? What but the knowledge that somewhere in the, swirl above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept, all obstacles from before him, and into whose mind the thought of defeat, could not enter. His spirit held us to our task, for flesh and blood, might not have endured alone.\\n\\nand bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet, were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound, her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the, while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew, around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress, for the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her, muff and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs, of failure.\\n\\n\\\"I would never meet it, sir,\\\" he replied instantly. \\\"That would be the, height of folly. I would divide our forces into small, swift-sailing, squadrons, of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers. And I would, carry the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade. I can name, a score of such defenceless places, and I know every shoal of their, harbours. For example, Whitehaven might be entered. That is a town of, fifty thousand inhabitants. The fleet of merchantmen might with the, greatest ease be destroyed, a contribution levied, and Ireland's coal cut, off for a winter. The whole of the shipping might be swept out of the, Clyde. Newcastle is another likely place, and in almost any of the Irish, ports valuable vessels may be found. The Baltic and West Indian fleets, are to be intercepted. I have reflected upon these matters for years\\n\\nwhatever the pain they give. And my heart aches now when I think of that, dark day in Arlington Street when I gave you the locket, and you went out, of my life. I knew that I had done wrong then, Richard, as soon as ever, the door closed behind you. I should have gone with you, for better for, worse, for richer for poorer. I should have run after you in the rain, and thrown myself at your feet. And that would have been best for my, father and for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe Serapis, too, was now beginning to blaze aloft, and choking, wood-smoke eddied out of the Richard's hold and mingled with the powder, fumes. Then the enemy's fire abreast us seemed to lull, and Mr. Stacey, mounted the bulwarks, and cried out: \\\"You have cleared their decks, my, hearties!\\\" Aloft, a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the, very top of the Englishman, where he threw a hand-grenade, as I thought\\n\\nthat this was the man of whose innermost life I had had so intimate a, view. Who had taken me to the humble cottage under Criffel, who had, poured into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together, in the dingy room of the Castle Yard sponging-house. Then some of those, ludicrous scenes on the road to London came up to me, for which the, sky-blue frock was responsible. And yet this commodore was not greatly, removed from him I had first beheld on the brigantine John. His, confidence in his future had not so much as wavered since that day. That, future was now not so far distant as the horizon, and he was ready to, meet it.\\n\\nmerciful or cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act, of coolness and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a, gunner called for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch, the rammer from Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot, through his chest. Poor Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work, 'Scolding Sairy' was to do that night. I had but dragged him beyond, reach of the recoil when he was gone.\\n\\n\\\"To speak truth, I am heartily tired of that life,\\\" said he. \\\"There is, little glory in raising nicotia, and sipping bumbo, and cursing negroes., Ho for the sea!\\\" he cried. \\\"The salt sea, and the British prizes. Give, me a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake. Mark me, Richard,\\\" he, said, a restless gleam coning into his dark eyes, \\\"stirring times are, here, and a chance for all of us to make a name.\\\" For so it seemed ever, to be with him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I am speaking the truth,\\\" he said bitterly. \\\"And I assume no virtue, for the little justice it remains in my power to do. It is the lot of my, life that I must be false to some one always, and even now I am false to, your uncle. Yes, I am come to do justice, and 'tis a strange errand for, me. I know that estates have been restored to you by the Maryland, Legislature, Richard, and I believe in my heart that you will win this, war.\\\" Here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket. \\\"But to make you, secure,\\\" said he, \\\"in the year 1710, and on the 9th of March, old style\\n\\n\\\"I do not tell you that I shall change my life, Richard, for I have said, that too many times before. Indeed, I warn you that any money you may, send will be spent in drink, and--and worse. I will be no hypocrite to, you. But I believe that I am better this hour than I have been since, last I knelt at my mother's knee in the little Oxfordshire cottage where, I was born.\\\"\\n\\nDazed, I put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet. When I, had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for the very notion of, that cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in, his own temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that, panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the, ring-bolts of its companion that lay shattered there. \\\"Serve her with, double-headed, my lads,\\\" he shouted, \\\"and every shot into the, Englishman's mainmast!\\\"\\n\\nand set off at the devil's pace for the Texel. You must know that the, whole Dutch nation was in an uproar--as much of an uproar as those boors, ever reach--over the arrival of your infamous squadron. The Court Party, and our ambassador were for having you kicked out, and the Republicans, for making you at home. I heard that their High Mightinesses had given, Paul Jones the use of the Texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners\\n\\nNot until October of that year, 1775, was the infant navy born. Mr., Carvel was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical, seamanship and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of, instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon, the character of that hero by the fact that, with all his supreme, confidence in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first, lieutenancy. This was in deference to the older men before that body., \\\"I hoped,\\\" said he, \\\"in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from, those of more experience than myself.\\\" His lack of assertion for once, cost him dear. He sailed on the New Providence expedition under, Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon, discovered that, instead of gaining information, he was obliged to inform, others. He trained the men so thoroughly in the use of the great guns, \\\"that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as, soldiers generally perform the manual exercise.\\\"\\n\\nwhen I remembered the wilful miss who had come to London bent upon, pleasure alone. Truly, she was of that rare metal which refines, and, then outshines all others. And there was much I could not understand., A miracle had saved her from the Duke of Chartersea, but why she had, refused so many great men and good was beyond my comprehension. Not a, glimpse of her did I get that day, though my eyes wandered little from, the knob of the door. And even from Aunt Lucy no satisfaction was to be, had as to the cause of her absence.\\n\\n'Twas at this critical moment, when that fearful battle once more was, won, another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads, and that, name which we dreaded most of all was spread again. As we halted in, consternation, a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side, and, a babel of voices hailed the treacherous Landais with oaths and, imprecations. We made out the Alliance with a full head of canvas, black, and sharp, between us and the moon. Smoke hung above her rail. Getting, over against the signal fires blazing on Flamborough Head, she wore ship, and stood across our bows, the midshipman on the forecastle singing out, to her, by the commodore's orders, to lay the enemy by the board. There, was no response.\\n\\nI hurried over to the tea-cups, such a twinge did that discovery give me., But they troubled me near as much, and the sea-coal fire held strange, images. The fascination in the window was not to be denied, for it stood, in line with the houses and the trees. Suddenly there rose up before me, a gate. Yes, I knew that gate, and the girlish figure leaning over it., They were in Prince George Street. Behind them was a mass of golden-rose, bushes, and out of these came forth a black face under a turban, saying\\n\\n\\\"Ay, that he is, with our English cruisers thick as gulls outside', waiting for a dead fish. But he has spurned the French commission they, have offered him, saying that of the Congress is good enough for him., And he declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the, Alliance under the Stars and Stripes. And for this I honour him,\\\" added, he, \\\"and Charles honours him, and so must all Englishmen honour him when, they come to their senses. And by Gads life, I believe he will get, clear, for he is a marvel at seamanship.\\\"\\n\\nand worn themselves out with nursing me. Nor did I forget the risk they, ran with such a guest. For the first time in many years my heart, relented toward Mr. Marmaduke. For their sakes I forgave him over and, over what I had suffered, and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon, me. And how was I to repay them? They needed the money I had cost them\",\n          \", [This is the last letter which I was destined to receive from my poor, friend. He started to spend the Christmas of that year (1884) with his, people, and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident, at Sittingfleet, where the express ran into a freight train which was, standing in the depot. Dr. and Mrs. Munro were the only occupants of, the car next the locomotive, and were killed instantly, as were the, brakesman and one other passenger. It was such an end as both he and, his wife would have chosen; and no one who knew them would regret that, neither was left to mourn the other. His insurance policy of eleven, hundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own, family, which, as his father was sick, was the one worldly matter which, could have caused him concern.--H. S.]\\n\\nI told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious, return from Lochtully Castle. When I had settled for the flannel vests, which my mother had ordered so lavishly I had only five pounds left out, of my pay. With this, as it was the first money that I had ever earned, im{sic} my life, I bought her a gold bangle, so behold me reduced at, once to my usual empty pocketed condition. Well, it was something just, to feel that I HAD earned money. It gave me an assurance that I might, again.\\n\\nGood-bye, old chap, and never think that I forget you. Your letters are, read and re-read with avidity. I think I have every line you ever wrote, me. You simply knock Paley out every time. I am so glad that you got out, of that brewery business all right. For a time I was really afraid that, you must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares. I can, only thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques.\\n\\n\\\"A million pounds. Not a penny under. And dirt cheap to the nation that, buys it. I shall let it go at that, though I could make ten times as, much if I held on. I shall take it up to the Secretary of the Navy in, a week or two; and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person I, shall do business with him. It's not every day, Munro, that a man comes, into his office with the Atlantic under one arm and the Pacific under, the other. Eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nSince I am upon this topic, may I say just a little more without boring, you? You say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive, and that, I have nothing to offer in place of what I pull down. This is not quite, correct. I think that there are certain elemental truths within our, grasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance, and which are, sufficient to furnish us with a practical religion, having so much of, reason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold, not drive, them forth from it.\\n\\nfrom all I can learn of him, has suddenly swung clean over from one, extreme of character to the other. Every plus has in an instant become a, minus. He's another man, but in the same case. I am told that he used, to be (only a few months ago, mind you) most fastidious in dress, and speech. Now he is a foul-tongued rough! He had a nice taste in, literature. Now he stares at you if you speak of Shakespeare. Queerest, of all, he used to be a very high-and-dry Tory in his opinions. He, is fond now of airing the most democratic views, and in a needlessly, offensive way. When I did get on terms with him at last, I found that, there was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on, politics. In substance, I am bound to say that I think his new views are, probably saner than his old ones, but the insanity lies in his sudden, reasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech.\\n\\nYou know that you are turning up your nose at me, Bertie. I can see you, do it. But I'll come off the thin ice, and you shall have nothing but, facts now. I'm afraid that I should never do for a story-teller, for the, first stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me, off, with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me.\\n\\nYou'll laugh, Bertie, but it was no laughing matter to me. He wanted, eight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either, had or had not done. Otherwise the company would remove the gas-meter., How little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting, to me was either to pay away more than half my capital, or to give up, cooking my food! I at last appeased him by a promise that I should look, into the matter, and so escaped for the moment, badly shaken but still, solvent. He gave me a good deal of information about the state of his, tubes (his own, not the gas company's) before he departed; but I had, rather lost interest in the subject since I had learned that he was, being treated by his club doctor.\\n\\nWho do you think was the first person who broke this spell of, silence? The ruffian whom I had fought under the lamp-post. He is a, scissors-grinder it seems, and rang to know if I had a job for him. I, could not help grinning at him when I opened the door and saw who it, was. He showed no sign of recognising me, however, which is hardly to be, wondered at.\\n\\nthat years ago the name of Bradfield used to strike with a causeless, familiarity upon my ear; and since then, as you know, the course of my, life has flowed through it. And so when I first saw Winnie La Force in, the railway carriage, before I had spoken to her or knew her name, I, felt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her. Have you had, no experience of the sort in your life? Or was it merely that she was, obviously gentle and retiring, and so made a silent claim upon all that, was helpful and manly in me? At any rate, I was conscious of it; and, again and again every time that I met her. How good is that saying of, some Russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole, sex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand! I thought I, knew something of women. I suppose every medical student does. But now I, can see that I really knew nothing. My knowledge was all external. I did, not know the woman soul, that crowning gift of Providence to man, which\\n\\nshe runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a, household word, and they all pretend to sympathise with her, and, agree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man. I, quarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct, and it ended, by my throwing him down the stairs. What was the result? He talked so, much about it that the whole village from which he came, sick and, well, trooped to see me. The little country practitioner who had been, buttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well, put up his shutters. It's human nature, my boy, and you can't alter it., Eh, what? You make yourself cheap and you become cheap. You put a high, price on yourself and they rate you at that price. Suppose I set up in, Harley Street to-morrow, and made it all nice and easy, with hours from, ten to three, do you think I should get a patient? I might starve first., How would I work it? I should let it be known that I only saw patients, from midnight until two in the morning, and that bald-headed people, must pay double. That would set people talking, their curiosity would, be stimulated, and in four months the street would be blocked all night., Eh, what? laddie, you'd go yourself. That's my principle here. I often, come in of a morning and send them all about their business, tell them, I'm going off to the country for a day. I turn away forty pounds, and, it's worth four hundred as an advertisement!\\\"\\n\\nWell, this made me sit down and gasp. I am, I think, one of the most, unsuspicious men upon earth, and through a certain easy-going indolence, of disposition I never even think of the possibility of those with whom, I am brought in contact trying to deceive me. It does not occur to me., But let me once get on that line of thought--let me have proof that, there is reason for suspicion--and then all faith slips completely away, from me. Now I could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at, Bradfield. Those sudden fits of ill temper, the occasional ill-concealed, animosity of Cullingworth--did they not mark the arrival of each of, my mother's letters? I was convinced that they did. He had read them, then--read them from the pockets of the little house coat which I used, to leave carelessly in the hall when I put on my professional one to go, out. I could remember, for example, how at the end of his illness his, manner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my, mother's had arrived. Yes, it was certain that he had read them from the, beginning.\\n\\nThe time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this; but, we gradually whittled it down to five and to four. My income had risen, to about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time; and Winnie had, agreed, with a somewhat enigmatical smile, that we could manage very, well on that--the more so as marriage sends a doctor's income up. The, reason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that, date I received a most portentous blue document in which \\\"We, Brown, & Woodhouse, the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned, Winifred La Force, do hereby\\\"--state a surprising number of things\\n\\nNow about the Cullingworths. Madam is as amiable as ever; and yet, somehow, unless I am deceiving myself, she has changed somewhat of late, in her feelings towards me. I have turned upon her suddenly more than, once, and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than, malignant. In one or two small matters I have also detected a hardness, in her which I had never observed before. Is it that I have intruded, too much into their family life? Have I come between the husband and the, wife? Goodness knows I have striven with all my little stock of tact to, avoid doing so. And yet I have often felt that my position was a false, one. Perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a woman's, glances and gestures. He wishes to assign a definite meaning to each\\n\\nTo commence with what is of most moment, you may rest assured that what, you said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest, attention. I am sorry that I have not got it by me to refer to (I, lent it to Charlie), but I think I have the contents in my head. It is, notorious, as you say, that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of, the orthodox, and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to, dogma. Such men are the real enemies of free thought. If anything could, persuade me to turn traitor to my reason, it would, for example, be, the blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic, journals.\\n\\nI travelled down part of the way with young Leslie Duncan, whom I think, you know. He was gracious enough to consider that a third-class carriage, and my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude. You, know that he came into his uncle's money a little time ago, and after a, first delirious outbreak, he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state, of despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for., How absurd are the ambitions of life when I think that I, who am fairly, happy and as keen as a razor edge, should be struggling for that which, I can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him! And yet, if I, can read my own nature, it is not the accumulation of money which is my, real aim, but only that I may acquire so much as will relieve my mind, of sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which I may have\\n\\nwith the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character. Always, a lady, whether she was bargaining with the butcher, or breaking in a, skittish charwoman, or stirring the porridge, which I can see her doing, with the porridge-stick in one hand, and the other holding her Revue, des deux Mondes within two inches of her dear nose. That was always her, favourite reading, and I can never think of her without the association, of its browny-yellow cover.\\n\\nYou must know, then, that within the boundaries of this city there are, two ladies, a mother and a daughter, whom I shall call Mrs. and Miss, Laura Andrews. They are patients of the governor's, and have become, to some extent friends of the family. Madame is Welsh, charming, in appearance, dignified in her manners, and High Church in her, convictions. The daughter is rather taller than the mother, but, otherwise they are strikingly alike. The mother is thirty-six and, the daughter eighteen. Both are exceedingly charming. Had I to choose, between them, I think, entre nous, that the mother would have attracted, me most, for I am thoroughly of Balzac's opinion as to the woman of, thirty. However, fate was to will it otherwise.\\n\\nAfter all, I own to you, that it might have been better had I listened, to what he had to say, and refused to give my own views. On the other, hand, truth MUST be as broad as the universe which it is to explain, and, therefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive., A protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards, truth. Who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the Almighty? It would be, an insolence on the part of a solar system, and yet it is done every, day by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers. There lies the real, impiety.\\n\\nI read over what I have written, but I can see that I give you no real, insight into the demoniac cleverness of Cullingworth. His views upon, medicine were most revolutionary, but I daresay that if things fulfil, their promise I may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel., With his brilliant and unusual gifts, his fine athletic record, his, strange way of dressing (his hat on the back of his head and his throat, bare), his thundering voice, and his ugly, powerful face, he had quite, the most marked individuality of any man that I have ever known.\\n\\nI was compelled, by the way, to forego an opening which a few months ago, would have been the very summit of my ambition. You must know (possibly, I told you), that immediately after I passed, I put my name down as a, candidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship, lines. It was done as a forlorn hope, for a man has usually to wait, several years before his turn comes round. Well, just a week after I, started here, I got a telegram one night from Liverpool: \\\"Join the Decia, to-morrow as surgeon, not later than eight in the evening.\\\" It was from, Staunton & Merivale, the famous South American firm, and the Decia is, a fine 6000-ton passenger boat, doing the round journey by Bahia and, Buenos Ayres to Rio and Valparaiso. I had a bad quarter of an hour, I, can tell you. I don't think I was ever so undecided about anything in my, life. Cullingworth was dead against my going, and his influence carried, the day.\\n\\ntickled the child, and gained over the whole household. He had these, attacks periodically, and made an arrangement with me by which I was to, deal with him, and we were to balance bills against each other. It was, a ghoulish compact, by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to, me, while a spell of health for Haywood sent me back to dry bread and, saveloys. However, it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling, which must otherwise have gone in food. At last, however, the poor, fellow died, and there was our final settlement.\\n\\na selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her, attacks, insisting upon my carrying them away then and there; so that I, stagger out of the house like one of Napoleon's generals coming out of, Italy. There is a good deal of method in the old lady, however, and on, her recovery she invariably sends round a porter, with a polite note to, say that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again.\\n\\nthinking that it was an accident, but an instant afterwards I received, another and a harder one. I dropped my paper with a growl, but the, moment that I glanced at him I saw how the matter stood. His foot was, jerking spasmodically, his two hands clenched, and drumming against his, breast, while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his, iris was to be seen. I sprang upon him, tore open his collar, unbuttoned, his waistcoat, and pulled his head down upon the seat. Crash went one of, his heels through the carriage window, but I contrived to sit upon his, knees while I kept hold of his two wrists.\\n\\nWell, I was averse from going myself, but Winnie was all for peace and, forgiveness. Women who claim nothing invariably get everything, and so, my gentle little wife always carries her point. Half an hour later I was, in Cadogan Terrace with very mixed feelings, but the kindlier ones at, the top. I tried to think that Cullingworth's treatment of me had been, pathological--the result of a diseased brain. If a delirious man had, struck me, I should not have been angry with him. That must be my way of, looking at it.\\n\\n\\\"You may label me as you like,\\\" I answered (and by this time I fear that, I had got my preaching stop fairly out); \\\"I don't pretend to know what, truth is, for it is infinite, and I finite; but I know particularly well, what it is NOT. It is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen, hundred years ago, and that we are for ever to refer back to what was, written and said in those days. No, sir; religion is a vital living, thing, still growing and working, capable of endless extension and, development, like all other fields of thought. There were many eternal, truths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book, some parts, of which may indeed be called holy. But there are others yet to be, revealed; and if we are to reject them because they are not in those, pages, we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice, of Kirschoff's spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in, Albertus Magnus. A modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write, to the magazines; but none the less he may be the little pipe which, conveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth. Look at this!\\\" I, cried, rising and reading my Carlyle text. \\\"That comes from no Hebrew, prophet, but from a ratepayer in Chelsea. He and Emerson are also among, the prophets. The Almighty has not said His last say to the human race\\n\\nAnd first of all, a thousand thanks for your two long letters, which lie, before me as I write. There is little enough personal news in them, but, I can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels, off very smoothly from week to week. On the other hand, you give me, plenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more, interesting. After all, we may very well agree to differ. You think, some things are proved which I don't believe in. You think some things, edifying which do not appear to me to be so. Well, I know that you are, perfectly honest in your belief. I am sure you give me credit for being, the same. The future wilt decide which of us is right. The survival of, the truest is a constant law, I fancy, though it must be acknowledged, that it is very slow in action.\\n\\n\\\"Too provincial, my boy! What's the good of a village practice with, a miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to, spread? My head was sticking out at one end of Bradfield and my feet at, the other. Why, there wasn't room for Hetty in the place, let alone, me! I've taken to the eye, my boy. There's a fortune in the eye. A man, grudges a half-crown to cure his chest or his throat, but he'd spend his, last dollar over his eye. There's money in ears, but the eye is a gold, mine.\\\"\\n\\nshoved them against the wall, and occasionally rushed out to the head, of the stair to address them en masse. At the same time, behind all, this tomfoolery, I, watching his prescriptions, could see a quickness of, diagnosis, a scientific insight, and a daring and unconventional use of, drugs, which satisfied me that he was right in saying that, under all, this charlatanism, there lay solid reasons for his success. Indeed\\n\\nIt was some weeks, however, before I gained his confidence, so far as, to be able to hold a real conversation with him. For a long time he was, very sullen and suspicious, resenting the constant watch which I kept, upon him. This could not be relaxed, for he was full of the most apish, tricks. One day he got hold of my tobacco pouch, and stuffed two ounces, of my tobacco into the long barrel of an Eastern gun which hangs on the, wall. He jammed it all down with the ramrod, and I was never able to get, it up again. Another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the, window, and would have sent the clock after it had I not prevented, him. Every day I took him for a two hours' constitutional, save when it, rained, and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down, the room. Heh! but it was a deadly, dreary, kind of life.\\n\\nThis took some thinking out. It had an ugly sound, but I gathered that, she meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since, these gentlemen were satisfied. So the bargain was struck, and I ordered, tea to be ready in an hour, while I went back to the station to fetch up, my luggage. A porter brought it up for eightpence (saving fourpence on, a cab, my boy!) and so I found myself in the heart of Birchespool with, a base of operations secured. I looked out of the little window of my, lodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs, with a spire or, two spurting up among them, and I shook my teaspoon defiantly at them., \\\"You've got to conquer me,\\\" said I, \\\"or else I'm man enough to conquer, you.\\\"\\n\\nSo, after much argument, it ended in the kind fellow going off and, leaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table. The money, burned my fingers, for I knew that his pension was not a very large one;, and yet, since I could not avoid taking it, there was no denying that it, was exceedingly useful. Out I sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it, upon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my, bed. Already, you see, I was getting to a state of enervating luxury, in my household arrangements, and I could only lull my conscience by, reminding myself that little Paul would have to sleep with me when he, came.\\n\\nor else may be taken as marking the tombs of Anglican chiefs, the, lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping. This had been explained, by the Patagonian school as being a universal system of, lightning-conductors. He (the lecturer) could not assent to this theory., In a series of observations, extending over several months, he had, discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing, if followed, out, invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were, connected with furnaces. No one who knew how addicted the ancient, Britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant., Evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central, chamber, and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the, tubes to the house of every citizen, so that he might inhale it at will., Having illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams, the lecturer, concluded by saying that, although true science was invariably cautious, and undogmatic, it was none the less an incontestable fact that so, much light had been thrown upon old London, that every action of the, citizens' daily life was known, from the taking of a tub in the morning\\n\\nnow that I come to think of it, I have never enjoyed very much of your, confidence in return. But that may be my fault. Perhaps you don't find, me sympathetic, even though I have every wish to be. I can only say that, I find you intensely so, and perhaps I presume too much upon the fact., But no, every instinct in my nature tells me that I don't bore you by my, confidences.\\n\\nAnd all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news. It is, that I had a telegram from Cullingworth this morning--after nine months', silence. It was dated from Avonmouth, the town where I had suspected, that he had settled, and it said simply, \\\"Come at once. I have urgent, need of you. CULLINGWORTH.\\\" Of course, I shall go by the first train, to-morrow. It may mean anything or nothing. In my heart of hearts I hope, and believe that old Cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his, partner or in some other way. I always believed that he would turn up, trumps, and make my fortune as well as his own. He knows that if I am, not very quick or brilliant I am fairly steady and reliable. So that's, what I've been working up to all along, Bertie, that to-morrow I go to, join Cullingworth, and that it looks as if there was to be an opening, for me at last. I gave you a sketch of him and his ways, so that you may, take an interest in the development of my fortune, which you could not, do if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand, to me.\\n\\n, Do you think that such a thing as chance exists? Rather an explosive, sentence to start a letter with; but pray cast your mind back over your, own life, and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of, chance. You know how often the turning down this street or that, the, accepting or rejecting of an invitation, may deflect the whole current, of our lives into some other channel. Are we mere leaves, fluttered, hither and thither by the wind, or are we rather, with every conviction, that we are free agents, carried steadily along to a definite and, pre-determined end? I confess that as I advance through life, I become, more and more confirmed in that fatalism to which I have always had an, inclination.\\n\\nWell, I made the most dreadful fool of myself. At first, the good lady, who (as I think I told you) is very dignified and rather reserved, could, not believe her senses. Then, as the full force of my enormity came upon, her she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest, woman I had ever seen. It was an interview with a refrigerator. She, asked me what I had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged, me to subject her to such an outrage. I saw, of course, that any excuses, upon my part would put her on the right track and give poor Laura away;, so I stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand, presenting\\n\\nand two layers of them squatting in the cellar? Well, that's my house of, business on an average day. The folk come in from the county fifty miles, off, and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep, so as to be first in, when the housekeeper comes down. The medical officer of health made an, official complaint of the over-crowding of my waiting-rooms. They wait, in the stables, and sit along the racks and under the horses' bellies., I'll turn some of 'em on to you, my boy, and then you'll know a little, more about it.\\\"\\n\\nI walked down to the Park, which is the chief centre of the place, and I, found that I liked everything I saw of it. It was a lovely evening, and, the air was fresh and sweet. I sat down and listened to the band for an, hour, watching all the family parties, and feeling particularly lonely., Music nearly always puts me into the minor key; so there came a time, when I could stand it no longer, and I set off to find my way back to my, lodgings. On the whole, I felt that Birchespool was a place in which a, man might very well spend a happy life.\\n\\n\\\"The best dispenser in the world!\\\" cried Cullingworth, patting her on, the shoulder. \\\"You see how I do it, Munro. I write on a label what the, prescription is, and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged., The man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon, hole. Hetty makes it up, passes out the bottle, and takes the money., Now, come on and clear some of these folk out of the house.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Williams and I stood for five minutes without a word, hushed by the, presence of that supreme fact. Then we laid him straight, and drew the, sheet over him. She knelt down and prayed and sobbed, while I sat on, the bed, with the cold hand in mine. Then my heart turned to lead as I, remembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the, moral principles of right and wrong. But when you look closely it is a, question whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not, prove to have been a right to the interests of posterity. That sounds, a little foggy; but I will make my meaning more clear when I say that, I think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those, great hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe, that both, are making for improvement; but that the action of the one is immediate\\n\\nso they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks. They have the, most singular notions about medicines. \\\"It's that strong that a spoon, will stand oop in't!\\\" is one man's description. Above all, they love to, have two bottles, one with a solution of citric acid, and the other with, carbonate of soda. When the mixture begins to fizz, they realise that, there is indeed a science of medicine.\\n\\n\\\"Deuced interesting thing, Munro,\\\" said he. \\\"Come and look at this, temperature chart. I've been taking it every quarter of an hour since I, couldn't sleep, and it's up and down till it looks like the mountains in, the geography books. We'll have some drugs in--eh, what, Munro?--and by, Crums, we'll revolutionise all their ideas about fevers. I'll write a, pamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean, out of date, and they'll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And there is one more thing, Mr. Detective, sir,\\\" said Whitehall, explosively. \\\"I'm not a rich man, sir, only the ---- half-pay skipper, of an armed transport; but by ----, sir, I'd give you this hat full of, dollars to know the name of the ---- rascal who wrote that anonymous, letter, sir. By ---- sir, you'd have a real case to look after then.\\\", And he waved his black thorn ferociously.\\n\\nWell, I sat down there and brooded. In my heart I did not believe that, Cullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease. That could not, have been his real reason for driving me from the practice. He had found, me in the way in his domestic life, no doubt, and he had devised, this excuse for getting rid of me. Whatever the reason was, it was, sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice\\n\\ninto forced smiles when I had asked him point blank what was the matter?, One obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without, telling also how he had acquired his information. But I knew enough of, Cullingworth's resource to feel that he could easily have got over such, a difficulty as that. In fact, in this last letter he HAD got over it, by his tale about the grate and the maid. He must have had some stronger, reason for restraint. As I thought over the course of our relations I, was convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until I had, committed myself, and then to abandon me, so that I should myself have, no resource but to compound with my creditors-to be, in fact, that which, my mother had called him.\\n\\nWisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme, of Nature. What proof do we want, then, from a book? If the man who, observes the myriad stars, and considers that they and their innumerable, satellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens, each, swinging clear of the other's orbit--if, I say, the man who sees this, cannot realise the Creator's attributes without the help of the book of, Job, then his view of things is beyond my understanding. Nor is it only, in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some, intelligent force. Nothing is too tiny for that fostering care. We see, the minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the, calyx of the flower, the most microscopic hair and gland each with its, definite purposeful function to perform. What matter whether these came, by special creation or by evolution? We know as a matter of fact that, they came by evolution, but that only defines the law. It does not, explain it.\\n\\nWell, we all work back again by two o'clock, when we find dinner waiting, for us. We may or may not have finished our rounds. If not away we go, again. If we have, Horton dictates his prescriptions, and strides off, to bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth. He is the most abandoned, smoker I have ever met with, collecting the dottles of his pipes in, the evening, and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the, stable yard. When he has departed for his nap, McCarthy and I get to, work on the medicine. There are, perhaps, fifty bottles to put up, with, pills, ointment, etc. It is quite half-past four before we have them all, laid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids. Then we have, an hour or so of quiet, when we smoke or read, or box with the coachman, in the harness room. After tea the evening's work commences. From six to, nine people are coming in for their medicine, or fresh patients wishing, advice. When these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases, which may be on the list; and so, about ten o'clock, we may hope to have, another smoke, and perhaps a game of cards. Then it is a rare thing for, a night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a, case which may take us two hours, or may take us ten. Hard work, as you, see; but Horton is such a good chap, and works so hard himself, that one, does not mind what one does. And then we are all like brothers in the, house; our talk is just a rattle of chaff, and the patients are as, homely as ourselves, so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of, us.\\n\\nBut we were demoralised by luxury. We could no longer manage without a, helper--especially now in the winter time, when fires had to be lit--the, most heart-breaking task that a man can undertake. I bethought me of, the quiet Miss Williams, and hunted her up in her shop. She was quite, willing to come, and saw how she could get out of the rent; but the, difficulty lay with her stock. This sounded formidable at first, but, when I came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings, it, did not appear insurmountable. In half an hour my watch was pawned, and, the affair concluded. I returned with an excellent housekeeper, and, with a larger basketful of inferior Swedish matches, bootlaces, cakes of, black lead, and little figures made of sugar than I should have thought, it possible to get for the money. So now we have settled down, and I, hope that a period of comparative peace lies before us.\\n\\nI nearly snatched it out of his hands. Then away I ran to take, possession of my property. Never shall I forget my feelings, my dear, Bertie, when the key clicked in the lock, and the door flew open. It was, my own house--all my very own! I shut the door again, the noise of the, street died down, and I had, in that empty, dust-strewn hall, such a, sense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before. In all my life, it was the first time that I had ever stood upon boards which were not, paid for by another.\\n\\nAnd then as I walked back I considered how far I could avail myself of, this money from Cullingworth. It was not much, but it would be madness, to start without it, for I had sent home the little which I had saved at, Horton's. I had not more than six pounds in the whole world. I reflected, that the money could make no difference to Cullingworth, with his large, income, while it made a vast one to me. I should repay him in a year, or two at the latest. Perhaps I might get on so well as to be able to, dispense with it almost at once. There could be no doubt that it was the, representations of Cullingworth as to my future prospects in Bradfield, which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the Decia. I need, not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance, from his hands. On my return, I told him that I had decided to do so\\n\\nWhen the auction was over, I paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on, to a trolly, the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings., I found that I had over-estimated the cost of furnishing, for the total, expense was little more than three pounds. We walked round to Oakley, Villa, and I proudly deposited all my goods in the hall. And here came, another extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes. The, porter when I had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a, huge mat of oakum, as ugly a thing as I have ever set eyes upon. This he, laid down inside my door, and then without a word, brushing aside every, remonstrance or attempt at thanks, he vanished away with his trolly into, the night.\\n\\nfor a short spell I could manage to live on a couple of pence a day; but, what I am doing now is not to be a mere spurt, but my regular mode of, life for many a month to come. My tea and sugar and milk (Swiss), come collectively to one penny a day. The loaf is at twopence, three-farthings, and I consume one a day. My dinner consists in, rotation of one third of a pound of bacon, cooked over the gas (twopence, halfpenny), or two saveloys (twopence), or two pieces of fried, fish (twopence), or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of Chicago beef, (twopence). Any one of these, with a due allowance of bread and water\\n\\nBut once inside, there was so much to be done that I did not know what, I should turn to first. I bought a one-and-ninepenny broom and set to, work. You notice that I am precise about small sums, because just there, lies the whole key of the situation. In the yard I found a zinc pail, with a hole in it, which was most useful, for by its aid I managed to, carry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped. Then with my new, broom, my coat hung on a gas-bracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the, elbow, I cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall, brushing the refuse, into the yard. After that I did as much for the upper floor, with the, result that I brought several square yards of dust down into the hall, again, and undid my previous cleaning. This was disheartening, but at, least it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future. When I had, finished, I was as hot and dirty as if it were half-time at a football, match. I thought of our tidy charwoman at home, and realised what, splendid training she must be in.\\n\\nHis mind runs rather on naval architecture at present, and he has been, devising an ingenious method of preventing wooden-sided vessels from, being crippled by artillery fire. I did not think much of his magnetic, attractor, because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success, that he claimed for it, it would merely have the effect of substituting, some other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells. This new, project has, however, more to recommend it. This is the idea, as put in, his own words; and, as he has been speaking of little else for the last, two days, I ought to remember them.\\n\\nwhen we think of the more advanced type of young man, we picture him as, bald, and with double eye-glasses. I am an absolute animal myself, and, my only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going. On the, other hand, there is some evidence in favour of the development of a, sixth sense-that of perception. If I had it now I should know that you, are heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism.\\n\\nI confess that I have never been able to understand the position of the, atheist. In fact, I have come to disbelieve in his existence, and, to look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach. It may, represent a temporary condition, a passing mental phase, a defiant, reaction against an anthropomorphic ideal; but I cannot conceive that, any man can continue to survey Nature and to deny that there are laws at, work which display intelligence and power. The very existence of a world, carries with it the proof of a world-maker, as the table guarantees, the pre-existence of the carpenter. Granting this, one may form what, conception one will of that Maker, but one cannot be an atheist.\\n\\nwhich should keep parallel with his medical one, were for ever at an, end. On the whole, bearing in mind my mother's opposition, and the, continual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks, I was, not very sorry. On the contrary, a sudden curious little thrill of, happiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff, and, as a, drift of rooks passed cawing over my head, I began cawing also in the, overflow of my spirits.\\n\\nThe unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased, to deserve the name. You remember that in my last I had received my, dismissal, and was on the eve of starting for the little country town, of Stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there., Well, in the morning, before I came down to breakfast, I was putting one, or two things into a bag, when there came a timid knock at my door, and, there was Mrs. Cullingworth in her dressing-jacket, with her hair down, her back.\\n\\n\\\"You'll forgive me for saying, Dr. Munro, sir, that you are a ---- lucky, fellow,\\\" said he. \\\"You've put your hand in the bag, sir, and taken out, the eel first time, as any one with half an eye can see. Now, I've had, three dips, and landed a snake every dip. If I'd had a good woman at my, side, Dr. Munro, sir, I might not be the broken half-pay skipper of an, armed transport to-day.\\\"\\n\\nFred was a little better during the day, and even seemed in a dull, sort of way to recognise his sister, who brought him flowers in the, afternoon. Towards evening his temperature sank to 101.5@, and he, fell into a kind of stupor. As it happened, Dr. Porter came in about, supper-time, and I asked him if he would step up and have a look at my, patient. He did so, and we found him dozing peacefully. You would hardly, think that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous, in my life. It was the merest chance in the world that Porter went up at, all.\\n\\nthe coachman, Mrs. Cullingworth, and the coachman's wife. We dug, foundations, got bricks in by the cartload, made our own mortar, and I, think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it. It's not quite, as flat-chested as we could wish; and I think that if I were a horse, inside it, I should be careful about brushing against the walls;, but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished., Cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves; but as, we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing, need.\\n\\nOf course, I told him that his views were diabolical; but, especially, since that warning which I had from his wife, I discount everything, that he says. He begins in earnest; but as he goes on the humour of, exaggeration gets hold of him, and he winds up with things which he, would never uphold in cold blood. However, the fact remains that we, differ widely in our views of professional life, and I fear that we may, come to grief over the question.\\n\\nWell, there the matter might have ended; but about three days afterwards, who should be shown into my consulting room but Mrs. La Force and her, daughter. I thought the latter looked twice at me, when her mother, introduced her, as if she had some recollection of my face; but she, evidently could not recall where she had seen it, and I said nothing to, help her. They both seemed to be much distressed in mind--indeed\\n\\nInstead of \\\"pulling himself together,\\\" he very nearly knocked me, asunder. I was all abroad for an instant. He had turned on me like a, flash, and had struck me on the throat just under the chin, my head, being a little back at the moment. It made me swallow once or twice, I, can tell you. Sudden as the blow was, I had countered, in the automatic, sort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does. It was only, from the elbow, with no body behind it, but it served to stave him off, for the moment, while I was making inquiries about my windpipe. Then, in he came with a rush; and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of, delight, we were pushed, almost locked in each other's arms on to that, big pedestal of which I have spoken. \\\"Go it, little 'un!\\\" \\\"Give him, beans!\\\" yelled the mob, who had lost all sight of the origin of the, fray, and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter, man. So there, my dear Bertie, was I, within a few hours of my entrance, into this town, with my top-hat down to my ears, my highly professional, frock-coat, and my kid gloves, fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal, in one of the most public places, in the heart of a yelling and hostile, mob! I ask you whether that was cruel luck or not?\\n\\nas far as I have ever been able to observe it, has been that it allows, the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other, men could only reach by hard work. In this sense Cullingworth was the, greatest genius that I have ever known. He never seemed to work, and yet, he took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the ten-hour-a-day, men. That might not count for much, for he was quite capable of idling, ostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night; but, start a subject of your own for him, and then see his originality and, strength. Talk about torpedoes, and he would catch up a pencil, and on, the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some, novel contrivance for piercing a ship's netting and getting at her side\\n\\nI remember how struck I was when first I saw the actual cautery applied, in a case of spinal disease. The white hot iron was pressed firmly into, the patient's back, without the use of any anaesthetic, and what with, the sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh I felt faint and ill., Yet, to my astonishment, the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle, of his face, and on my inquiring afterwards, he assured me that the, proceeding was absolutely painless, a remark which was corroborated, by the surgeon. \\\"The nerves are so completely and instantaneously, destroyed,\\\" he explained, \\\"that they have no time to convey a painful, impression.\\\" But then if this be so, what becomes of all the martyrs, at the stake, and the victims of Red Indians, and other poor folk, over whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered? It may be that, Providence is not only not cruel itself, but will not allow man to be, cruel either. Do your worst, and it will step in with a \\\"No, I won't, allow this poor child of mine to be hurt\\\"; and then comes the dulling, of the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of, the tormentor. David Livingstone under the claws of the lion must have, looked like an object lesson of the evil side of things, and yet he has, left it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than, otherwise. I am well convinced that if the newly-born infant and the man, who had just died could compare their experiences, the former would have, proved to be the sufferer. It is not for nothing that the first thing, the newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and, protest energetically against fate.\\n\\nPerhaps it was too bad of me to say that. I might have guarded without, countering. Anyhow; it had the effect of ending an interview which was, becoming oppressive. My visitor was too indignant to answer, and swept, out of the room without a word. From my window I could see him hurry, down the street, a little black angry thing, very hot and troubled, because he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and, compasses.\\n\\nI face my study window as I write, Bertie. Slate-coloured clouds with, ragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead. Between them one has a, glimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray. I can hear the gentle swish, of the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller, among the leaves. Sometimes it falls straight and heavy, till the air is, full of the delicate gray shading, and for half a foot above the ground, there is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules. Then, without any change in the clouds it cases off again. Pools line my walk\\n\\nso I climbed out of bed, gathered a little heap of tobacco-dust from the, linings of my pocket, and smoked the whole thing over. That life-belt of, which I had spoken so confidingly had burst, and left me to kick as best, I might in very deep water. I read the note over and over again; and for, all my dilemma, I could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and, stupidity of the thing. The picture of the host and hostess busying, themselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest, struck me as one of the funniest things I could remember. And there, was the stupidity of it, because surely a child could have seen that my, mother's attack was in answer to my defence. Why should we write a duet, each saying the same thing? Well, I'm still very confused about it all\\n\\nand I knew that her mother's will was her law, and that her course, was already marked out for her. However, we exchanged our little, confidences, and met occasionally by appointment, and tried to make our, lives brighter without darkening those of any one else. I can see you, shake your head here and growl, like the comfortable married man that, you are, that such relations are very dangerous. So they are, my boy:, but neither of us cared, she out of innocence and I out of recklessness\\n\\n\\\"Your letter to hand. Why not call me a liar at once? I tell you that I, have seen thirty thousand patients in the last year. My actual takings, have been over four thousand pounds. All patients come to me. Would not, cross the street to see Queen Victoria. You can have all visiting, all, surgery, all midwifery. Make what you like of it. Will guarantee three, hundred pounds the first year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may knock,\\\" said he, when I began to percuss his chest, \\\"but I am, ---- sure there's no one at home. They've all gone visiting one another., Sir John Hutton had a try some years ago. 'Why, dammy, man, where's your, liver?' said he. 'Seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a, porridge stick,' said he. 'Nothing is in its right place.' 'Except, my heart, Sir John,' said I. 'Aye, by ----, that will never lose its, moorings while it has a flap left.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I have written to you about my practice, and I've wired to you, about it, and here you sit asking me if I work it in two rooms. I'll, have to hire the market square before I've finished, and then I won't, have space to wag my elbows. Can your imagination rise to a great house, with people waiting in every room, jammed in as tight as they'll fit\\n\\nWell, it ended by lord and lacquey moving off, and leaving me with my, patient. I thought that I should lose no time in establishing a kindly, relation with him, so I drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask, him a few questions about his health and habits. Not a word could I get, out of him in reply. He sat as sullen as a mule, with a kind of sneer, about his handsome face, which showed me very well that he had heard, everything. I tried this and tried that, but not a syllable could I, get from him; so at last I turned from him and began to look over some, illustrated papers on the table. He doesn't read, it seems, and will do, nothing but look at pictures. Well, I was sitting like this with my back, half turned, when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking, gently at me, and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into, my coat pocket. I caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round, but too, late to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind, the Hon. James Derwent, who sat grinning at me like a mischievous, monkey.\\n\\nif we do not ourselves degrade it, will set an edge to all that is good, in us. I did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a man's whole, life and every action with unselfishness. I did not know how easy it is, to be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be, so; or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes, instead of two. I had much to learn, you see; but I think I have learned, it.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Munro\\\" (this was the style of the thing), \\\"why was armour, abandoned, eh? What! I'll tell you why. It was because the weight of, metal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he, could carry. But battles are not fought now-a-days by men who are, standing up. Your infantry are all lying on their stomachs, and it would, take very little to protect them. And steel has improved, Munro! Chilled, steel! Bessemer! Bessemer! Very good. How much to cover a man? Fourteen, inches by twelve, meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance., A notch at one side for the rifle. There you have it, laddie--the, Cullingworth patent portable bullet-proof shield! Weight? Oh, the weight, would be sixteen pounds. I worked it out. Each company carries its, shields in go-carts, and they are served out on going into action. Give, me twenty thousand good shots, and I'll go in at Calais and come out at, Pekin. Think of it, my boy! the moral effect. One side gets home every, time and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates. No, troops would stand it. The nation that gets it first will pitchfork the, rest of Europe over the edge. They're bound to have it--all of them., Let's reckon it out. There's about eight million of them on a war, footing. Let us suppose that only half of them have it. I say only half\\n\\nWe are at one, he and I, in thinking that the infinite is beyond our, perception. We differ only in that he sees evil and I see good in the, working of the universe. Ah, what a mystery it all is! Let us be honest, and humble and think kindly of each other. There's a line of stars all, winking at me over the opposite roof--winking slyly at the silly little, person with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never, understand.\\n\\nWe came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd, waiting for our chance. Presently up went a very neat little table. I, gave a nod and got it for nine shillings. Then three rather striking, looking chairs, black wood and cane bottoms. Four shillings each I gave, for those. Then a metal umbrella-stand, four and sixpence. That was a, mere luxury, but I was warming to the work. A job lot of curtains all, tied together in a bundle went up. Somebody bid five shillings. The, auctioneer's eye came round to me, and I nodded. Mine again for five, and sixpence. Then I bought a square of red drugget for half-a-crown\\n\\nThen I pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which I had, from the first determined upon as my bedchamber. I found an old packing, case in the yard--a relic of my predecessor's removal--and this made a, very good wash-hand stand for my basin and jug. When it was all fixed up, I walked, swelling with pride, through my own chambers, giving a touch, here and a touch there until I had it perfect. I wish my mother could, see it--or, on second thoughts, I don't; for I know that her first act, would be to prepare gallons of hot water, and to holystone the whole, place down, from garret to cellar--and I know by my own small experience, what that means.\\n\\nThere, now, you see what comes of waving the red rag! Let me make, a concession to appease you. I do believe that Christianity in its, different forms has been the very best thing for the world during all, this long barbarous epoch. Of course, it has been the best thing, else, Providence would not have permitted it. The engineer knows best what, tools to use in strengthening his own machine. But when you say that, this is the best and last tool which will be used, you are laying down, the law a little too much.\\n\\nthough open to attacks of romance. I can recollect her coming to see me, at a junction through which my train passed, with a six months' absence, on either side of the incident. We had five minutes' conversation, my, head out of the carriage window. \\\"Wear flannel next your skin, my dear, boy, and never believe in eternal punishment,\\\" was her last item of, advice as we rolled out of the station. Then to finish her portrait, I need not tell you, who have seen her, that she is young-looking and, comely to be the mother of about thirty-five feet of humanity. She, was in the railway carriage and I on the platform the other day. \\\"Your, husband had better get in or we'll go without him,\\\" said the guard. As, we went off, the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket, and I know, that she was looking for a shilling.\\n\\nI may be doing you an injustice, Bertie, but it seemed to me in, your last that there were indications that the free expression of my, religious views had been distasteful to you. That you should disagree, with me I am prepared for; but that you should object to free and honest, discussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest, over, would, I confess, be a disappointment. The Freethinker is placed, at this disadvantage in ordinary society, that whereas it would be, considered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox, opinion, no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees., There was a time when it took a brave man to be a Christian. Now it, takes a brave man not to be. But if we are to wear a gag, and hide our, thoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimate----no, but I, won't believe it. You and I have put up too many thoughts together and, chased them where-ever{sic} they would double, Bertie; so just write to, me like a good fellow, and tell me that I am an ass. Until I have that, comforting assurance, I shall place a quarantine upon everything which, could conceivably be offensive to you.\\n\\nAnd so the matter blew over; but I very much fear, Bertie, that this is, the first row of a series. I have a presentiment that sooner or later my, position here will become untenable. Still, I shall give it a fair trial, as long as he will let me. Cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have, nothing but inferiors and dependants round him. Now, I like to stand on, my own legs, and think with my own mind. If he'll let me do this we'll, get along very well; but if I know the man he will claim submission\\n\\nwhite-haired, old Roman Catholic priest, who had sat quietly reading his, office in the corner. We fell into the most intimate talk, which lasted, all the way to Avonmouth--indeed, so interested was I that I very nearly, passed through the place without knowing it. Father Logan (for that was, his name) seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should, be--self-sacrificing and pure-minded, with a kind of simple cunning, about him, and a deal of innocent fun. He had the defects as well as the, virtues of his class, for he was absolutely reactionary in his views., We discussed religion with fervour, and his theology was somewhere, about the Early Pliocene. He might have chattered the matter over with, a priest of Charlemagne's Court, and they would have shaken hands after, every sentence. He would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit., It was consistency in his eyes. If our astronomers and inventors and, law-givers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation, be? Is religion the only domain of thought which is non-progressive, and, to be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago?, Can they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider, outlook? A half-formed brain makes a half-formed God, and who shall say, that our brains are even half-formed yet? The truly inspired priest is, the man or woman with the big brain. It is not the shaven patch on the, outside, but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of, election.\\n\\nMind, my dear Bertie, I do not wish to run down your view or that of any, other man. We who claim toleration should be the first to extend it, to others. I am only indicating my own position, as I have often done, before. And I know your reply so well. Can't I hear your grave voice, saying \\\"Have faith!\\\" Your conscience allows you to. Well, mine won't, allow me. I see so clearly that faith is not a virtue, but a vice. It is, a goat which has been herded with the sheep. If a man deliberately shut, his physical eyes and refused to use them, you would be as quick as any, one in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to Nature. And yet you, would counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift, the reason, and, to refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life.\\n\\nCullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as, I had advised, and that he would let me know the result in a few days., Mrs. C. would hardly shake hands with me when I said goodbye; but I like, her the better for that. He must have a great deal of good in him, or he, could not have won her love and confidence so completely. Perhaps there, is another Cullingworth behind the scenes--a softer, tenderer man, who, can love and invite love. If there is, I have never got near him. And, yet I may only have been tapping at the shell. Who knows? For that, matter, it is likely enough that he has never got at the real Johnnie, Munro. But you have, Bertie; and I think that you've had a little too, much of him this time, only you encourage me to this sort of excess by, your sympathetic replies. Well, I've done as much as the General Post, Office will carry for fivepence, so I'll conclude by merely remarking, that a fortnight has passed, and that I have had no news from Avonmouth\\n\\nI often have my doubts, Bertie, if there is such a thing as the, existence of evil? If we could honestly convince ourselves that there, was not, it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion., But don't let us strain truth even for such an object as that. I must, confess that there are some forms of vice, cruelty for example, for, which it is hard to find any explanation, save indeed that it is a, degenerate survival of that war-like ferocity which may once have been, of service in helping to protect the community. No; let me be frank, and, say that I can't make cruelty fit into my scheme. But when you find that, other evils, which seem at first sight black enough, really tend in, the long run to the good of mankind, it may be hoped that those which, continue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some, fashion which is now inexplicable.\\n\\nI left my baggage at the office, and jumped into a tramcar which was, passing the station, with the intention of looking for lodgings, as, I judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel. The conductor, interested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think, that the poorer classes in England are one of the kindliest races on, earth. Policemen, postmen, railway guards, busmen, what good helpful, fellows they all are! This one reckoned the whole thing out, how this, street was central but dear, and the other was out-of-the-way but cheap\\n\\n\\\"I am quite convinced that what you say is true,\\\" he answered; \\\"but Lady, Saltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas, into him. You know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason, with a lady. However, I have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if, you would see Lady Saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood, your views upon this point, and that you are personally a supporter of a, Hereditary Chamber.\\\"\\n\\nWith all respect to you, Bertie, it is very easy to be orthodox. A man, who wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would, certainly choose to be so. As Smiles says--\\\"A dead fish can float with, the stream, but it takes a man to swim against it.\\\" What could be more, noble than the start and the starter of Christianity? How beautiful, the upward struggle of an idea, like some sweet flower blossoming out, amongst rubble and cinders! But, alas! to say that this idea was a final, idea! That this scheme of thought was above the reason! That this, gentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even, imagine a personality without irreverence!--all this will come to rank, with the strangest delusions of mankind. And then how clouded has become, that fine daybreak of Christianity! Its representatives have risen from, the manger to the palace, from the fishing smack to the House of Lords., Nor is that other old potentate in the Vatican, with his art treasures\\n\\nAfter all, true science must be synonymous with religion, since science, is the acquirement of fact; and facts are all that we have from which to, deduce what we are and why we are here. But surely the more we pry into, the methods by which results are brougt{sic} about, the more stupendous, and wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind, the, power which drifts the solar system in safety through space, and, yet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the, honey-bearing flower. What is that central intelligence? You may fit, up your dogmatic scientist with a 300-diameter microscope, and with a, telescope with a six-foot speculum, but neither near nor far can he get, a trace of that great driving power.\\n\\n\\\"they are in a sense relations of yours. You are very closely allied to, the Percies, and the Saltires have Percy blood in them also. They are, only a cadet branch, and you are close upon the main line; but still it, is not for us to deny the connection.\\\" She brought a cold sweat out upon, me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to Lord, Saltire and explaining our respective positions. Several times during, the evening I heard her murmur complacently that they were only the, cadet branch.\\n\\nCullingworth and his wife. They visit nobody, and nobody visits them. My, living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my, head, although I have never done anything unprofessional myself. Who, should I see in the street the other day but the McFarlanes, whom you, will remember at Linlithgow? I was foolish enough to propose to Maimie, McFarlane once, and she was sensible enough to refuse me. What I should, have done had she accepted me, I can't imagine; for that was three years, ago, and I have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then., Well, there's no use yearning for what you can't have, and there's no, other man living to whom I would speak about the matter at all; but life, is a deadly, lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself., Why is it that I am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you\\n\\nI was, as you may imagine, all in a tingle to know what it was that he, wanted with me. However, as he made no allusion to it, I did not care to, ask, and, during our longish walk, we talked about indifferent matters., It was football first, I remember, whether Richmond had a chance against, Blackheath, and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the, old scrimmages. Then he got on to inventions, and became so excited that, he had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all, his points home with his fist upon his palm. I can see him now stopping\\n\\nbut a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth. One, feels that the white upon the hair, like that upon the mountain, should, signify a height attained. I rose and bade him good-night, with a last, impression of him leaning back in his dressing-gown, a sodden cigar-end, in the corner of his mouth, his beard all slopped with whisky, and his, half-glazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr. I, had to go into the street and walk up and down for half-an-hour before I, felt clean enough to go to bed.\\n\\nAt three in the morning, I was awakened by a dreadful crash. Bounding, out of bed I rushed into the other room. Poor Fred was standing in his, long gown, a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning, day. He had pulled over his washing-stand (with what object only his, bemuddled mind could say), and the whole place was a morass of water, with islands of broken crockery. I picked him up and put him back into, his bed again--his body glowing through his night-dress, and his eyes, staring wildly about him. It was evidently impossible to leave him, and, so I spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair., No, it was certainly not a sinecure that I had undertaken.\\n\\nand saying that, poor as our family was, none of them had ever fallen so, low as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous, character and doubtful antecedents. I answered that Cullingworth spoke, sometimes of paying his creditors, that Mrs. Cullingworth was in favour, of it also, and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that I, should sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which I had, no connection. I assured her that if Cullingworth did anything from then, onwards which seemed to me dishonourable, I would disassociate myself, from him, and I mentioned that I had already refused to adopt some of, his professional methods. Well, in reply to this, my mother wrote a, pretty violent letter about what she thought of Cullingworth, which led, to another from me defending him, and showing that there were some deep, and noble traits in his character. That produced another still more, outspoken letter from her; and so the correspondence went on, she, attacking and I defending, until a serious breach seemed to be opening, between us. I refrained from writing at last, not out of ill temper, but, because I thought that if she were given time she would cool down, and, take, perhaps, a more reasonable view of the situation. My father, from, the short note which he sent me, seemed to think the whole business, absolutely irregular, and to refuse to believe my accounts of, Cullingworth's practice and receipts. This double opposition, from the, very people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the, whole affair, caused me to be less disappointed than I should otherwise, have been when it all came to an end. In fact, I was quite in the humour, to finish it myself when Fate did it for me.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said I, \\\"that that is rather further than I am prepared, to go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain, friction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well, that I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall, be happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take, over my duties.\\\"\\n\\nYou make a mistake, however, in assuming that those who think as I, do are such a miserable minority. The whole essence of our thought is, independence and individual judgment; so that we don't get welded into, single bodies as the churches do, and have no opportunity of testing our, own strength. There are, no doubt, all shades of opinion among us; but, if you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the, doctrines usually accepted, and think that sectarian churches tend, to evil rather than good, I fancy that the figures would be rather, surprising. When I read your letter, I made a list of all those men with, whom I ever had intimate talk upon such matters. I got seventeen names\\n\\nthey have the merit of being consoling; for if we could conscientiously, see that sin served a purpose, and a good one, it would take some of the, blackness out of life. It seems to me, then, that Nature, still working, on the lines of evolution, strengthens the race in two ways. The one is, by improving those who are morally strong, which is done by increased, knowledge and broadening religious views; the other, and hardly less, important, is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally, weak. This is accomplished by drink and immorality. These are really two, of the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of, the race. I picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the, garden of life and plucking up the weeds. Looked at in one's own day\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" he explained, \\\"there's no good my putting a forty pound suite, into a bed-room, and then having to chuck it all out of the window in, order to make room for a hundred-pound one. No sense in that, Munro!, Eh, what! I'm going to furnish this house as no house has ever been, furnished. By Crums! I'll bring the folk from a hundred miles round just, to have leave to look at it. But I must do it room by room. Come down, with me and look at the dining-room. You must be hungry after your, journey.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then I have seen something of the same sort in Cullingworth; but, he is so strange a being that I never attach much importance to his, variations. He glares at me like an angry bull occasionally; and then, when I ask him what is the matter, he growls out, \\\"Oh, nothing!\\\" and, turns on his heel. Then at other times he is so cordial and friendly, that he almost overdoes it, and I find myself wondering whether he is, not acting. It must seem ungracious to you that I should speak so of a, man who has been my benefactor; and it seems so to me also, but still, that IS the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes. It's an, absurd idea, too; for what possible object could his wife and he have, in pretending to be amiable, if they did not really feel so? And yet you, know the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not, with his eyes.\\n\\nnever returned. I fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited, their confidence. Others have become warm partisans. But they have, nearly all been very poor people; and when you consider how many one and, sixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which, I must find every quarter for rent, taxes, gas and water, you will, understand that even with some success, I have still found it a hard, matter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder., However, my boy, two quarters are paid up, and I enter upon a third one, with my courage unabated. I have lost about a stone, but not my heart.\\n\\nfrom boot-blacking to medicine-carrying. His one dissipation is cutting, out of paper, or buying in lead (on the rare occasion when we find a, surplus), an army of little soldiers. I have brought a patient into the, consulting room, and found a torrent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, pouring across the table. I have been myself attacked as I sat silently, writing, and have looked up to find fringes of sharp-shooters pushing, up towards me, columns of infantry in reserve, a troop of cavalry on my, flank, while a battery of pea muzzle-loaders on the ridge of my medical, dictionary has raked my whole position--with the round, smiling face of, the general behind it all. I don't know how many regiments he has on a, peace footing; but if serious trouble were to break out, I am convinced, that every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms.\\n\\nIn that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty, night. He was gaily dressed in the first place, check trousers, white, waistcoat, a flower in his button hole. But the look of the man was, very much to my heart. He was ruddy checked and black eyed, with a jolly, stout figure and an honest genial smile. I felt as we clinched hands in, the foggy grimy station that I had met a man and a friend.\\n\\nWell, then, it was night when we reached Avonmouth, and as I popped my, head out of the carriage window, the first thing that my eyes rested, upon was old Cullingworth, standing in, the circle of light under a, gas-lamp. His frock coat was flying open, his waistcoat unbuttoned at, the top, and his hat (a top hat this time) jammed on the back of his, head, with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it. In every way\\n\\nshortly after my start, telling me that he had heard of my proceedings, from my mother, and that he hoped to learn of my success. He is, as I, think you know, an ardent Wesleyan, like all my father's people, and he, told me that the chief Wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend, of his own, that he had learned from him that there was no Wesleyan, doctor, and that, being of a Wesleyan stock myself, if I would present, the enclosed letter of introduction to the minister, I should certainly, find it very much to my advantage. I thought it over, Bertie, and, it seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a, religious organisation to my own advantage, when I condemned them in the, abstract. It was a sore temptation, but I destroyed the letter.\\n\\nShe is a very well-read woman is the mother; she keeps up to date in, French literature as well as in English, and can talk by the hour about, the Goncourts, and Flaubert, and Gautier. Yet she is always hard at, work; and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery. She reads when, she knits, she reads when she scrubs, she even reads when she feeds, her babies. We have a little joke against her, that at an interesting, passage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little, sister's car-hole, the child having turned her head at the critical, instant. Her hands are worn with work, and yet where is the idle woman, who has read as much?\\n\\nHe was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves, then His, existence loses its point, since we and He start upon a different basis., To my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty, and the moral of His life. If He was divine then He COULD not sin, and, there was an end of the matter. We who are not divine and can sin, have, little to learn from a life like that.\\\"\\n\\nWell, this began to look more like business--especially that last, sentence. I took it to Horton, and asked his advice. His opinion was, that I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. So it ended by my, wiring back accepting the partnership--if it is a partnership--and, to-morrow morning I am off to Bradfield with great hopes and a small, portmanteau. I know how interested you are in the personality of, Cullingworth--as every one is who comes, even at second hand, within, range of his influence; and so you may rely upon it that I shall give, you a very full and particular account of all that passes between us. I, am looking forward immensely to seeing him again, and I trust we won't, have any rows.\\n\\nThis was getting too hot, Bertie. I saw all the folly of the thing. I, believed that I might whip him; but at the same time I knew that we were, so much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without, any possible object to serve. For all that, I took my gloves off, and I, think perhaps it was the wisest course after all. If Cullingworth, once thought he had the whiphand of you, you might be sorry for it, afterwards.\\n\\nPoor Whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony. He was staggering, under the weight of a fine Japanese cabinet which he had carried round, from his lodgings. I had asked him to come to the church, and the old, gentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie. Between, ourselves, I had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should, upset him, as in the case of the dinner; but nothing could be more, exemplary than his conduct and appearance. I had introduced him to, Winnie some days before.\\n\\n\\\"Pray step in,\\\" I answered, and waved him into the consulting-room. He, was a pompous, heavy-stepping, thick-voiced sort of person, but to me he, was an angel from on high. I was nervous, and at the same time so afraid, that he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me, that I, found myself drifting into an extravagant geniality. He seated himself, at my invitation and gave a husky cough.\\n\\nyou and I, and have done ever since I have known you. You are true, to your faith, I to my reason--you to your family belief, I to my own, ideas; but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man, and, his affinity for others, depends upon quite other things than views on, abstract questions. Anyway, I can say with all my heart that I wish I, saw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth, sitting, in that ricketty American-leather armchair, with the villanous, lodging-house antimacassar over the back of it. It is good of you to, tell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures; though if I, had not KNOWN that you were so, you may be sure that I should never have, ventured to inflict any of them upon you. My future is now all involved, in obscurity, but it is obvious that the first thing I must do is to, find a fitting house, and my second to cajole the landlord into letting, me enter into possession of it without any prepayment. To that I will, turn myself to-morrow morning, and you shall know the result. Whom, should I hear from the other day but Archie McLagan? Of course it was a, begging letter. You can judge how far I am in a state to lose money; but, in a hot fit I sent him ten shillings, which now, in my cold, I bitterly, regret. With every good wish to you and yours, including your town, your, State, and your great country, yours as ever.\\n\\nI am sure, a most extraordinary figure. Indeed, she looked rather funny, herself, with her palette in one hand, her brush in the other, and the, blank astonishment on her face. I stammered out something about hoping, that she did not mind, which made her more angry than ever. \\\"The, only possible excuse for your conduct, sir, is that you are under the, influence of drink,\\\" said she. \\\"I need not say that we do not require, the services of a medical man in that condition.\\\" I did not try to, disabuse her of the idea, for really I could see no better explanation;, so I beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition. She wrote a letter, to my father about it in the evening, and the old man was very angry, indeed. As to the mother, she is as staunch as steel, and quite prepared, to prove that poor Mrs. A. was a very deep designing person, who had, laid a trap for innocent Johnnie. So there has been a grand row; and not, a soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means, except only, yourself as you read this letter.\\n\\nThen down a winding wooden stair to the basement, where were kitchen, and scullery, dimly lit, and asphalt-floored. As I entered the latter I, stood staring. In every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me., The place was a Golgotha! In that half light the effect was sepulchral., But as I approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished., They were of plaster-of-Paris, and were the leavings evidently of the, dentist, who had been the last tenant. A more welcome sight was a huge, wooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner. It only, wanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room.\\n\\n, The letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so, connected a whole, and to give so plain an account of some of the, troubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the, outset of his career, that I have handed them over to the gentleman who, is about to edit them. There are two of them, the fifth and the ninth\\n\\nand it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing--but then, would come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my, ledger. Where did it come from you will ask. Some from old Whitehall and, his circle of Bohemians. Some from accident cases. Some from new comers, to the town who drifted to me. Some from people whom I met first in, other capacities. An insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to, examine, and that was a very great help. Above all, I learned a fact, which I would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts, as I, have done, a stranger among strangers. Do not think that practice will, come to you. You must go to it. You may sit upon your consulting room, chair until it breaks under you, but without purchase or partnership you, will make little or no progress. The way to do it is to go out, to mix, everywhere with men, to let them know you. You will come back many a, time and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for, you in your absence. Never mind! Go out again. A noisy smoking concert, where you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two, whom you might have seen at home. It took me some time to realise, but I, speak now as one who knows.\\n\\nWait a bit, though! One did. I was awakened at six in the morning one, day by a ringing at my bell, and creeping to the angle of the stair, I saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a top-hat outside. Much, excited, with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head, I ran, back, pulled on some clothes, rushed down, opened the door, and found, myself in the grey morning light face to face with Horton. The good, fellow had come down from Merton in an excursion train, and had been, travelling all night. He had an umbrella under his arm, and two great, straw baskets in each hand, which contained, when unpacked, a cold leg, of mutton, half-a-dozen of beer, a bottle of port, and all sorts of, pasties and luxuries. We had a great day together, and when he rejoined, his excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he, had found.\\n\\neven when we know each other as well as I know you. Why should we, when, that which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of, advance from friendship to intimacy, and from intimacy to something, more sacred still, which can scarcely be written at all, far less made, interesting to another? The time came at last when they were to leave, Birchespool, and my mother and I went round the night before to say, goodbye. Winnie and I were thrown together for an instant.\\n\\nsomebody will be hanged. Questions about this--questions about that. At, last they asked me what I proposed to fasten my magnet to. I answered, to any solid impenetrable object, such as the head of an Admiralty, official. Well, that broke the whole thing up. They wrote with their, compliments, and they were returning my apparatus. I wrote with my, compliments, and they might go to the devil. And so ends a great, historical incident, Munro--eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nBut the thing that took the fun out of him, and made him gnash his, teeth, and stride cursing about the room, was to see a patient walking, up the steps which led to the door of Scarsdale, his opposite neighbour., Scarsdale had a fairly busy practice, and received his people at home, from ten to twelve, so that I got quite used to seeing Cullingworth fly, out of his chair, and rush raving to the window. He would diagnose, the cases, too, and estimate their money value until he was hardly, articulate.\\n\\nquiet-voiced and gentle-mannered. You had only to see the way in which, she looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his, control, and that do what he might, or say what he might, it would, always be the best thing to her. She could be obstinate, too, in a, gentle, dove-like sort of way; but her obstinacy lay always in the, direction of backing up his sayings and doings. This, however, I was, only to find out afterwards; and at that, my first visit, she impressed, me as being one of the sweetest little women that I had ever known.\\n\\nand I felt much more cheery by the time I had finished my letter. I was, just addressing the envelope (observe what a continuous narrative you, get of my proceedings!) when I was set jumping out of my carpet slippers, by a ring at the bell. Through the glass panel I observed that it was a, respectable-looking bearded individual with a top-hat. It was a patient., It MUST be a patient! Then first I realised what an entirely different, thing it is to treat the patient of another man (as I had done with, Horton) or to work a branch of another man's practice (as I had done, with Cullingworth), and to have to do with a complete stranger on your, own account. I had been thrilling to have one. Now that he had come I, felt for an instant as if I would not open the door. But of course that, was only a momentary weakness. I answered his ring with, I fear, rather, a hypocritical air of insouciance, as though I had happened to find, myself in the hall, and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the, stairs.\\n\\nNext morning I came round to my house--MY house, my boy!--for good, and all, after paying off my landlady. Her bill came to more than I, expected, for I only had breakfast and tea, always \\\"dining out\\\" as I, majestically expressed it. However, it was a relief to me to get it, settled, and to go round with my box to Oakley Villas. An ironmonger had, fixed my plate on to the railings for half-a-crown the evening before\\n\\nWell, it was nearly six o'clock, and evening was just creeping in when, we drew up in Bradfield Station. The first thing I saw when I looked out, of the window was Cullingworth, exactly the same as ever, striding in, his jerky way down the platform, his coat flying open, his chin thrust, forward (he is the most under-hung man I have ever seen), and his great, teeth all gleaming, like a good-natured blood-hound. He roared with, delight when he saw me, wrung my hand, and slapped me enthusiastically, upon the shoulder.\\n\\nAnd certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin, laying down laws about the future; for how do we know that there are not, phases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception?, After all, a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average, life is of the period during which we know that the world has been in, existence. But if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight, his, son the same, and his son the same, what would their united experiences, after a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call, night? So all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth, is not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception.\\n\\n\\\"There are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of, handling patients,\\\" he remarked, seating himself on the table and, swinging his legs. \\\"The most obvious is that you must never let them see, that you want them. It should be pure condescension on your part seeing, them at all; and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it, the, more they think of it. Break your patients in early, and keep them well, to heel. Never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many, foolish young men fall into this habit, and are ruined in consequence., Now, this is my form\\\"--he sprang to the door, and putting his two hands, to his mouth he bellowed: \\\"Stop your confounded jabbering down there! I, might as well be living above a poultry show! There, you see,\\\" he added, to me, \\\"they will think ever so much more of me for that.\\\"\\n\\nand skims plates out of the window at the passers-by. Of course, it is, really not funny, but pathetic and deplorable--all the same, it is hard, to keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and, her appearance. I was called in by accident in the first instance; but I, speedily acquired some control over her, so that now the neighbours send, for me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window. She, has a fair competence, so that her little vagaries are a help to me with, my rent. She has, too, a number of curious jugs, statues, and pictures\\n\\nWell, I know that I am a shocking bad story-teller, but I just try to, get things as near the truth as I can manage it. If I only knew how to, colour it up, I could make some of this better reading. I can get along, when I am on one line, but it is when I have to bring in a second line, of events that I understand what C. means when he says that I will never, be able to keep myself in nibs by what I earn in literature.\\n\\nOnce he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge, shop, a place that had been a raper's, with a counter about sixty feet, long. His reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a, little further down on the other side. Poor old \\\"armed transport\\\" worked, so hard that I could not help being touched and grateful; yet I longed, from my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent\\n\\n, Birchespool is really a delightful place, dear Bertie; and I ought to, know something about it, seeing that I have padded a good hundred miles, through its streets during the last seven days. Its mineral springs used, to be quite the mode a century or more ago; and it retains many traces, of its aristocratic past, carrying it with a certain grace, too, as an, emigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled, in Versailles. I forget the new roaring suburbs with their out-going, manufactures and their incoming wealth, and I live in the queer, health-giving old city of the past. The wave of fashion has long passed, over it, but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind., In the High Street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the, railings where the link-boys used to put out their torches, instead of, stamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement, as was the custom, in less high-toned quarters. There are the very high curbstones too\\n\\n\\\"But what is mother to do?\\\" cried the girl, taking up the tale again., \\\"No hotel or lodging-house would take us in while poor Fred is like, that. And we have not the heart to send him to an asylum. Uncle will not, have us any longer, and we have nowhere to go to.\\\" Her grey eyes tried, to look brave, but her mouth would go down at the corners.\\n\\nis either extinct or on the way towards it. Struma, tubercle, nervous, disease, have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten, branch, and the average of the race is thereby improved. I believe from, the little that I have seen of life, that it is a law which acts with, startling swiftness, that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate, their species at all, and that when the curse is hereditary, the second, generation generally sees the end of it.\\n\\n\\\"We must do what we can to make up. Now, I tell you what I am prepared, to do. I was talking about it with Hetty this morning, and she thought, as I did. If we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your, legs under you, it would encourage you to start for yourself, and you, could pay it back as soon as you were able.\\\"\\n\\nIf Cullingworth still bore any resentment, he concealed it most, admirably. But then I knew by experience that that genial loud-voiced, John-Bull manner of his COULD conceal many things. His wife was more, open; and I could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes, that, she at least stood fast to the old quarrel. Cullingworth was little, changed, and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we'll see about that when they do. Meanwhile I am paying ready, money for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps. They think so, well of me here that I could have had the whole place furnished like a, palace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff, only I determined to take, each room in turn when I was ready for it. There's nearly four hundred, pounds under this one ceiling.\\\"\\n\\nStill I must confess that there is nothing about Cullingworth which jars, me so much as the low view which he takes of our profession. I can never, reconcile myself to his ideas, and yet I can never convert him to mine;, so there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide, us altogether. He will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the, question. A profession, in his view, is a means of earning a livelihood\\n\\n\\\"Very good. You are also aware, I presume, that modern projectiles are, either made of or tipped with steel. It may possibly have come to your, ears that magnets attract steel. Permit me now to show you a small, experiment.\\\" He bent over his apparatus, and I suddenly heard the, snapping of electricity. \\\"This,\\\" he continued going across to the, packing case, \\\"is a saloon pistol, and will be exhibited in the museums, of the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was, inaugurated. Into the breech I place a Boxer cartridge, specialty, provided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet. I aim point, blank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall, which is four inches, above the magnet. I am an absolutely dead shot. I fire. You will now, advance, and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end, of the magnet, after which you will apologise to me for that grin.\\\"\\n\\nHeigh ho! it's nearly dawn, and I as wakeful as ever. It is chilly, and, I have draped a blanket round me. I've heard that this is the favourite, hour of the suicide, and I see that I've been tailing off in the, direction of melancholy myself. Let me wind up on a lighter chord by, quoting Cullingworth's latest article. I must tell you that he is, still inflamed by the idea of his own paper, and his brain is in full, eruption, sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs\\n\\nwe are too apt to overlook the ninety-nine decent folk by their own, firesides. I shall not make that mistake any more. The kindliness of the, poor to the poor makes a man sick of himself. And their sweet patience!, Depend upon it, if ever there is a popular rising, the wrongs which lead, to it must be monstrous and indefensible. I think the excesses of the, French Revolution are dreadful enough in themselves, but much more so as, an index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad, protest. And then the wisdom of the poor! It is amusing to read the glib, newspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses. They don't, know the date of Magna Charta, or whom John of Gaunt married; but put, a practical up-to-date problem before them, and see how unerringly they, take the right side. Didn't they put the Reform Bill through in the, teeth of the opposition of the majority of the so-called educated, classes? Didn't they back the North against the South when nearly all, our leaders went wrong? When universal arbitration and the suppression, of the liquor traffic comes, is it not sure to be from the pressure of, these humble folks? They look at life with clearer and more unselfish, eyes. It's an axiom, I think, that to heighten a nation's wisdom you, must lower its franchise.\\n\\nWhen I woke next morning he was in my room, and a funny-looking object, he was. His dressing-gown lay on a chair, and he was putting up a, fifty-six pound dumb-bell, without a rag to cover him. Nature didn't, give him a very symmetrical face, nor the sweetest of expressions; but, he has a figure like a Greek statue. I was amused to see that both his, eyes had a touch of shadow to them. It was his turn to grin when I, sat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a, toadstool. However, he was all for peace that morning, and chatted away, in the most amiable manner possible.\\n\\nand began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the, three hundred spectators. It was fine to see the deliberate way in which, he picked his way among the ink bottles. As he sprang down from the last, bench on to the floor, his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in, the face. Cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him, however, and rushed, him backwards out of the class-room. What he did with him I don't know\\n\\nI was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this, rigmarole. When he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box, and, we could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair. I, was still looking at the medal, which, from the dents all over it, had, evidently been often used as a target, when I felt a timid touch upon my, sleeve; it was Mrs. Cullingworth, who was looking earnestly at me with a, very distressed expression upon her face.\\n\\nfor you could never tell what it might lead to. His temper was nothing, less than infernal. I have seen him in the dissecting-rooms begin to, skylark with a fellow, and then in an instant the fun would go out of, his face, his little eyes would gleam with fury, and the two would be, rolling, worrying each other like dogs, below the table. He would, be dragged off, panting and speechless with fury, with his wiry hair, bristling straight up like a fighting terrier's.\\n\\nwhich was as welcome to me, and as much of a windfall, as the Spanish, wreck to Robinson Crusoe. There were too pairs of thick blankets, two, sheets, a counterpane, a pillow, a camp-stool, two stuffed bears' paws, (of all things in this world!), two terra-cotta vases, a tea-cosy, two, pictures in frames, several books, an ornamental ink-pot, and a number, of antimacassars and coloured tablecloths. It is not until you own a, table with a deal top and mahogany legs, that you understand what the, true inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is. Right on the top of this, treasure came a huge hamper from the Apothecaries' Society with the, drugs which I had ordered. When they were laid out in line, the bottles, extended right down one side of the dining-room and half down the other., As I walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions, I, felt less radical in my views, and begun to think that there might be, something in the rights of property after all.\\n\\nas they do in the mediaeval churches, he might, I am sure, paper, his consulting room with them. A favourite device of his with an, impressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure. \\\"My, dear,\\\" he will say, swaying some girl about by the shoulders, with his, nose about three inches from hers, \\\"you'll feel better to-morrow at a, quarter to ten, and at twenty past you'll be as well as ever you were in, your life. Now, keep your eye on the clock, and see if I am not right.\\\", Next day, as likely as not, her mother will be in, weeping tears of, joy; and another miracle has been added to Cullingworth's record. It may, smell of quackery, but it is exceedingly useful to the patient.\\n\\nIn the meantime I had enlisted a most unexpected ally. On the second, evening a card was solemnly brought up by the landlady's daughter from, the lodger who occupied the room below. On it was inscribed \\\"Captain, Whitehall\\\"; and then underneath, in brackets, \\\"Armed Transport.\\\" On, the back of the card was written, \\\"Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), presents his compliments to Dr. Munro, and would be glad of his, company to supper at 8.30.\\\" To this I answered, \\\"Dr. Munro presents his, compliments to Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), and will be most, happy to accept his kind invitation.\\\" What \\\"Armed Transport\\\" might mean, I had not an idea, but I thought it well to include it, as he seemed so, particular about it himself.\\n\\nFirst of all, about the practice. I told you that I was to have a room, immediately opposite to Cullingworth's, and that all the surgical cases, were to be turned over to me. For a few days I had nothing to do, except, to listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients, or making, speeches to them from the top of the stairs. However, a great \\\"Dr. Stark, Munro, Surgeon,\\\" has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs\\n\\nTalking of cheeriness, you misunderstand me, Bertie, if you think (as, you seem to imply) that I take a dark view of things. It is true that I, discard some consolations which you possess, because I cannot convince, myself that they are genuine; but in this world, at least, I see immense, reason for hope, and as to the next I am confident that all will be for, the best. From annihilation to beatification I am ready to adapt myself, to whatever the great Designer's secret plan my be.\\n\\nSo the Cullingworths did their bag-procession through the doctors', quarter alone to-day, and I walked to the park, where I sat down on one, of the seats, lit a cigar, and thought the whole matter over. I was down, on my luck at first; but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the, budding flowers soon set me right again. I began my last letter among, the stars, and I am inclined to finish this one among the flowers, for, they are rare companions when one's mind is troubled. Most things on, this earth, from a woman's beauty to the taste of a nectarine, seem to, be the various baits with which Nature lures her silly gudgeons. They, shall eat, they shall propagate, and for the sake of pleasing themselves, they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them. But, there lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower. It's charm, has no ulterior motive.\\n\\nAnd this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair., Cullingworth, who had drunk off a couple of glasses, waited until his, wife had left the room, and then began to talk of the difficulty of, getting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of, patients. This led us round to the ways in which a man might take his, exercise indoors, and that to boxing. Cullingworth took a couple of, pairs of gloves out of a cupboard, and proposed that we should fight a, round or two then and there.\\n\\nNow, first of all, I want to tell you about how the practice has been, going on. The week after I wrote last showed a slight relapse. I only, took two pounds. But on the next I took a sudden jump up to three pounds, seven shillings, and this last week I took three pounds ten. So it was, steadily creeping up; and I really thought that I saw my road clear, in front of me, when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue. There were, reasons, however, which prevented my being very disappointed when it did, come down; and these I must make clear to you.\\n\\nWell, with half-an-hour for lunch, this extraordinary business went, on till a quarter to four in the afternoon. When the last patient had, departed, Cullingworth led the way into the dispensary, where all the, fees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value., There were seventeen half-sovereigns, seventy-three shillings, and, forty-six florins; or thirty-two pounds eight and sixpence in all., Cullingworth counted it up, and then mixing the gold and silver into, one heap, he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it., Finally, he raked it into the canvas bag which I had seen the night, before, and lashed the neck up with a boot-lace.\\n\\nWell, she had heard some details about the Cullingworths which, displeased her when I first knew them. Then came the smash-up at, Avonmouth, and my mother liked them less and less. She was averse to my, joining them in Bradfield, and it was only by my sudden movement at the, end that I escaped a regular prohibition. When I got there, the very, first question she asked (when I told her of their prosperity) was, whether they had paid their Avonmouth creditors. I was compelled to, answer that they had not. In reply she wrote imploring me to come away\\n\\nHis wisdom, His forethought for small wants, His providing of luxuries, for His creatures. On the other hand, do not let us be disingenuous, enough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain, in cruelty, in all which, seems to be a slur upon His work. The best that we can say for them is, to hope that they are not as bad as they seem, and possibly lead to some, higher end. The voices of the ill-used child and of the tortured animal, are the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer.\\n\\nwhen the main trunk is rotten beneath them, and both must in their, present forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin. The movement, of human thought, though slow, is still in the direction of truth, and, the various religions which man sheds as he advances (each admirable in, its day) will serve, like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel, to, give the rate and direction of his progress.\\n\\nAnd now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole, life. Whom do you think I had a letter from last Tuesday week? From, Cullingworth, no less. It had no beginning, no end, was addressed, all wrong, and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a, prescription. How it ever reached me is a wonder. This is what he had to, say:--\\n\\nseemed to fall away, and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable, Guide of the Universe were for an instant face to face. I was on my, knees--hurled down all against my own will, as it were. And even then, I could find no words to say. Only vague yearnings and emotions and a, heartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good. What could, I say? Every prayer seemed based on the idea that God was a magnified, man--that He needed asking and praising and thanking. Should the cog of, the wheel creak praise to the Engineer? Let it rather cog harder, and, creak less. Yet I did, I confess, try to put the agitation of my soul, into words. I meant it for a prayer; but when I considered afterwards, the \\\"supposing thats\\\" and \\\"in case ofs\\\" with which it was sprinkled, it, must have been more like a legal document. And yet I felt soothed and, happier as I went downstairs again.\\n\\nI have often wondered why some of those writing fellows don't try their, hands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of, puberty until he begins to find his feet a little. Men are very fond, of analysing the feelings of their heroines, which they cannot possibly, know anything about, while they have little to say of the inner, development of their heroes, which is an experience which they have, themselves undergone. I should like to try it myself, but it would need, blending with fiction, and I never had a spark of imagination. But I, have a vivid recollection of what I went through myself. At the time I, thought (as everybody thinks) that it was a unique experience; but since, I have heard the confidences of my father's patients I am convinced that, it is the common lot. The shrinking, horrible shyness, alternating with, occasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against, it, the longing for close friendship, the agonies over imaginary, slights, the extraordinary sexual doubts, the deadly fears caused by, non-existent diseases, the vague emotion produced by all women, and the, half-frightened thrill by particular ones, the aggressiveness caused, by fear of being afraid, the sudden blacknesses, the profound, self-distrust--I dare bet that you have felt every one of them, Bertie\\n\\nis pronounced by Dr. Stark Munro, of Oakley Villa, to have suffered no, serious injury.\\\" As Cullingworth used to say, it is hard enough for the, young doctor to push his name into any publicity, and he must take what, little chances he has. Perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake, their heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal; but, I was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing, their own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in The, Times.\\n\\nYou'll see from the address of this letter, Bertie, that I have left, Scotland and am in Yorkshire. I have been here three months, and am now, on the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the, queerest prospects. Good old Cullingworth has turned out a trump, as I, always knew he would. But, as usual, I am beginning at the wrong end, so, here goes to give you an idea of what has been happening.\\n\\nWhat should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture, submitted to him, and who, having satisfied himself that the account, given of the painting of the picture is incorrect, at once concludes, that no one ever painted it, or at least asserts that he has no possible, means of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not? That is, as, it seems to me, a fair statement of the position of some of the more, extreme agnostics. \\\"Is not the mere existence of the picture in itself, a proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it? one might ask.\\\", \\\"Why, no,\\\" says the objector. \\\"It is possible that the picture produced, itself by the aid of certain rules. Besides, when the picture was first, submitted to me I was assured that it had all been produced within a, week, but by examining it I am able to say with certainty that it has, taken a considerable time to put together. I am therefore of opinion, that it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all.\\\"\\n\\nSo ends the history of a failure. I am, as you know, inclined to, fatalism, and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists; so I am, bound to think that this experience was given to me for some end. It, was a preliminary canter for the big race, perhaps. My mother was, disappointed, but tried to show it as little as possible. My father, was a little sardonic over the matter. I fear that the gap between us, widens. By the way, an extraordinary card arrived from Cullingworth, during my absence. \\\"You are my man,\\\" said he; \\\"mind that I am to have, you when I want you.\\\" There was no date and no address, but the postmark, was Bradfield in the north of England. Does it mean nothing? Or may it, mean everything? We must wait and see.\\n\\n, Well, the second person whom I admitted through my door was the High, Church curate of the parish--at least, I deduced High Church from his, collar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain. He seemed to be, a fine upstanding manly fellow--in fact, I am bound in honesty to admit, that I have never met the washy tea-party curate outside the pages of, Punch. As a body, I think they would compare very well in manliness (I, do not say in brains) with as many young lawyers or doctors. Still, I, have no love for the cloth. Just as cotton, which is in itself the most, harmless substance in the world, becomes dangerous on being dipped into, nitric acid, so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once, soaked in sectarian religion. If he has any rancour or hardness in him, it will bring it out. I was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my, visitor, though I trust that I received him with fitting courtesy. The, quick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my, consulting-room, told me that it was not quite what he had expected.\\n\\nMy red drugget I laid out in the centre, and fastened it down with, brass-headed nails. It looked much smaller than I had hoped,--a little, red island on an ocean of deal board, or a postage stamp in the middle, of an envelope. In the centre of it I placed my table, with three, medical works on one side of it, and my stethoscope and dresser's case, upon the other. One chair went with the table, of course; and then I, spent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other, two looked better together--a dense block of chairs, as it were--or, scattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous, chairs. I placed them finally one on the right, and one in front of, the table. Then I put down my fender, and nailed \\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo, Players,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle\\\" on to three of the walls, with the mental, promise that my first spare half-crown should buy a picture for the, fourth. In the window I placed my little square table, and balanced upon, it a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which I, had brought in my trunk. Finally, I found a pair of dark brown curtains, among the job lot which I had bought at the sale, and these I put up and, drew pretty close together, so that a subdued light came into the room\\n\\nwith the bustle of green tree tops. It was a windy day, and the clouds, were drifting swiftly across the heavens, with glimpses of blue between., I don't know how it was, but as I stood looking through the grimy panes, in the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my, responsibility to some higher power came upon me, with a vividness which, was overpowering. Here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened., What was to be the end of it? I had strength, I had gifts. What was I, going to do with them? All the world, the street, the cabs, the houses\\n\\nYou'll wonder what has taken me off on this line. Only that I seem, to see it all in action in my own life. But, as usual, I have started, merrily off with an appendix, so I shall go back and begin my report, as nearly as possible where I ended the last. First of all, I may, say generally that the clouds were thinning then, and that they broke, shortly afterwards. During the last few months we have never once quite, lost sight of the sun.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, curse the politics! Red pepper well rubbed in, that's my idea of a, paper. Call it the Scorpion. Chaff the Mayor and the Council until they, call a meeting and hang themselves. I'd do the snappy paragraphs, and, you would do the fiction and poetry. I thought about it during the, night, and Hetty has written to Murdoch's to get an estimate for the, printing. We might get our first number out this day week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you've got your armour there, laddie, it will be pierced,\\\" says he., \\\"Put up forty feet thick of steel; and I'll build a gun that will knock, it into tooth-powder. It would blow away, and set the folk coughing, after I had one shot at it. But you can't pierce armour which only drops, after the shot has passed through. What's the good of it? Why it, keeps out the water. That's the main thing, after all. I call it the, Cullingworth spring-shutter screen. Eh, what, Munro? I wouldn't take, a quarter of a million for the idea. You see how it would work. Spring, shutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks, used to be. They are in sections, three feet broad, we will say, and, capable when let down of reaching the keel. Very well! Enemy sends a, shot through Section A of the side. Section A shutter is lowered. Only, a thin film, you see, but enough to form a temporary plug. Enemy's ram, knocks in sections B, C, D of the side. What do you do? Founder? Not, a bit; you lower sections B, C, and D of Cullingworth's spring-shutter, screen. Or you knock a hole on a rock. The same thing again. It's a, ludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution, would absolutely save her. And it's equally good for ironclads also. A, shot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them., Down go your shutters, and all is well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I could. Such a novel, Munro, that when they'd read the first, chapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out., They'd wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was, coming next. By Crums, I'll go and begin it now!\\\" And, with another, somersault over the end of the bed, he rushed from the room, with the, tassels of his dressing gown flying behind him.\\n\\nhis guards, and his cellars of wine in a more logical position. They are, all good and talented men, and in the market of brains are worth perhaps, as much as they get. But how can they bring themselves to pose as the, representatives of a creed, which, as they themselves expound it, is, based upon humility, poverty, and self-denial? Not one of them who, would not quote with approval the parable of the Wedding Guest. But, try putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next Court, reception. It happened some little time ago with a Cardinal, and England, rang with his protests. How blind not to see how they would spring at, one leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim, the last as the special badge of their master!\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said I, \\\"that's easily set right.\\\" I marched out of the room and, downstairs, with both Cullingworth and his wife behind me. Into the yard, I went, and, picking up a big hammer, I started for the front door, with, the pair still at my heels. I got the forked end of the hammer under my, plate, and with a good wrench I brought the whole thing clattering on to, the pavement.\\n\\nBut if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its, honey bag and its collecting forceps, and for the lowly seed so as to, have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil, then is it, conceivable that we, the highest product of all, are overlooked? It is, NOT conceivable. The idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as, we see it. I say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty, of a most watchful Providence.\\n\\nI'll give you an idea of what a day's work is like. We breakfast about, nine o'clock, and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to, drop in. Many of them are very poor people, belonging to the colliery, clubs, the principle of which is, that the members pay a little over a, halfpenny a week all the year round, well or ill, in return for which, they get medicine and attendance free. \\\"Not much of a catch for the, doctors,\\\" you would say, but it is astonishing what competition there, is among them to get the appointment. You see it is a certainty for, one thing, and it leads indirectly to other little extras. Besides, it, amounts up surprisingly. I have no doubt that Horton has five or six, hundred a year from his clubs alone. On the other hand, you can imagine, that club patients, since they pay the same in any case, don't let their, ailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room.\\n\\nCullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper. He has carried, the matter through with his usual energy, but he doesn't know enough, about local affairs to be able to write about them, and it is a question, whether he can interest the people here in anything else. At present we, are prepared to run the paper single-handed; we are working seven hours, a day at the practice; we are building a stable; and in our odd hours we, are practising at our magnetic ship-protector, with which Cullingworth, is still well pleased, though he wants to get it more perfect before, submitting it to the Admiralty.\\n\\nWas it not fine? It stirred my blood, and the words rang like a bugle, call in my head. It braced me, and the time was coming when all the, bracing I could get would not be too much. I copied it out, and pinned, it on one side of my mantel-piece. On the other I stuck up a chip from, Carlyle, which I daresay is as familiar to you as to me. \\\"One way or, another all the light, energy, and available virtue which we have does, come out of us, and goes very infallibly into God's treasury, living and, working through eternities there. We are not lost--not a single atom, of us--of one of us.\\\" Now, there is a religious sentence which is, intellectually satisfying, and therefore morally sound.\\n\\nWell, I really never intended to inflict all this upon you, Bertie. I, thought I could have made my position clear in a page or so. But you can, see how one point has brought up another. Even now I am leaving so much, unsaid. I can see with such certainty exactly what you will say. \\\"If, you deduce a good Providence from the good things in nature, what do, you make of the evil?\\\" That's what you will say. Suffice it that I am, inclined to deny the existence of evil. Not another word will I say upon, the subject; but if you come back to it yourself, then be it on your own, head.\\n\\nTo some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them, to say one. With a loud \\\"hush\\\" he would rush at them, thump them on the, chests, listen to their hearts, write their labels, and then run them, out of the room by their shoulders. One poor old lady he greeted with a, perfect scream. \\\"You've been drinking too much tea!\\\" he cried. \\\"You are, suffering from tea poisoning!\\\" Then, without allowing her to get a word, in, he clutched her by her crackling black mantle, dragged her up to the, table, and held out a copy of \\\"Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence\\\" which was, lying there. \\\"Put your hand on the book,\\\" he thundered, \\\"and swear that, for fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa.\\\" She swore with, upturned eyes, and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand\\n\\nIs he not a conundrum? If he interests you at a distance (and I take, for granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional, compliment) you can think how piquant he is in actual life. I must, confess, however, that I can never shake off the feeling that I am, living with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may, possibly bite. Well, it won't be very long before I write again, and, by that time I shall probably know whether I am likely to find, any permanent billet here or not. I am so sorry to hear about Mrs., Swanborough's indisposition. You know that I take the deepest interest, in everything that affects you. They tell me here that I am looking very, fit, though I think they ought to spell it with an \\\"a.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you, Bertie, the tears started to my eyes, and I could hardly, gulp out a word or two of thanks. What a crisscross of qualities in, one human soul! It was not the deed or the words; but it was the almost, womanly look in the eyes of this broken, drink-sodden old Bohemian--the, sympathy and the craving for sympathy which I read there. Only for an, instant though, for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half, defiant manner.\\n\\nwho leaned upon his Martini, with two little white kittens peeping over, either shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack. I was so moved at the, sight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old, country, that I sprang up on my box, took off my hat, and gave them, three cheers. At first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine, fashion--like a row of cows over a wall. At the second a good many, joined, and at the third my own voice was entirely lost. So I turned to, go my way, and the soldier laddies to go theirs; and I wondered which of, us had the stiffest and longest fight before us.\\n\\nDreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind, but I thought, of her nose and was reassured. An examination revealed everything. She, was a married woman. The lines were solemnly produced. Her husband was a, seaman. She had passed as a miss, because she thought I was more likely, to take a housekeeper without encumbrances. Her husband had come home, unexpectedly from a long voyage, and had returned last night. And, then--plot within plot--the other woman was not her sister, but a, friend, whose name was Miss Williams. She thought I was more likely to, take two sisters than two friends. So we all came to know who the other, was; and I, having given Jack permission to remain, assigned the other, top room to Miss Williams. From absolute solitude I seemed to be rapidly, developing into the keeper of a casual ward.\\n\\nhowever, part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact, that whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort, his exact, opposite at once springs up to neutralise him. You have a Mameluke: up, jumps a Crusader. You have a Fenian: up jumps an Orangeman. Every force, has its recoil. And so these more hide-bound scientists must be set, against those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in, the year 4004 B. C.\\n\\nI had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me, into the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as, to our financial position. He began the interview by unbuttoning his, waistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space, two, inches from the left sternal line. I did so, and was shocked to hear a, well-marked mitral regurgitant murmur.\\n\\nIf I hadn't been a fool, Bertie, I should never have consented. It's, one of my many weaknesses, that, whether it's a woman or a man, anything, like a challenge sets me off. But I knew Cullingworth's ways, and I told, you in my last what a lamb of a temper he has. None the less, we pushed, back the table, put the lamp on a high bracket, and stood up to one, another.\\n\\nfor it was merely a prospecting expedition, and I intended to return for, my luggage if I saw reason for hope. Alas! there was not the faintest., The sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that, ever lived. It is one of those picturesque little English towns with, a history and little else. A Roman trench and a Norman keep are its, principal products. But to me the most amazing thing about it was the, cloud of doctors which had settled upon it. A double row of brass plates, flanked the principal street. Where their patients came from I could not, imagine, unless they practised upon each other. The host of the \\\"Bull\\\", where I had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by, saying that, as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly, twelve miles in every direction, it was in these scattered farm-houses, that the Stockwell doctors found their patients. As I chatted with him a, middle-aged, dusty-booted man trudged up the street. \\\"There's Dr. Adam,\\\", said he. \\\"He's only a new-comer, but they say that some o' these days, he'll be starting his carriage.\\\" \\\"What do you mean by a new-comer?\\\", I asked. \\\"Oh, he's scarcely been here ten years,\\\" said the landlord., \\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"Can you tell me when the next train leaves for, Bradfield?\\\" So back I came, rather heavy at heart, and having spent, ten or twelve shillings which I could ill afford. My fruitless journey, seemed a small thing, however, when I thought of the rising Stockwellite, with his ten years and his dusty boots. I can trudge along a path\\n\\nand, as we are all very fond of the kind old lady, we were trying to, keep things as quiet as possible down-stairs. Suddenly there came, a bang! bang! bang! at the knocker; and then in an instant another, rattling series of knocks, as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick, in the panel. After all our efforts for silence it was exasperating. I, rushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand, to commence a fresh bombardment. \\\"What on earth's the matter?\\\" I asked\\n\\nBut there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man's heart, singing. Good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle., The race is improving. There are far fewer criminal convictions. There, is far more education. People sin less and think more. When I meet a, brutal looking fellow I often think that he and his type may soon be, as extinct as the great auk. I am not sure that in the interest of the, 'ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of Bill Sykes, to show, our children's children what sort of a person he was.\\n\\nI cannot be bigoted, my dear boy, when I say from the bottom of my heart, that I respect every good Catholic and every good Protestant, and that, I recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful, instrument in the hands of that inscrutable Providence which rules, all things. Just as in the course of history one finds that the most, far-reaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime; so in, religion, although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate, conception of the Creator and His ways, it may none the less be the very, best practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it. But, if it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to, adopt it, it is equally so for those to whom it is not, to protest, against it, until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets, gradually leavened, and pushed a little further upon their slow upward, journey.\\n\\nHowever, the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my, attention and breaking the blow which I had had in the Cullingworth, letter. It made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should, prove to be a patient, and the apparent patient an outsider. So back, I went, in a much more judicial frame of mind, to read that precious, document over again, and to make up my mind what it was that I should, do.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I had news of Cullingworth from Smeaton, who was in the, same football team at college, and who had called when he was passing, through Bradfield. His report was not a very favourable one. The, practice had declined considerably. People had no doubt accustomed, themselves to his eccentricities, and these had ceased to impress them., Again, there had been one or two coroner's inquests, which had spread, the impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs. If, the coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which Cullingworth had, effected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with, his censures. But, as you can understand, C.'s rival medical men, were not disposed to cover him in any way. He had never had much, consideration for them.\\n\\nWell, I examined him, and I found his own account not very far from the, truth. I went over him carefully from head to foot, and there was not, much left as Nature made it. He had mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of, the liver, Bright's disease, an enlarged spleen, and incipient dropsy., I gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance, if not of total, abstinence; but I fear that my words made no impression. He chuckled\\n\\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Cullingworth and I ran the practice together. As, a substitute for him I was a dreadful failure. They would not believe in, me in the least. I felt that I was as flat as water after champagne., I could not address them from the stairs, nor push them about, nor, prophesy to the anaeemic women. I was much too solemn and demure after, what they had been accustomed to. However, I held the thing together, as best I could, and I don't think that he found the practice much the, worse when he was able to take it over. I could not descend to what I, thought was unprofessional, but I did my very best to keep the wheels, turning.\\n\\ndebating, political, social, athletic, every one of them is a tool to, your hands. But you must show them what a good man you are. You must, throw yourself into each with energy and conviction. You will soon, find yourself on the committee--possibly the secretary, or even in the, presidential chair. Do not grudge labour where the return may be remote, and indirect. Those are the rungs up which one climbs.\\n\\nOur evening occupations just about that time were of a most, extraordinary character. You are aware that there is a substance, called, waxy matter, which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the, course of certain diseases. What this may be and how it is formed has, been a cause for much bickering among pathologists. Cullingworth had, strong views upon the subject, holding that the waxy matter was really, the same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver., But it is one thing to have an idea, and another to be able to prove, it. Above all, we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment. But, fortune favoured us in the most magical way. The Professor of Pathology, had come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition., With pride he exhibited the organ to us in the class-room before, ordering his assistant to remove it to the ice-chest, preparatory to its, being used for microscopical work in the practical class. Cullingworth, saw his chance, and acted on the instant. Slipping out of the classroom\\n\\nseemed to encourage him to become more offensive. At the end of the, match, wanting two to win, I put down the white which was in the jaws of, the pocket. He cried out that this was bad form. I contended that it was, folly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game, and, on, his continuing to make remarks, I appealed to the marker, who took the, same view as I did. This opposition only increased his anger, and he, suddenly broke out into most violent language, abusing me in unmeasured, terms. I said to him, \\\"If you have anything to say to me, Cullingworth\\n\\nwhich was certainly reasonable enough, since no one else could have, written it. Knowing Cullingworth as well as I did, I took it with, reservations and deductions. How could he have made so rapid and, complete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete, stranger? It was incredible. And yet there must be some truth in it, or, he would not invite me to come down and test it. On the whole, I thought, that I had better move very cautiously in the matter; for I was happy, and snug where I was, and kept on putting a little by, which I hoped, would form a nucleus to start me in practice. It is only a few pounds, up to date, but in a year or so it might mount to something. I wrote, to Cullingworth, therefore, thanking him for having remembered me, and, explaining how matters stood.\\n\\nhowever; and if you forced the pace in the morning, he would undress and, go to bed about tea-time, with a full conviction that all the clocks, had gone mad. These two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old, Whitehall had in his own words, \\\"thrown a rope\\\"; and long after I had, gone to bed I could hear the clink of their glasses, and the tapping of, their pipes against the fender in the room below.\\n\\nand use some remarkably bad English. The meaning of it, when all the, \\\"whereas's and aforesaids\\\" were picked out, was, that Winnie had about a, hundred a year of her own. It could not make me love her a shade better, than I did; but at the same time I won't be so absurd as to say that I, was not glad, or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it, would otherwise have been.\\n\\nHe had a dash of the heroic in him. On one occasion he was placed in, such a position that he must choose between compromising a lady, or, springing out of a third-floor window. Without a moment's hesitation he, hurled himself out of the window. As luck would have it, he fell through, a large laurel bush on to a garden plot, which was soft with rain, and, so escaped with a shaking and a bruising. If I have to say anything that, gives a bad impression of the man, put that upon the other side.\\n\\n, I have some recollection, my dear Bertie, that when I wrote you a, rambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago, I wound up, by saying that I might have something more interesting to tell you next, time. Well, so it has turned out! The whole game is up here, and I am, off upon a fresh line of rails altogether. Cullingworth is to go one, way and I another; and yet I am glad to say that there has not been any, quarrel between us. As usual, I have begun my letter at the end, but, I'll work up to it more deliberately now, and let you know exactly how, it came about.\\n\\nIf, Bertie, it had been old student days, I should have sailed straight, in, as you or any other fellow would have done. My flesh crept with my, loathing for the brute. But I had also to think of what I was and where, I was, and what I had come there to do. However, there are some things, which a man cannot stand, so I took a couple of steps forward, put my, hand on the fellow's shoulder, and said in as conciliatory and genial a, voice as I could muster: \\\"Come, come, my lad! Pull yourself together.\\\"\\n\\nThis with her funny manner set the ladies laughing, and the whole, business seemed lighter and easier. I promised to have the room ready, by eight o'clock. Mrs. La Force arranged to bring her son round at that, hour, and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than I deserved;, for after all it was a business matter, and a resident patient was the, very thing that I needed. I was able to assure Mrs. La Force that I, had had a similar case under my charge before--meaning, of course, poor, \\\"Jimmy,\\\" the son of Lord Saltire. Miss Williams escorted them to the, door, and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how I, got through with it, and that I was within sight of my carriage.\\n\\nI recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom, for fear of some imaginary infection. He was haunted, too, with a, perpetual dread of eavesdroppers, which used to make him fly at the door, and fling it open in the middle of his conversation, pouncing out into, the passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act. Once it was, the maid with the tea tray that he caught, I remember; and I can see her, astonished face now, with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar.\\n\\nYou remember that we (Paul and I) had just engaged a certain, Miss Williams to come and keep house for us. I felt that on the, basement-lodger principle I had not control enough; so we now entered, upon a more business-like arrangement, by which a sum (though, alas! an, absurdly small one) was to be paid her for her services. I would it had, been ten times as much, for a better and a more loyal servant man never, had. Our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she re-entered the, house.\\n\\nindirectly I may say that I did so. From that day Lady Saltire was as, rude to me as she could be, and never lost an opportunity of making, attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions. Of these I never, took the slightest notice; but at last on an evil day she went for me, point-blank, so that there was no getting away from her. It was just, at the end of lunch, when the footman had left the room. She had been, talking about Lord Saltire's going up to London to vote upon some, question in the House of Lords.\\n\\nBertie. I send you one or two enormously long letters, burdened, as far, as I can remember them, with all sorts of useless detail. Then, in spite, of your kindly answers and your sympathy, which I have done so little to, deserve, I drop you completely for more than six months. By this J pen, I swear that it shall not happen again; and this letter may serve to, bridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs, in which\\n\\nNo, you mustn't be too sure of that majority of yours. Taking the, scientific, the medical, the professional classes, I question whether it, exists at all. The clergy, busy in their own limited circles, and coming, in contact only with those who agree with them, have not realised how, largely the rising generation has outgrown them. And (with exceptions, like yourself) it is not the most lax, but the BEST of the younger men\\n\\n\\\"As to the magnet,\\\" said he, \\\"I'm very sorry for my country, but there, is no more command of the seas for her. I'll have to let the thing go, to the Germans. It's not my fault. They must not blame me when the smash, comes. I put the thing before the Admiralty, and I could have made a, board school understand it in half the time. Such letters, Munro! Colney, Hatch on blue paper. When the war comes, and I show those letters\\n\\nundisturbed. My tastes are so simple that I cannot imagine any advantage, which wealth can give--save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a, good man or a good cause. Why should people ever take credit for charity, when they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their, guineas in any other fashion? I gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster, the other day (having no change in my pocket), and the mater could not, quite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility. I, could have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one, nor the other, but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little, dash of swagger away down at the bottom of it. What had I ever had from, my chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow, brought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had, been useful?\\n\\nAnd so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that I could not, come. It is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life, obviously divides, and you take one turning or the other after vainly, trying to be sure about the finger-post. I think after all I chose, rightly. A ship's surgeon must remain a ship's surgeon, while here there, is no horizon to my possibilities.\\n\\n\\\"Just exactly in South America,\\\" he cried, pacing with his quick little, steps up and down the dingy room. \\\"Look here, laddie! There's a great, continent from the equator to the icebergs, and not a man in it who, could correct an astigmatism. What do they know of modern eye-surgery, and refraction? Why, dammy, they don't know much about it in the, provinces of England yet, let alone Brazil. Man, if you could only see, it, there's a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round, the whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for, an oculist. Eh, Munro, what? By Crums, I'll come back and I'll buy, Bradfield, and I'll give it away as a tip to a waiter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I'm sorry we haven't got a crowded day for you, Munro,\\\" said he., \\\"Of course, we can't command these things, and must take them as they, come. Now then, now then, make a gangway, can't you?\\\"--this to his, patients. \\\"Come here and see the waiting-room. Pooh! what an atmosphere!, Why on earth can't you open the windows for yourselves? I never saw, such folk! There are thirty people in this room, Munro, and not one with, sense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation.\\\"\\n\\nAt one end of Cadogan Terrace (where I am lodging) there is a wide open, space where several streets meet. In the centre of this stands a large, lamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal, a foot or so high, and ten, or twelve across. Well, as I strolled along I saw there was something, going on round this lamppost. A crowd of people had gathered, with a, swirl in the centre. I was, of course, absolutely determined not to get, mixed up in any row; but I could not help pushing my way through the, crowd to see what was the matter.\\n\\nYou met her, Bertie! You must remember her sweet face, her sensitive, mouth, her peering, short-sighted eyes, her general suggestion of a, plump little hen, who is still on the alert about her chickens. But you, cannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life. Those helpful, fingers! That sympathetic brain! Ever since I can remember her she has, been the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters\\n\\nhave it adopted in every civilised country, see all conceivable, applications of it, count up his probable royalties, sketch out the, novel methods in which he would invest his gains, and finally retire, with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed. And you would, be swept along by his words, and would be carried every foot of the, way with him, so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you, suddenly fell back to earth again, and found yourself trudging the city, street a poor student, with Kirk's Physiology under your arm, and hardly, the price of your luncheon in your pocket.\\n\\nHe began to laugh at that. \\\"It was a little precipitate on my part,\\\", said he; \\\"but I do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to, position or terms. You may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of, our client, Lord Saltire? Not? To put it briefly then, his son, the Hon., James Derwent, the heir to the estates and the only child, was struck, down by the sun while fishing without his hat last July. His mind has, never recovered from the shock, and he has been ever since in a chronic, state of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into, violent mania. His father will not allow him to be removed from, Lochtully Castle, and it is his desire that a medical man should stay, there in constant attendance upon his son. Your physical strength would, of course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which, I have spoken. The remuneration will be twelve pounds a month, and you, would be required to take over your duties to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nI assure you that I have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as, to whence I have come from, whither I am going, or what I am here for., It is not for want of inquiry, or from indifference. I have mastered, the principles of several religions. They have all shocked me by the, violence which I should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of, any one of them. Their ethics are usually excellent. So are the ethics, of the common law of England. But the scheme of creation upon which, those ethics are built! Well, it really is to me the most astonishing, thing that I have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage, that so many, able men, deep philosophers, astute lawyers, and clear-headed men of, the world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life. In the, face of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not, dare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul, were it not that, I take courage when I reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and, philosophers of Rome and Greece were all agreed that Jupiter had, numerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine.\\n\\nThat was how, when I had gained some sort of opening, I set to work to, enlarge it. I joined this. I joined that. I pushed in every direction., I took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health, and found, that the practice benefited as well as I. My cricket form for the season, has been fair, with an average of about 20 with the bat and 9 with the, ball.\\n\\nThose whom I love best are those who have least sympathy with my, struggles. They talk about having faith, as if it could be done by an, act of volition. They might as well tell me to have black hair instead, of red. I might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all, in religious matters. But I will never be traitor to the highest thing, that God has given me. I WILL use it. It is more moral to use it and go, wrong, than to forego it and be right. It is only a little foot-rule\\n\\nBesides this decline in his practice, I was sorry to hear that, Cullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion, which had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits., His whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it, but as far, back as I can remember it had been a characteristic. Even in those, early days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocer's shop\\n\\nAgain, out of three shutters which belonged to the room, I rigged up a, very effective side-table for my own den, which when covered with a, red cloth, and ornamented with the bears' paws, might have cost twenty, guineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary. I had done, all this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow, which I shall have to tell you about, came upon me.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand me, and quote me as saying that it is a good thing, for a nation that it should have many drunkards. Nothing of the kind., What I say is, that if a nation has many morally weak people, then it, is good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains., Nature has her devices, and drink is among them. When there are no more, drunkards and reprobates, it means that the race is so advanced that it, no longer needs such rough treatment. Then the all-wise Engineer will, speed us along in some other fashion.\\n\\nWell, my dear Bertie, a happy and tranquil, if not very ambitious, existence stretches before us. We are both in our twenty-fifth year, and, I suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirty-five more, years lie in front of us. I can foresee the gradually increasing routine, of work, the wider circle of friends, the indentification with this or, that local movement, with perhaps a seat on the Bench, or at least, in the Municipal Council in my later years. It's not a very startling, programme, is it? But it lies to my hand, and I see no other. I should, dearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my, presence. Even on this small stage we have our two sides, and something, might be done by throwing all one's weight on the scale of breadth\\n\\nI am quite ashamed of having been so didactic. But it is fine to think, that sin may have an object and work towards good. My father says that, I seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property, and can't be, happy until I know that all is right with it. Well, it does send a, glow through me when I seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the, clouds.\\n\\n\\\"Well, he's been dead seven years, and fifty nets dipping into his, little fish-pond. However, when I passed I thought my best move was to, come down to the old place, and see whether I couldn't piece the thing, together again. The name ought to be worth something, I thought. But it, was no use doing the thing in a half hearted way. Not a bit of use in, that, Munro. The kind of people who came to him were wealthy, and must, see a fine house and a man in livery. What chance was there of gathering, them into a bow-windowed forty pound-a-year house with a grubby-faced, maid at the door? What do you suppose I did? My boy, I took the, governor's old house, that was unlet--the very house that he kept up at, five thousand a year. Off I started in rare style, and sank my last cent, in furniture. But it's no use, laddie. I can't hold on any longer. I, got two accidents and an epileptic--twenty-two pounds, eight and, sixpence--that's the lot!\\n\\nBut every movement has its crowd of camp followers, who straggle and, scatter. We are like a comet, bright at the head but tailing away into, mere gas behind. However, every man may speak for himself, and I do, not feel that your charge comes home to me. I am only bigoted against, bigotry, and that I hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent., When one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct, has had during the history of the world; the bitter wars, Christian and, Mahomedan, Catholic and Protestant; the persecutions, the torturings\\n\\nI had an adventure upon the way to Bradfield. The carriage in which, I was travelling contained a party of three, at whom I took the most, casual of glances before settling down to the daily paper. There was an, elderly lady, with a bright rosy face, gold spectacles, and a dash of, red velvet in her bonnet. With her were two younger people, who I took, to be her son and her daughter--the one a quiet, gentle-looking girl of, twenty or so, dressed in black, and the other a short, thick-set young, fellow, a year or two older. The two ladies sat by each other in the, far corner, and the son (as I presume him to be) sat opposite me. We may, have travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to, this little family party, save that I could not help hearing some talk, between the two ladies. The younger, who was addressed as Winnie, had\\n\\nThat was the first of my morning incidents. My second followed hard upon, the heels of it. Another ring came, and from my post of observation I, saw that a gipsy's van, hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs, had, drawn up at the door. Two or three people appeared to be standing, outside. I understood that they wished me to purchase some of their, wares, so I merely opened the door about three inches, said \\\"No, thank, you,\\\" and closed it. They seemed not to have heard me for they rang, again, upon which I opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly., Imagine my surprise when they rang again. I flung the door open, and was, about to ask them what they meant by their impudence, when one of the, little group upon my doorstep said, \\\"If you please, sir, it's the baby.\\\", Never was there such a change--from the outraged householder to the, professional man. \\\"Pray step in, madam,\\\" said I, in quite my most, courtly style; and in they all came--the husband, the brother, the wife, and the baby. The latter was in the early stage of measles. They were, poor outcast sort of people, and seemed not to have sixpence among them;, so my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in, my giving the medicine for nothing, and finally adding fivepence in, coppers, which was all the small change I had. A few more such patients, and I am a broken man.\\n\\nwith ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me, left, so jauntily by the tax-collector, and meaning such a dead-weight pull to, me. The irony of my paying a poor-rate used to amuse me. I should have, been collecting it. Thrice at a crisis I pawned my watch, and thrice I, rallied and rescued it. But how am I to interest you in the details of, such a career? Now, if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on, a piece of orange peel before my door, or if the chief merchant in the, town had been saved by some tour-de-force upon my part, or if I had, been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely, house with a princely fee for silence--then I should have something, worthy of your attention. But the long months and months during which, I listened to the throb of the charwoman's heart and the rustle of the, greengrocer's lungs, present little which is not dull and dreary. No, good angels came my way.\\n\\nMy chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke, and I assure you that, I was within an ace of going over. Down like a pack of cards came all my, dreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to, Avonmouth. Yes, Bertie, I am bound to confess it: my first thought was, of my own disappointment, and my second of the misfortune of my friends., He had the most diabolical intuitions, or I a very tell-tale face, for, he added at once--\\n\\n\\\"What is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound.\\\" He shoots off, a whole column of aphorisms in a single evening. I should like to have, a man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste. No; you, must not let me give you a false impression of the man's capacity., On the other hand, it would be dishonest to deny that I think him, thoroughly unscrupulous, and full of very sinister traits. I am much, mistaken, however, if he has not fine strata in his nature. He is, capable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths.\\n\\nWell, as I said, my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down, into the bulb, when on looking through the gathering gloom I saw, \\\"Merton\\\" printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station. I got out, and, was standing beside my trunk and my hat-box, waiting for a porter, when, up came a cheery-looking fellow and asked me whether I was Dr. Stark, Munro. \\\"I'm Horton,\\\" said he; and shook hands cordially.\\n\\n, My dear old chap, things have been happening, and I must tell you all, about it. Sympathy is a strange thing; for though I never see you, the, mere fact that you over there in New England are keenly interested in, what I am doing and thinking, makes my own life in old England very much, more interesting to me. The thought of you is like a good staff in my, right hand.\\n\\nAnd now I have worked my way to the point where I can show you what I, mean when I talk about fate. The medical practitioner who lives next, me--Porter is his name--is a kindly sort of man, and knowing that I have, had a long uphill fight, he has several times put things in my way., One day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after, breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"There you are!\\\" he would suddenly yell; \\\"see that man with a limp!, Every morning he goes. Displaced semilunar cartilage, and a three, months' job. The man's worth thirty-five shillings a week. And there!, I'm hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isn't round in, her bath-chair again. She's all sealskin and lactic acid. It's simply, sickening to see how they crowd to that man. And such a man! You haven't, seen him. All the better for you. I don't know what the devil you are, laughing at, Munro. I can't see where the fun comes in myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you frankly, old chap,\\\" said he, putting on suddenly that, sort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a, sneer in it. \\\"You see, many of my patients are simple country folk, half, imbecile for the most part, but then the half-crown of an imbecile is, as good as any other half-crown. They come to my door, and they see two, names, and their silly jaws begin to drop, and they say to each other\\n\\nHave you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts? We had one, in Cullingworth's practice just before his illness, and we were both, much excited about it. They seem to me to be one of those wee little, chinks through which one may see deep into Nature's workings. In this, case the fellow, who was a clerk in the post office, came to us with a, swelling over his eyebrow. We opened it under the impression that it was, an abscess, and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth, in it. You know that such cases are common enough in surgery, and that, no pathological museum is without an example.\\n\\nYes, Horton is a real right-down good fellow. His heart is broad and, kind and generous. There is nothing petty in the man. He loves to see, those around him happy; and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red, face goes far to make them so. Nature meant him to be a healer; for he, brightens up a sick room as he did the Merton station when first I set, eyes upon him. Don't imagine from my description that he is in any, way soft, however. There is no one on whom one could be less likely to, impose. He has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased., A mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into, the surgery like a whiff of cast wind, his checks red, his whiskers, bristling, and his eyes malignant. The daybook is banged, the bottles, rattled, the counter thumped, and then he is off again with five doors, slamming behind him. We can trace his progress when the black mood is on, him by those dwindling slams. Perhaps it is that McCarthy has labelled, the cough mixture as the eye-wash, or sent an empty pillbox with an, exhortation to take one every four hours. In any case the cyclone comes, and goes, and by the next meal all is peace once more.\\n\\nThis is all a digression, however, from the fact that I have been six, months at home and am weary of it, and pleased at the new development, of which I shall have to tell you. The practice here, although, unremunerative, is very busy with its three-and-sixpenny visits and, guinea confinements, so that both the governor and I have had plenty, to do. You know how I admire him, and yet I fear there is little, intellectual sympathy between us. He appears to think that those, opinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my, inmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado. So, I have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him, and, though we affect, to ignore it, we both know that there is a barrier there. Now, with my, mother--ah, but my mother must have a paragraph to herself.\\n\\nThe inside of the house was even huger than I had thought from the look, of the exterior. There were over thirty bedrooms, Cullingworth informed, me, as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs. The hall and first, stair were most excellently furnished and carpetted, but it all run, to nothing at the landing. My own bedroom had a little iron bed, and a, small basin standing on a packing case. Cullingworth took a hammer from, the mantelpiece, and began to knock in nails behind the door.\\n\\nShortly afterwards Jack went away to sea again; and after his departure, there were several furious quarrels between the women down below, which, filled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees. At last one, evening Miss Williams--the quiet one--came to me and announced with sobs, that she must go. Mrs. Wotton made her life unbearable, she said. She, was determined to be independent, and had fitted up a small shop in a, poor quarter of the town. She was going now, at once, to take possession, of it.\\n\\nAnd with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an, elemental religion. Come what may after death, our duties lie clearly, defined before us in this life; and the ethical standard of all creeds, agrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion, as to that. The last reformation simplified Catholicism. The coming one, will simplify Protestantism. And when the world is ripe for it another, will come and simplify that. The ever improving brain will give us an, ever broadening creed. Is it not glorious to think that evolution, is still living and acting--that if we have an anthropoid ape as an, ancestor, we may have archangels for our posterity?\\n\\n\\\"You believe far too much what James says,\\\" said she. \\\"You don't know, him in the least, Mr. Munro. You don't look at a thing from his point, of view, and you will never understand him until you do. It is not, of, course, that he means to say anything that is untrue; but his fancy is, excited, and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea, whether, it tells against himself or not. It hurts me, Mr. Munro, to see the, only man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship\\n\\nYou see by the address of this letter that I still hold my ground, but, between ourselves it has been a terrible fight, and there have been, times when that last plank of which old Whitehall wrote seemed to be, slipping out of my clutch. I have ebbed and flowed, sometimes with a, little money, sometimes without. At my best I was living hard, at my, worst I was very close upon starvation. I have lived for a whole day, upon the crust of a loaf, when I had ten pounds in silver in the drawer, of my table. But those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped, together for my quarter's rent, and I would have tried twenty-four hours, with a tight leather belt before I would have broken in upon it. For two, days I could not raise a stamp to send a letter. I have smiled when I, have read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in Egypt., Their broken victuals would have been a banquet to me. However, what, odds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen, as long as you DO, get it? The garrison of Oakley Villa has passed the worst, and there is, no talk of surrender.\\n\\nbeginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer, than friendship. You squeeze the slender arm which is passed through, yours, you venture to take the little gloved hand, you say good night, at absurd length in the shadow of the door. It is innocent and very, interesting, love trying his wings in a first little flutter. He will, keep his sustained flight later on, the better for the practice. There, was never any question of engagements between us, nor any suggestion of, harm. She knew that I was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects\\n\\n\\\"Because I know better. My boy, I'm a doctor's son, and I've seen too, much of it. I was born inside the machine, and I've seen all the wires., All this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of, the older men. It's to hold the young men back, and to stop the holes by, which they might slip through to the front. I've heard my father say so, a score of times. He had the largest practice in Scotland, and yet he, was absolutely devoid of brains. He slipped into it through seniority, and decorum. No pushing, but take your turn. Very well, laddie, when, you're at the top of the line, but how about it when you've just taken, your place at the tail? When I'm on the top rung I shall look down and, say, 'Now, you youngsters, we are going to have very strict etiquette\\n\\nand I had always defended him; but I was forced now to confess that she, had been right from the beginning. I said enough to show him that I, saw through his whole plot; and I wound up by assuring him that if he, thought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake; for I had, every reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the, very opening which I had most desired myself.\\n\\nand now I find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen;, so I am moving in the right direction. Of course, it compares absurdly, enough with Cullingworth's twenty pound a day, and my little quiet, back-water seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for, ever through his room. Still, I am quite satisfied, and I have no doubt, at all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first, year will be amply justified. It would be a pleasant thing to think that, if anything were really to happen at home, I should be able to be of, some use to them. If things go on as they have begun, I shall soon have, my feet firmly planted.\\n\\nThen I proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of, exploration. There were two upon the ground floor, sixteen feet square, each, and I saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair, condition. The front one would make a consulting room, the other a, waiting room, though I did not care to reflect who was most likely to do, the waiting. I was in the highest spirits, and did a step dance in each, room as an official inauguration.\\n\\nYou'll find my physiology even worse than my theology, Bertie. I have, a way of telling stories backwards to you, which is natural enough when, you consider that I always sit down to write under the influence of the, last impressions which have come upon me. All this talk about the soul, and the brain arises simply from the fact that I have been spending the, last few weeks with a lunatic. And how it came about I will tell you as, clearly as I can.\\n\\nNow, you will think me rather prolix about this man; but, as it looks, as if his life might become entwined with mine, it is a subject of, immediate interest to me, and I am writing all this for the purpose, of reviving my own half-faded impressions, as well as in the hope of, amusing and interesting you. So I must just give you one or two other, points which may make his character more clear to you.\\n\\nI had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases. One, (which was of immense importance to me) was that of a grocer named, Haywood, who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop. I was, passing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid. You may believe, that I saw my chance, bustled in, treated the man, conciliated the wife\\n\\nand he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast. The cooking, was to be done at a neighbouring confectioner's. The landlady's son, was coming in to wait. I was sorry to see that Whitehall was already, slurring his words together, and had evidently been priming himself, heavily. He looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time, we should have. So-and-so could talk well, and the other man could sing, a song. He was so far gone by now, that I ventured (in the capacity of, medical adviser) to speak to him about it.\\n\\nI was to go back to my father's that day, but I had a couple of hours, with Cullingworth in his consulting room before I left. He was in his, best form, and full of a hundred fantastic schemes, by which I was to, help him. His great object was to get his name into the newspapers. That, was the basis of all success, according to his views. It seemed to, me that he was confounding cause with effect; but I did not argue the, point. I laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions, which poured from him. I was to lie senseless in the roadway, and to be, carried into him by a sympathising crowd, while the footman ran with a, paragraph to the newspapers. But there was the likelihood that the, crowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite. In various, disguises I was to feign fits at his very door, and so furnish fresh, copy for the local press. Then I was to die--absolutely to expire--and, all Scotland was to resound with how Dr. Cullingworth, of Avonmouth, had, resuscitated me. His ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of, the idea, and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his, thoughts by the flood of half-serious devices.\\n\\nI daresay you've quite come to the conclusion by this time that, Cullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study--a man in the, first stage of lunacy or general paralysis. You might not be so sure, about it if you were in close contact with him. He justifies his wildest, flights by what he does. It sounds grotesque when put down in black and, white; but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he, had said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth. Now we, see that he has done it. His possibilities are immense. He has such, huge energy at the back of his fertility of invention. I am afraid, on, thinking over all that I have written to you, that I may have given you, a false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents, in which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character, and, omitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a, chance. His conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is, full of pith and idea. \\\"The greatest monument ever erected to Napoleon, Buonaparte was the British National debt,\\\" said he yesterday. Again\\n\\nthen, is he? He does not lie in the features which are to express his, emotions, nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the, blind and deaf. Nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over, which nature hangs her veil of flesh. In none of these things lies the, essence of the man. And now what is left? An arched whitish putty-like, mass, some fifty odd ounces in weight, with a number of white filaments, hanging down from it, looking not unlike the medusae which float in our, summer seas. But these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force, to muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes. They may, themselves therefore be disregarded. Nor can we stop here in our, elimination. This central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on, all sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul. Suicides, have shot away the front lobes of the brain, and have lived to repent, it. Surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections. Much of it, is merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion, and much, for the reception of impressions. All this may be put aside as we search, for the physical seat of what we call the soul--the spiritual part of, the man. And what is left then? A little blob of matter, a handful of, nervous dough, a few ounces of tissue, but there--somewhere there--lurks, that impalpable seed, to which the rest of our frame is but the pod. The, old philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right\\n\\nThen, there is her family pride. That is a very vital portion of the, mother. You know how little I think of such things. If the Esquire were, to be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name I should be, the lighter for it. But, ma foi!--to use her own favourite expletive--it, would not do to say this to her. On the Packenham side (she is a, Packenham) the family can boast of some fairly good men--I mean on the, direct line--but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch, upon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree. Not once, nor, twice, but thrice did the Plantagenets intermarry with us, the Dukes, of Brittany courted our alliance, and the Percies of Northumberland, intertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record. So in my, boyhood she would expound the matter, with hearthbrush in one hand and, a glove full of cinders in the other, while I would sit swinging my, knickerbockered legs, swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as, tight as a sausage skin, as I contemplated the gulf which separated me, from all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables. To this, day if I chance to do anything of which she strongly approves, the dear, heart can say no more than that I am a thorough Packenham; while if I, fall away from the straight path, she says with a sigh that there are, points in which I take after the Munros.\\n\\nBut, my goodness, where have I got to? All this comes from the, Birchespool lamp-posts and curb-stones. And I sat down to write such a, practical letter too! However, I give you leave to be as dogmatic and, didactic as you like in return. Cullingworth says my head is like a, bursting capsule, with all the seeds getting loose. Poor seed, too, I, fear, but some of it may lodge somewhere--or not, as Fate pleases.\\n\\ntherefore, and conveyed him to his home, I sitting with my most, professional air, and he standing straight up between my hands. The, carriage went at a walk, and the crowd trailed behind, with all the folk, looking out of the windows, so that a more glorious advertisement could, not be conceived. It looked like the advance guard of a circus. Once at, his house, however, professional etiquette demanded that I should hand, the case over to the family attendant, which I did with as good a grace, as possible--not without some lingering hope that the old established, practitioner might say, \\\"You have taken such very good care of my, patient, Dr. Munro, that I should not dream of removing him from your, hands.\\\" On the contrary, he snatched it away from me with avidity, and I, retired with some credit, an excellent advertisement, and a guinea.\\n\\nFor the next three days I had not a single ring at the bell of any sort, whatever. A man could not be more isolated from his kind. It used to, amuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passers-by stopped to, look at my plate. Once (on a Sunday morning) there were over a hundred, in an hour, and often I could see from their glancing over their, shoulders as they walked on, that they were thinking or talking of the, new doctor.\\n\\nMedical men, according to his view, have been afraid of producing a, poisonous effect with their drugs. With him, on the contrary, the, whole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning, and when the case, is serious, his remedies are heroic. Where, in epilepsy, I should have, given thirty-grain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours, he, would give two drachms every three. No doubt it will seem to you very, kill-or-cure, and I am myself afraid that a succession of coroners', inquests may check Cullingworth's career; but hitherto he has had no, public scandal, while the cases which he has brought back to life have, been numerous. He is the most fearless fellow. I have seen him pour, opium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled. But either his, knowledge or his luck always brings him out right.\\n\\nOne curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me., She is a stately looking widow, Turner by name, the most depressingly, respectable figure, as of Mrs. Grundy's older and less frivolous sister., She lives in a tiny house, with one small servant to scale. Well, every, two months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink, which lasts for, about a week. It ends as abruptly as it begins, but while it is on the, neighbours know it. She shrieks, yells, sings, chivies the servant\\n\\nBut in all soberness, I really do think, Bertie, that very much which, seems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it, properly. I tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink, and immorality. But physically, I fancy that it applies more obviously, than it does morally. All the physical evils of life seem to culminate, in death; and yet death, as I have seen it, has not been a painful or, terrible process. In many cases, a man dies without having incurred, nearly as much pain, during the whole of his fatal illness, as would, have arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw. And it is often, those deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker, which are least, so to the sufferer. When a man is overtaken by an express and shivered, into fragments, or when he drops from a fourth-floor window and, is smashed into a bag of splinters, the unfortunate spectators are, convulsed with horror, and find a text for pessimistic views about the, Providence which allows such things to be. And yet, it is very doubtful, whether the deceased, could his tongue be loosened, would remember, anything at all about the matter. We know, as students of medicine\\n\\nI said that the patients were very homely. Any one who is over-starched, might well come here to be unstiffened. I confess that I did not quite, fall in with it at once. When on one of my first mornings a club patient, with his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if I were the, doctor's man, I sent him on to see the groom in the stable. But soon one, falls into the humour of it. There is no offence meant; and why should, any be taken? They are kindly, generous folk; and if they pay no respect, to your profession in the abstract, and so rather hurt your dignity\\n\\n'There's two of 'em here. It's Dr. Cullingworth we want to see, but if, we go in we'll be shown as likely as not to Dr. Munro.' So it ends in, some cases in their not coming at all. Then there are the women. Women, don't care a toss whether you are a Solomon, or whether you are hot from, an asylum. It's all personal with them. You fetch them, or you don't, fetch them. I know how to work them, but they won't come if they think, they are going to be turned over to anybody else. That's what I put the, falling away down to.\\\"\\n\\nand man's form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine, we, walked amid the pealings of the \\\"Wedding March\\\" into the vestry, where, my dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the, register in the wrong place, so that to all appearance it was she who, had just married the clergyman. And then amid congratulations and kindly, faces, we were together, her hand on my forearm, upon the steps of the, church, and saw the familiar road stretching before us. But it was, not that road which lay before my eyes, but rather the path of our, lives;--that broader path on which our feet were now planted, so, pleasant to tread, and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist. Was, it long, or was it short? Was it uphill, or was it down? For her, at, least, it should be smooth, if a man's love could make it so.\\n\\n\\\"When the maid was arranging your room after your departure, she cleared, some pieces of torn paper from under the grate. Seeing my name upon, them, she brought them, as in duty bound, to her mistress, who pasted, them together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to, you, in which I am referred to in the vilest terms, such as 'a bankrupt, swindler' and 'the unscrupulous Cullingworth.' I can only say that we, are astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence, while you were a guest under our roof, and we refuse to have anything, more to do with you in any shape or form.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly, qualified medical men. The Cullingworths vanished away, and I never, heard any more of them, for he was a man who prided himself upon never, writing a letter. His father had formerly a very large and lucrative, practice in the West of Scotland, but he died some years ago. I had a, vague idea, founded upon some chance remark of his, that Cullingworth, had gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good, stead there. As for me I began, as you will remember that I explained, in my last, by acting as assistant in my father's practice. You know\\n\\nIt is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the, views of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive, and will wait, resignedly for what fate may send him. The objector forgets that among, the other things fated is that we of northern blood SHOULD strive and, should NOT sit down with folded hands. But when a man has striven, when, he has done all he knows, and when, in spite of it, a thing comes to, pass, let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune. It, is part of the main line of his destiny then, and is working to an end., A man loses his fortune; he gains earnestness. His eyesight goes; it, leads him to a spirituality. The girl loses her beauty; she becomes more, sympathetic. We think we are pushing our own way bravely, but there is a, great Hand in ours all the time.\\n\\nThe man who claims that we can know nothing is, to my mind, as, unreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely, revealed to us. I know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type, of scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know, but has not, imagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of, doubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance., He is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws\\n\\nLook at it in this way. We know that many of the permanent facts of the, universe are NOT chance. It is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing, clear of each other, that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which, will drift it to a congenial soil, that the creature is adapted to its, environment. Show me a whale with its great-coat of fat, and I want no, further proof of design. But logically, as it seems to me, ALL must be, design, or all must be chance. I do not see how one can slash a line, right across the universe, and say that all to the right of that is, chance, and all to the left is pre-ordained. You would then have to, contend that things which on the face of them are of the same class, are, really divided by an impassable gulf, and that the lower are regulated\\n\\nI tell you these trivial matters, my dear Bertie, just to show you that, I am not down on my luck, and that my life is not pitched in the minor, key altogether, in spite of my queer situation. But, to turn to graver, things: I was right glad to get your letter, and to read all your, denunciations about dogmatic science. Don't imagine that my withers are, wrung by what you say, for I agree with almost every word of it.\\n\\nThe moment I looked him in the face I smelled mischief. He had a gleam, of settled malice in his eye. I believe it was my refusal to back his, paper which was running in his head. Anyway he looked as dangerous as he, could look, with his scowling face sunk forward a little, his hands, down near his hips (for his boxing, like everything else about him, is, unconventional), and his jaw set like a rat-trap.\\n\\nVery sober to outward seeming, but in a frenzy within, he went down to, the station one night, and, stooping to the pigeon-hole, he asked the, ticket-clerk, in the suavest voice, whether he could tell him how far, it was to London. The official put forward his face to reply when, Cullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a, piston. The clerk flew backwards off his stool, and his yell of pain and, indignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance., They pursued Cullingworth; but he, as active and as fit as a greyhound\\n\\nSo there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices, and wonderful introductions! I believe the only person in the whole, house who regretted me was Jimmy, who was quite downcast at the news., His grief, however, did not prevent him from brushing my new top-hat, the wrong way on the morning that I left. I did not notice it until I, reached the station, and a most undignified object I must have looked, when I took my departure.\\n\\nI ask myself, where is the man, the very, very inmost essence of the, man? See how much you may subtract from him without touching it. It does, not lie in the limbs which serve him as tools, nor in the apparatus by, which he is to digest, nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen. All, these are mere accessories, the slaves of the lord within. Where\\n\\ncataracts, iritis, refractions, what you like; here's the great Signor, Cullingworth, right up to date and ready for anything!' In they come of, course, droves of them, and then I arrive and take the money. Here's, my luggage!\\\" he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room., \\\"Those are glasses, my boy, concave and convex, hundreds of them. I test, an eye, fit him on the spot, and send him away shouting. Then I load, up a steamer and come home, unless I elect to buy one of their little, States and run it.\\\"\\n\\nYou will wonder, perhaps, how we get on--my wife and I--in the matter, of religion. Well, we both go our own ways. Why should I proselytise? I, would not for the sake of abstract truth take away her child-like faith, which serves to make life easier and brighter to her. I have made myself, ill-understood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in, them any bitterness against the orthodox creeds. Far from saying that, they are all false, it would express my position better to say that they, are all true. Providence would not have used them were they not the best, available tools, and in that sense divine. That they are final I deny. A, simpler and more universal creed will take their place, when the mind of, man is ready for it; and I believe it will be a creed founded upon those, lines of absolute and provable truth which I have indicated. But the old, creeds are still the best suited to certain minds, and to certain ages., If they are good enough for Providence to use, they are good enough for, us to endure. We have but to wait upon the survival of the truest. If I, have seemed to say anything aggressive against them, it was directed, at those who wish to limit the Almighty's favour to their own little, clique, or who wish to build a Chinese wall round religion, with no, assimilation of fresh truths, and no hope of expansion in the future. It, is with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce. As for my, wife, I would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers, as, she would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table., She is not narrow in her views; but if one could stand upon the very, topmost pinnacle of broad-mindedness, one would doubtless see from it, that even the narrow have their mission.\\n\\nonly I may have been a little more emphatic. \\\"Pain in the jaw,\\\" said he., \\\"You needn't make such a noise,\\\" said I; \\\"other people are ill besides, you.\\\" \\\"If I pay my money, young man, I'll make such noise as I like.\\\", And actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door., He would have gone on with his devil's tattoo all morning if I had not, led him down the path and seen him off the premises. An hour afterwards, Horton whirled into the surgery, with a trail of banged doors behind, him. \\\"What's this about Mr. Usher, Munro?\\\" he asked. \\\"He says that you, were violent towards him.\\\" \\\"There was a club patient here who kept on, banging the knocker,\\\" said I; \\\"I was afraid that he would disturb Mrs., White, and so I made him stop.\\\" Horton's eyes began to twinkle. \\\"My, boy,\\\" said he, \\\"that club patient, as you call him, is the richest man, in Merton, and worth a hundred a year to me.\\\" I have no doubt that he, appeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation; but I have not, heard anything of the matter since.\\n\\nthat there was no getting away from him. He was on me once more with, a regular football rush that knocked me off my balance. Before I knew, where I was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear. I, tripped over a footstool, and then before I could get my balance he had, me on the same ear again, and my head was singing like a tea-kettle., He was as pleased as possible with himself, blowing out his chest and, slapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the, room.\\n\\n\\\"By God, Dr. Munro, sir, I'm the man that's going to stick to you. I'm, only an old sailor-man, sir, with perhaps more liquor than sense; but, I'm the Queen's servant, and touch my pension every quarter day. I, don't claim to be R. N., but I'm not merchant service either. Here I, am, rotting in lodgings, but by ----, Dr. Munro, sir, I carried seven, thousand stinking Turks from Varna to Balaclava Bay. I'm with you, Dr., Munro, and we put this thing through together.\\\"\\n\\nwhen only a senior midshipman, lost the sight of one eye and the use of, one arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable Pah in, the Maori war. The other was a sad-faced poetical-looking man, of, good birth as I understood, who had been disowned by his family on the, occasion of his eloping with the cook. His name was Carr, and his chief, peculiarity, that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could, always tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in., He would cock his head, think over his own symptoms, and then give, you the hour fairly correctly. An unusual drink would disarrange him\\n\\nI led off, and then in he came hitting with both hands, and grunting, like a pig at every blow. From what I could see of him he was no boxer, at all, but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter. I was guarding, with both hands for half a minute, and then was rushed clean off my legs, and banged up against the door, with my head nearly through one of the, panels. He wouldn't stop then, though he saw that I had no space to get, my elbows back; and he let fly a right-hander which would have put me, into the hall, if I hadn't slipped it and got back to the middle of the, room.\\n\\nFred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time. I, gave him his usual dose last thing at night; and then, as he seemed to, be sleeping peacefully, I went to my own room for the rest which I badly, needed. I did not wake until eight in the morning, when I was roused, by the jingling of a spoon in a saucer, and the step of Miss Williams, passing my door. She was taking him the arrowroot which I had ordered, over-night. I heard her open the door, and the next moment my heart, sprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream, and her cup and saucer, crashed upon the floor. An instant later she had burst into my room\\n\\nand all these bodies for? Eh, laddie? For encouraging the best interests, of the profession. Do you suppose they do that by making the, population healthy? It's about time we had a mutiny among the general, practitioners. If I had the use of half the funds which the Association, has, I should spend part of them in drain-blocking, and the rest in the, cultivation of disease germs, and the contamination of drinking water.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we came down to the dining-room for supper, Mrs. Cullingworth was, waiting there to greet me. I was sorry to see that she was pale and, weary-looking. However, we had a merry meal in the old style, and her, husband's animation reflected itself upon her face, until at last we, might have been back in the little room, where the Medical Journals, served as a chair, instead of in the great oak-furnished, picture-hung, chamber to which we had been promoted. All the time, however, not one, word as to the object of my journey.\\n\\nWhen I came back I settled down once more to the routine of my father's, practice, holding on there until something may turn up. And for six, months I have had to wait; a weary six months they have been. You see I, cannot ask my father for money--or, at least, I cannot bring myself to, take an unnecessary penny of his money--for I know how hard a fight, it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest, little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose, is to a tailor. Foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of, guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury! We can just hold, on, and I would not have him a pound the poorer for me. But you can, understand, Bertie, that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have, to go about without any money in my pocket. It affects me in so many, petty ways. A poor man may do me a kindness, and I have to seem mean in, his eyes. I may want a flower for a girl, and must be content to appear, ungallant. I don't know why I should be ashamed of this, since it is no, fault of mine, and I hope that I don't show it to any one else that I AM, ashamed of it; but to you, my dear Bertie, I don't mind confessing that, it hurts my self-respect terribly.\\n\\nAfter this bit of bravado I felt better, and I thought over the, situation. I was alone in a strange town, without connections, without, introductions, with less than a pound in my pocket, and with no, possibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities. I had no one at, all to look to for help, for all my recent letters from home had given a, dreary account of the state of things there. My poor father's health and, his income were dwindling together. On the other hand, I reflected that, there were some points in my favour. I was young. I was energetic. I had, been brought up hard, and was quite prepared to rough it. I was well up, in my work, and believed I could get on with patients. My house was an, excellent one for my purpose, and I had already put the essentials of, furniture into it. The game was not played out yet. I jumped to my feet, and clenched my hand, and swore to the chandelier that it never should, be played out until I had to beckon for help from the window.\\n\\nRound he came, and very helpful he was. He seemed to know all about the, procedure--\\\"Buried two wives, Dr. Munro, sir!\\\" I signed the certificate, myself, conveyed it to the registrar, got the order for burial, took, it round to the parish clerk, arranged an hour, then off to the, undertaker's, and back to my practice. It was a kind of nightmare, morning to look back upon, relieved only by the figure of my old, Bohemian, with his pea jacket, his black thorn, his puffy, crinkly face\\n\\nthat he should not say one word about his phenomenal success here--of, which I am naturally most anxious to hear--not a word either upon the, important subject of our partnership, but will think and talk of nothing, but this extraordinary naval idea. In a week he will have tossed it, aside in all probability, and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the, Jews and settling them in Madagascar. Yet from all he has said, and all, I have seen, there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way, made a tremendous hit, and to-morrow I shall let you know all about, it. Come what may, I am delighted that I came, for things promise to be, interesting. Regard this not as the end of a letter, but of a paragraph., You shall have the conclusion to-morrow, or on Thursday at the latest., Goodbye, and my remembrance to Lawrence if you see him. How's your, friend from Yale?\\n\\nOne day we went to the Central Hotel billiard-room in the evening to, play a match. Our form is just about the same, and we should have bad an, enjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his. He had, been in a sullen humour the whole day, pretending not to hear what, I said to him, or else giving snappy answers, and looking like a, thunder-cloud. I was determined not to have a row, so I took no notice, at all of his continual provocations, which, instead of pacifying him\\n\\nI think that I mentioned, when I gave you a short sketch of my dear old, mother, that she has a very high standard of family honour. She really, tries to live up to the Percy-Plantagenet blend which is said to flow, in our veins; and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her, from sailing through life, like the grande dame that she is, throwing, largesse to right and left, with her head in the air and her soul in the, clouds. I have often heard her say (and I am quite convinced that she, meant it) that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves, than know that we had committed a dishonourable action. Yes; for all her, softness and femininity, she could freeze iron-hard at the suspicion of, baseness; and I have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace, collar when she has heard of an act of meanness.\\n\\nThere was no need of three insertions. One would have been ample. Within, half an hour of the appearance of the first edition, I had an applicant, at the end of my bell-wire, and for the remainder of the evening Paul, was ushering them in and I interviewing them with hardly a break. I, should have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat;, but as we saw the demand increase, our conditions went up and up;, white aprons, proper dress for answering door, doing beds and boots\\n\\nHowever, I had not quite got to the end of Whitehall's visit yet. When, I went back I took down the beautiful lava jug, and inside I found his, card. On the back was written, \\\"You have gone into action, sir. It may, be your fate to sink or to swim, but it can never be your degradation, to strike. Die on the last plank and be damned to you, or come into port, with your ensign flying mast-high.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you this, Bertie, because if I put reason above emotion I would, not have you think that I am not open to attacks of the latter also., I feel that what I say about religion is too cold and academic. I feel, that there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting., But if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a, thing to be true, which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out, against, then you are selling your opiates too high. I'm a volunteer for, \\\"God's own forlorn hope,\\\" and I'll clamber up the breech as long as I, think I can see the flag of truth waving in front of me.\\n\\nthe man whom they were after, running at the top of his speed in their, direction. His little peculiarity had asserted itself, you see, and, he had unconsciously turned in his flight. They tripped him up, flung, themselves upon him, and after a long and desperate struggle dragged, him to the police station. He was charged before the magistrate next, morning, but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own, defence that he carried the Court with him, and escaped with a nominal, fine. At his invitation, the witnesses and the police trooped after, him to the nearest hotel, and the affair ended in universal, whisky-and-sodas.\\n\\na sitting-room, and a fourth room, which Cullingworth insisted upon, regarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease, though, I am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from, below which had given him the idea. At any rate, with his usual energy, he had not only locked the room up, but had gummed varnished paper over, all the cracks of the door, to prevent the imaginary contagion from, spreading. The furniture was the sparest possible. There were, I, remember, only two chairs in the sitting-room; so that when a guest came, (and I think I was the only one) Cullingworth used to squat upon a pile, of yearly volumes of the British Medical Journal in the corner. I can, see him now levering himself up from his lowly seat, and striding about, the room roaring and striking with his hands, while his little wife, sat mum in the corner, listening to him with love and admiration in her, eyes. What did we care, any one of the three of us, where we sat or how, we lived, when youth throbbed hot in our veins, and our souls were all, aflame with the possibilities of life? I still look upon those Bohemian, evenings, in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese, as being among, the happiest that I have known.\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to have any doctoring it must come from you, laddie,\\\" he said;, \\\"for if I was to turn my toes up in the public square, there's not a man, here who would do more than sign my certificate. By Crums, they might, get the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me, for, there's no love lost between us. But I want to go down to the practice, all the same.\\\"\\n\\nYou see, it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first, appearance in Birchespool was not in the dock of the police-court. I, should have had no one to answer for me, if I had been arrested, and, should have been put quite on a level with my adversary. I daresay you, think I made a great fool of myself, but I should like to know how, I could have acted otherwise. The only thing that I feel now is my, loneliness. What a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child!\\n\\nI was a frequent visitor to the Cullingworths, for the pleasure that I, got was made the sweeter by the pleasure which I hoped that I gave. They, knew no one, and desired to know no one; so that socially I seemed to be, the only link that bound them to the world. I even ventured to interfere, in the details of their little menage. Cullingworth had a fad at the, time, that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment, of the open-air life of our ancestors, and as a corollary he kept his, windows open day and night. As his wife was obviously fragile, and yet, would have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint, I, took it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she, suffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a, draught. He scowled savagely at me for my interference; and I thought, we were on the verge of a quarrel, but it blew over, and he became more, considerate in the matter of ventilation.\\n\\n, You write reproachfully, my dear Bertie, and you say that absence must, have weakened our close friendship, since I have not sent you a line, during this long seven months. The real truth of the matter is that, I had not the heart to write to you until I could tell you something, cheery; and something cheery has been terribly long in coming. At, present I can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at, the edges.\\n\\ntogether with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among, the ancient Londoners. Several examples of these metallic cylinders, or tubings were on exhibition in the hall, and were passed round for, inspection among the audience. The learned lecturer prefaced his remarks, by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which, separated them from the days when London was a flourishing city, it, behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might, come as to the habits of the inhabitants. Recent research appeared to, have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall, of London was somewhat later than that of the erection of the Egyptian, Pyramids. A large building had recently been unearthed near the dried-up, bed of the river Thames; and there could be no question from existing, records that this was the seat of the law-making council among the, ancient Britons--or Anglicans, as they were sometimes called. The, lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the Thames had been, tunnelled under by a monarch named Brunel, who is supposed by some, authorities to have succeeded Alfred the Great. The open spaces of, London, he went on to remark, must have been far from safe, as the, bones of lions, tigers, and other extinct forms of carnivora had, been discovered in the Regent's Park. Having briefly referred to the, mysterious structures known as 'pillar-boxes,' which are scattered, thickly over the city, and which are either religious in their origin\\n\\nAfter all, I see more and more clearly that both men and women are, incomplete, fragmentary, mutilated creatures, as long as they are, single. Do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is, the happiest, they are still full of vague unrests, of dim, ill-defined, dissatisfactions, of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts., Alone each is a half-made being, with every instinct and feeling, yearning for its missing moiety. Together they form a complete and, symmetrical whole, the minds of each strongest where that of the other, needs reinforcing. I often think that if our souls survive death (and I, believe they do, though I base my believe on very different grounds from, yours), every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined, with it, to round it off and give it symmetry. So thought the old, Mormon, you remember, who used it as an argument for his creed. \\\"You, cannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you,\\\" he said., \\\"But with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the, world to come.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that I must, tell you of it. Cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel, darts. With this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet, the, length of the back room. We were shooting at a mark after dinner, when, he asked me whether I would hold a halfpenny between my finger and, thumb, and allow him to shoot it out. A halfpenny not being forthcoming\\n\\nits dogmatism about what seems to be false, its conflict with what we, know to be true. We KNOW that man has ascended, not descended; so what, is the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition, of his fall? We KNOW that the world was not made in six days, that the, sun could never be stopped since it was never moving, and that no man, ever lived three days in a fish; so what becomes of the inspiration of a, book which contains such statements? \\\"Truth, though it crush me!\\\"\\n\\nThe room was a large bare one, at the end of a long corridor. Near the, door was seated a footman, placed there to fill up the gap between two, doctors, and looking considerably relieved at my advent. Over by the, window (which was furnished with a wooden guard, like that of a nursery), sat a tall, yellow-haired, yellow-bearded, young man, who raised a pair, of startled blue eyes as we entered. He was turning over the pages of a, bound copy of the Illustrated London News.\\n\\nI had enough to make a man serious before, when I had to face the world, without money or interest. But now to think of the mother and my sisters, and little Paul all leaning upon me when I cannot stand myself--it is, a nightmare. Could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have, those whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it?, But perhaps it won't come to that. Perhaps my father may hold his, own for years. Come what may, I am bound to think that all things are, ordered for the best; though when the good is a furlong off, and we with, our beetle eyes can only see three inches, it takes some confidence in, general principles to pull us through.\\n\\n\\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo Player,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle,\\\" for five shillings;, a tiny fender, half-a-crown; a toilet set, five shillings; another, very small square-topped table, three and sixpence. Whenever I bid, for anything, Whitehall thrust his black-thorn up into the air, and, presently I found him doing so on my behalf when I had no intention of, buying. I narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a, stuffed macaw in a glass case.\\n\\nIt was about four in the afternoon when I reached Birchespool, which, is fifty-three miles by rail from Bradfield. It may be merely a name to, you, and, indeed, until I set foot in it I knew nothing of it myself;, but I can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and, thirty thousand souls (about the same as Bradfield), that it is mildly, manufacturing, that it is within an hour's journey of the sea, that it, has an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well, and that the, country round is exceedingly beautiful. It is small enough to have a, character of its own, and large enough for solitude, which is always the, great charm of a city, after the offensive publicity of the country.\\n\\nThis was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd. The folk, behind, wishing to see all that was going on, pushed against those in, front, until half-a-dozen of the foremost (with, I think, a woman among, them) were flung right up against us. One of these, a rough, sailor-like, fellow in a jersey, got wedged between us; and my antagonist, in his, blind rage, got one of his swinging blows home upon this new-comer's, ear. \\\"What, you----!\\\" yelled the sailor; and in an instant he had taken, over the whole contract, and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty., I grabbed my stick, which had fallen among the crowd, and backed my way, out, rather dishevelled, but very glad to get off so cheaply. From the, shouting which I could hear some time after I reached the door of my, lodgings, I gathered that a good battle was still raging.\\n\\nwe won't leave a doctor in it. It's all they can do now to get butter, to their bread; and when we get to work together they'll have to eat it, dry. Listen to me, my boy! There are a hundred and twenty thousand folk, in this town, all shrieking for advice, and there isn't a doctor who, knows a rhubarb pill from a calculus. Man, we only have to gather them, in. I stand and take the money until my arm aches.\\\"\\n\\nWell, when I had finished my empty-house-and-doctor chart, I found that, there was one villa to let, which undoubtedly was far the most suitable, for my purpose. In the first place it was fairly cheap-forty pounds, or, fifty with taxes. The front looked well. It had no garden. It stood with, the well-to-do quarter upon the one side, and the poorer upon the other., Finally, it was almost at the intersection of four roads, one of which, was a main artery of the town. Altogether, if I had ordered a house for, my purpose I could hardly have got anything better, and I was thrilled, with apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent. I, hurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather, startled the demure clerk inside.\\n\\nMy father took the news philosophically enough, with some rather, sardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep, each other company. But to my mother it was a flash of joy, followed by, a thunderclap of consternation. I had only three under-shirts, the, best of my linen had gone to Belfast to be refronted and recuffed, the, night-gowns were not marked yet--there were a dozen of those domestic, difficulties of which the mere male never thinks. A dreadful vision of, Lady Saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of, my socks obsessed my mother. Out we trudged together, and before evening, her soul was at rest, and I had mortgaged in advance my first month's, salary. She was great, as we walked home, upon the grand people into, whose service I was to enter. \\\"As a matter of fact, my dear,\\\" said she\\n\\nWe used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors; and, there we made a curious quartette: Jimmy (as he wished me to call him), glum and silent; I with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him;, Lady Saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins; and the, good-natured peer, fussy and genial, but always rather subdued in the, presence of his wife. She looked as if a glass of good wine would do, her good, and he as if he would be the better for abstinence; and so, in, accordance with the usual lopsidedness of life, he drank freely, and, she took nothing but lime-juice and water. You cannot imagine a more, ignorant, intolerant, narrow-minded woman than she. If she had only been, content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers, it would, not have mattered; but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating, clacking. What was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease, from one generation to another? She was bounded by insanity upon the, north and upon the south. I resolutely set myself to avoid all argument, with her; but she knew, with her woman's instinct, that we were as far, apart as the poles, and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before, me. One day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an, Episcopal church performing any service in a Presbyterian chapel. Some, neighbouring minister had done it, it seems; and if he had been marked, down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing., I suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue, for she, suddenly turned upon me with:\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, holding out a twitching hand., \\\"I compliment you, sir! You look fresh, ---- fresh, and me with a head, like a toy-shop. We had a pleasant, quiet evening, and I took nothing to, hurt, but it is the ---- relaxing air of this place that settles me. I, can't bear up against it. Last year it gave me the horrors, and I expect, it will again. You're off house-hunting, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\nand calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as, to his position. The good people were so touched by the picture that, he drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them, wept, and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their, bills stand over, but even some talk of a collection then and there to, help Cullingworth on his way. He has, I understand, left Avonmouth, but, no one has any idea what has become of him. It is generally supposed, that he has gone to England. He is a strange fellow, but I wish him luck, wherever he goes.\\n\\nI never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life. He used, language of self-reproach which would have been extravagant if he had, shot off one of my limbs. Our positions were absurdly reversed; and it, was he who sat collapsed in a chair, while it was I, with the dart, still in my finger, who leaned over him and laughed the matter off. Mrs., Cullingworth had run for hot water, and presently with a tweezers we, got the intruder out. There was very little pain (more to-day than, yesterday), but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may, look for a star at the end of my right forefinger.\\n\\nAnd then there came another and a more serious accident. This would be, about two months after the beginning, though already I find it hard to, put things in their due order. A lawyer in the town named Dickson was, riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him. I was, eating saveloys in the back room at the time, but I heard the noise and, rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in., They flooded into my house, thronged my hall, dirtied my consulting, room, and even pushed their way into my back room, which they found, elegantly furnished with a portmanteau, a lump of bread, and a cold, sausage.\\n\\nI had plenty of time on my way to Birchespool to reflect upon my, prospects and present situation. My baggage consisted of a large, brassplate, a small leather trunk, and a hat-box. The plate with my name, engraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head. In my box, were a stethoscope, several medical books, a second pair of boots, two, suits of clothes, my linen and my toilet things. With this, and the five, pounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse, I was sallying out, to clear standing-room, and win the right to live from my fellow-men., But at least there was some chance of permanency about this; and if, there was the promise of poverty and hardship, there was also that of, freedom. I should have no Lady Saltire to toss up her chin because I had, my own view of things, no Cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing. I, would be my own--my very own. I capered up and down the carriage at the, thought. After all, I had everything to gain and nothing in the whole, wide world to lose. And I had youth and strength and energy, and the, whole science of medicine packed in between my two ears. I felt as, exultant as though I were going to take over some practice which lay, ready for me.\\n\\nThe Cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return. There was, a singular look upon both their faces which seemed to ME to mean that, they were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me. When I think, of their absolute geniality a few days ago, and their markedly reserved, manner now, I can make no sense out of it. I asked Cullingworth point, blank what it meant, but he only turned it off with a forced laugh, and, some nonsense about my thin skin. I think that I am the last man in the, world to take offence where none is meant; but at any rate I determined, to end the matter by leaving Bradfield at once. It had struck me, during, my journey back from Stockwell, that Birchespool would be a good place;, so on the very next day I started off, taking my luggage with me, and, bidding a final good-bye to Cullingworth and his wife.\\n\\nWe were away for several weeks in the Isle of Man, and then came back, to Oakley Villa, where Miss Williams was awaiting us in a house in which, even my mother could have found no dust, and with a series of cheering, legends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my, absence. There really was a marked increase in my practice; and for the, last six months or so, without being actually busy, I have always had, enough to occupy me. My people are poor, and I have to work hard for a, small fee; but I still study and attend the local hospital, and keep my, knowledge up-to-date, so as to be ready for my opening when it comes., There are times when I chafe that I may not play a part upon some, larger stage than this; but my happiness is complete, and if fate has, no further use for me, I am content now from my heart to live and to die, where I am.\\n\\nTalking about horses, we had no end of a fuss here the other day., Cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a first-class riding, horse; and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him, he, commissioned a horse dealer to get him one. The man told us of a charger, which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of. He, did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was, because he considered it to be dangerous; but, he added, that Captain, Lucas had given L150 for it, and was prepared to sell it at seventy., This excited Cullingworth, and he ordered the creature to be saddled and, brought round. It was a beautiful animal, coal black, with a magnificent, neck and shoulders, but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears, and an, unpleasant way of looking at you. The horse dealer said that our yard, was too small to try the creature in; but Cullingworth clambered up upon, its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the, ears with the bone handle of his whip. Then ensued one of the most, lively ten minutes that I can remember. The beast justified his, reputation; but Cullingworth, although he was no horseman, stuck to him, like a limpet. Backwards, forwards, sideways, on his fore feet, on, his hind feet, with his back curved, with his back sunk, bucking and, kicking, there was nothing the creature did not try. Cullingworth was, sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail--never by, any chance in the saddle--he had lost both stirrups, and his knees were, drawn up and his heels dug into the creature's ribs, while his hands, clawed at mane, saddle, or ears, whichever he saw in front of him. He, kept his whip, however; and whenever the brute eased down, Cullingworth, lammed him once more with the bone handle. His idea, I suppose, was to, break its spirit, but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry, through. The animal bunched his four feet together, ducked down his, head, arched his back like a yawning cat, and gave three convulsive, springs into the air. At the first, Cullingworth's knees were above the, saddle flaps, at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive, grip, at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling, narrowly, missed the coping of the wall, broke with his head the iron bar which, held some wire netting, and toppled back with a thud into the yard. Up, he bounded with the blood streaming down his face, and running into our, half-finished stables he seized a hatchet, and with a bellow of, rage rushed at the horse. I caught him by the coat and put on a, fourteen-stone drag, while the horse dealer (who was as white as a, cheese) ran off with his horse into the street. Cullingworth broke away, from my grip, and cursing incoherently, his face slobbered with blood\\n\\nBut how do I know what is truth, you ask? I don't. But I know, particularly well what isn't. And surely that is something to have, gained. It isn't true that the great central Mind that planned all, things is capable of jealousy or of revenge, or of cruelty or of, injustice. These are human attributes; and the book which ascribes, them to the Infinite must be human also. It isn't true that the laws of, Nature have been capriciously disturbed, that snakes have talked, that, women have been turned to salt, that rods have brought water out of, rocks. You must in honesty confess that if these things were presented, to us when we were, adults for the first time, we should smile at them., It isn't true that the Fountain of all common sense should punish a race, for a venial offence committed by a person long since dead, and then, should add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon, a single innocent scapegoat. Can you not see all the want of justice, and logic, to say nothing of the want of mercy, involved in such a, conception? Can you not see it, Bertie? How can you blind yourself to, it! Take your eyes away from the details for a moment, and look at this, root idea of the predominant Faith. Is the general conception of it, consistent with infinite wisdom and mercy? If not, what becomes of the, dogmas, the sacraments, the whole scheme which is founded upon this, sand-bank? Courage, my friend! At the right moment all will be laid, aside, as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which, has been a good friend to him in his weakness. But his changes won't be, over then. His hobble will become a walk, and his walk a run. There is, no finality--CAN be none since the question concerns the infinite. All, this, which appears too advanced to you to-day, will seem reactionary, and conservative a thousand years hence.\\n\\nWhen I woke in the morning, and looked round at the bare walls and the, basin on the packing case, I hardly knew where I was. Cullingworth came, charging into the room in his dressing gown, however, and roused me, effectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed, and, throwing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow, with a thud. He was in great spirits, and, squatting on the bed, he held, forth about his plans while I dressed.\\n\\nand I spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to, celebrate the occasion. Old Cullingworth has always had a very high, opinion of lunatics for beginners. \\\"Get a lunatic, my boy! Get a, lunatic!\\\" he used to say. Then it was not only the situation, but the, fine connection that it opened up. I seemed to see exactly what would, happen. There would be illness in the family,--Lord Saltire himself, perhaps, or his wife. There would be no time to send for advice. I would, be consulted. I would gain their confidence and become their family, attendant. They would recommend me to their wealthy friends. It was all, as clear as possible. I was debating before I reached home whether it, would be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order, to take the Professorship which might be offered me.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"If you are so anxious to make a business matter, of it, you can arrange it so.\\\" I could not make out, and cannot make out, now, what had happened to freeze them up so; but I supposed that they, had been talking it over, and came to the conclusion that I was settling, down too much upon the old lines, and that they must remind me that I, was under orders to quit. They might have done it with more tact.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the more human traits--'weak' is hardly the word I should have, used. His rebuke of the Sabbatarians, His personal violence to the, hucksters, His outbursts against the Pharisees, His rather unreasoning, petulance against the fig-tree because it bore no fruit at the wrong, season of the year, His very human feeling towards the housewife who, bustled about when He was talking, his gratification that the ointment, should have been used for Him instead of being devoted to the poor\\n\\nI have told you this trivial little scene, Bertie, to show the strange, way in which Cullingworth springs quarrels upon me; suddenly, without, the slightest possible provocation, taking a most offensive tone, and, then when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance, turning, the whole thing to chaff. This has occurred again and again recently;, and, when coupled with the change in Mrs. Cullingworth's demeanour\\n\\nAs to old Cullingworth, he is booming along as merrily as ever. You say, in your last, that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of, the public in so short a time. That is just the point which I have found, it hard to get light upon. He told me that after his first coming he had, not a patient for a month, and that he was so disheartened that he very, nearly made a moonlight exodus. At last, however, a few cases came his, way--and he made such extraordinary cures of them, or else impressed, them so by his eccentricity, that they would do nothing but talk of him., Some of his wonderful results got into the local press, though, after, my Avonmouth experience, I should not like to guarantee that he did not, himself convey them there. He showed me an almanac, which had a great, circulation in the district.\\n\\nBut--there is a great big \\\"but\\\" in the case. You must ride yourself on, the curb the whole time. Unless you are sure--absolutely sure--that you, can do this, you are far best at home. You must never for one instant, forget yourself. You must remember what your object is in being there., You must inspire respect. Be friendly, genial, convivial--what you, will--but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman. If you can make, yourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that, you join a fresh introduction to practice. But beware of drink! Above, everything, beware of drink! The company that you are in may condone, it in each other, but never in the man who wishes them to commit their, lives to his safe keeping. A slip is fatal--a half slip perilous. Make, your rule of life and go by it, in spite of challenge or coaxers. It, will be remembered in your favour next morning.\\n\\nWhen first I came out of the faith in which I had been reared, I, certainly did feel for a time as if my life-belt had burst. I won't, exaggerate and say that I was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual, darkness. Youth is too full of action for that. But I was conscious of a, vague unrest, of a constant want of repose, of an emptiness and hardness, which I had not noticed in life before. I had so identified religion, with the Bible that I could not conceive them apart. When the foundation, proved false, the whole structure came rattling about my ears. And then, good old Carlyle came to the rescue; and partly from him, and partly, from my own broodings, I made a little hut of my own, which has kept me, snug ever since, and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides.\\n\\nfull of every lofty aspiration, and that a gross physical cause, such, as the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on, to the surface of the membrane which covers his brain, may have the, ultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every, bestial attribute! That a man's individuality should swing round, from pole to pole, and yet that one life should contain these two, contradictory personalities--is it not a wondrous thing?\\n\\nSmeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some, one is conspiring to poison him with copper, against which he takes the, most extravagant precautions. It is the strangest sight, he says, to, see Cullingworth at his meals; for he sits with an elaborate chemical, apparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow, with which he, tests samples of every course. I could not help laughing at Smeaton's, description, and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it. Of all, ruins, that of a fine man is the saddest.\\n\\ncooking,--we became more and more exacting. So at last we made our, selection; a Miss Wotton, who asked leave to bring her sister with her., She was a hard-faced brusque-mannered person, whose appearance in a, bachelor's household was not likely to cause a scandal. Her nose was in, itself a certificate of virtue. She was to bring her furniture into, the basement, and I was to give her and her sister one of the two upper, rooms for a bedroom.\\n\\nFrom that I turned to the most important point of all--the arrangement, of my consulting room. My experience with Cullingworth had taught me, one thing at least,--that patients care nothing about your house if they, only think that you can cure them. Once get that idea into their, heads, and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your, prescriptions on the manger. Still, as this was, for many a day to, come, to be the only furnished room in my house, it was worth a little, planning to get it set out to the best advantage.\\n\\n, I am writing this, my dear Bertie, at a little table which has been, fitted up in the window of my bedroom. Every one in the house is asleep, except myself; and all the noise of the city is hushed. Yet my own brain, is singularly active, and I feel that I am better employed in sitting, up and writing to you, than in tossing about upon my bed. I am often, accused of being sleepy in the daytime, but every now and then Nature, gets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night.\\n\\nI was supposed to have my eye upon him all day, with a two-hour interval, every afternoon and an evening to myself upon Fridays. But then what was, the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near, and I had, no friends whom I could visit? I did a fair amount of reading, for Lord, Saltire let me have the run of his library. Gibbon gave me a couple of, enchanting weeks. You know the effect that he produces. You seem to, be serenely floating upon a cloud, and looking down on all these pigmy, armies and navies, with a wise Mentor ever at your side to whisper to, you the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama.\\n\\nas we wonder to-day. I suppose that we DO know a little more than they., We have an arc of about three thousand years given us, from which to, calculate out the course to be described by our descendants; but that, arc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which Providence uses in, working out its designs that our deductions from it must, I think, be, uncertain. Will civilisation be swamped by barbarism? It happened once, before, because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of, darkness. But what, for example, could break down the great country in, which you dwell? No, our civilisation will endure and grow more complex., Man will live in the air and below the water. Preventive medicine will, develop until old age shall become the sole cause of death. Education, and a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime. The, English-speaking races will unite, with their centre in the United, States. Gradually the European States will follow their example. War, will become rare, but more terrible. The forms of religion will be, abandoned, but the essence will be maintained; so that one universal, creed will embrace the whole civilised earth, which will preach trust, in that central power, which will be as unknown then as now. That's my, horoscope, and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking. But, Bertie Swanborough and Stark Munro will be blowing about on the west, wind, and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half, of it has come to pass.\\n\\nI sat in my house all day, with that ever-present sense of privacy and, novelty which had thrilled me when I first shut the street door behind, me. At evening I sallied out and bought a loaf of bread, half a pound, of tea (\\\"sweepings,\\\" they call it, and it cost eightpence), a tin, kettle (fivepence), a pound of sugar, a tin of Swiss milk, and a tin, of American potted meat. I had often heard my mother groan over the, expenses of housekeeping, and now I began to understand what she meant., Two and ninepence went like a flash, but at least I had enough to keep, myself going for some days.\\n\\nwhich has been deepening from day to day. Well, it seemed to reach a, climax this morning, and on our way to the rooms I could hardly get a, word out of him. The place was fairly crowded with patients, but my, own share was rather below the average. When I had finished I added a, chapter to my novel, and waited until he and his wife were ready for the, daily bag-carrying homewards.\\n\\nThat evening, and for many evenings to come, we worked upon our liver., For our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat, in an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the, non-nitrogenous waxy matter. With our limited appliances the only way, we could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying, pan. So night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of, a beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in, making these grim fricassees. Nothing came of all our work; for though, Cullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case, and, wrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject, he was never, apt at stating his views with his pen, and he left, I am sure, a very, confused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was, driving at. Again, as he was a mere student without any letters after, his name, he got scant attention, and I never heard that he gained over, a single supporter.\\n\\nNow and again young Derwent introduced some excitement into my dull, life. On one occasion when we were walking in the grounds, he suddenly, snatched up a spade from a grass-plot, and rushed at an inoffensive, under-gardener. The man ran screaming for his life, with my patient, cursing at his very heels, and me within a few paces of him. When I at, last laid my hand on his collar, he threw down his weapon and burst into, shrieks of laughter. It was only mischief and not ferocity; but when, that under-gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like, a cream cheese. At night the attendant slept in a camp-bed at the foot, of the patient's, and my room was next door, so that I could be called, if necessary. No, it was not a very exhilarating life!\\n\\nand I hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and, theologians: \\\"our gross frames\\\" and \\\"our miserable mortal clay\\\" are, phrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety. It, is no compliment to the Creator to depreciate His handiwork. Whatever, theory or belief we may hold about the soul, there can, I suppose, be, no doubt that the body is immortal. Matter may be transformed (in which, case it may be re-transformed), but it can never be destroyed. If, a comet were to strike this globule of ours, and to knock it into a, billion fragments, which were splashed all over the solar system--if, its fiery breath were to lick up the earth's surface until it was peeled, like an orange, still at the end of a hundred millions of years, every tiniest particle of our bodies would exist--in other forms and, combinations, it is true, but still those very atoms which now form the, forefinger which traces these words. So the child with the same wooden, bricks will build a wall, then strew them on the table; then a tower\\n\\nIt wasn't a pretty sight. A woman, pinched and bedraggled, with a baby, on her arm, was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom I, judged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her. He was, one of those red-faced, dark-eyed men who can look peculiarly malignant, when they choose. It was clear that he was half mad with drink, and that, she had been trying to lure him away from some den. I was just in time, to see him take a flying kick at her, amid cries of \\\"Shame!\\\" from the, crowd, and then lurch forward again, with the evident intention of, having another, the mob still expostulating vaguely.\\n\\nThis pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes., I remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent, London specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row, who, amused himself by interjecting remarks. The lecturer appealed to his, audience at last. \\\"These interruptions are insufferable, gentlemen,\\\", said he; \\\"will no one free me from this annoyance?\\\" \\\"Hold your, tongue--you, sir, on the front bench,\\\" cried Cullingworth, in his, bull's bellow. \\\"Perhaps you'll make me,\\\" said the fellow, turning a, contemptuous face over his shoulder. Cullingworth closed his note-book\\n\\n, He was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity. You, cannot imagine a more savage-looking creature than Cullingworth is when, his temper goes wrong. He gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his, light blue eyes, and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra. He, isn't a beauty at his best, but at his worst he's really phenomenal. At, the first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room.\\n\\n\\\"You will permit me, Dr. Munro, sir, to place this trifle in your room., It's lava, sir; lava from Vesuvius, and made in Naples. By ----, you may, think its empty, Dr. Munro, sir, but it is full of my best wishes; and, when you've got the best practice in this town you may point to that, vase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport, who, backed you from the start.\\\"\\n\\nI had the kindest of leave takings from Horton. If he had been my, brother he could not have been more affectionate. I could not have, thought that I should grow so fond of a man in so short a time. He, takes the keenest interest in my venture, and I am to write him a full, account. He gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had, coloured himself--the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker., It was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at Bradfield, I, had a little harbour at Merton for which I could make. Still, of course\\n\\nmakes a most substantial meal. Butter I have discarded for the present., My actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day, but I am a, patron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day, which I, expend upon an evening paper; for with events hurrying on like this in, Alexandria, I cannot bear to be without the news. Still I often reproach, myself with that halfpenny, for if I went out in the evening and looked, at the placards I might save it, and yet have a general idea of what is, going on. Of course, a halfpenny a night sounds nothing, but think of a, shilling a month! Perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on, this diet! I am thin, it is true, but I never felt more fit in my life., So full of energy am I that I start off sometimes at ten at night and, walk hard until two or three in the morning. I dare not go out during, the day, you see, for fear that I should miss a patient. I have asked my, mother not to send little Paul down yet until I see my way more clearly.\\n\\nThen there are other cures which depend, I think, upon his own personal, magnetism. He is so robust and loud-voiced and hearty that a weak, nervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality. He is so, perfectly confident that he can cure them, that he makes them perfectly, confident that they can be cured; and you know how in nervous cases the, mind reacts upon the body. If he chose to preserve crutches and sticks\\n\\nThere was one other incident, however. One day after I had been in, practice about two months, I observed a bearded commonplace-looking, person lounging about on the other side of the road. In the afternoon he, was again visible from my consulting-room window. When I saw him there, once more next morning, my suspicions were aroused, and they became, certainties when, a day or so afterwards, I came out of a patient's, house in a poor street, and saw the same fellow looking into a, greengrocer's shop upon the other side. I walked to the end of the, street, waited round the corner, and met him as he came hurrying after.\\n\\nHowever, she took it most admirably. They were all three at breakfast, when I came round, the general, Mrs. La Force, and the daughter. Somehow, they seemed to know all that I had to say at the very sight of me; and, in their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me, for the, shock I had suffered, and the disturbance of my household. I found, myself turned from the consoler into the consoled. For an hour or more, we talked it over, I explaining what I hope needed no explanation, that, as the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to, know how immediate was his danger. There can be no doubt that the fall, of temperature and the quietness which both Porter and I had looked upon, as a hopeful sign, were really the beginning to the end.\\n\\nthere's order! And where there is order there must be mind, and where, there is mind there must be sense of Justice. I don't allow that there, can be any doubt as to the existence of that central Mind, or as to the, possession by it of certain attributes. The stars help me to realise, these. It is strange, when one looks upon them, to think that the, Churches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether, the Almighty is most gratified by our emptying a tea-spoonful of water, over our babies' heads, or by our waiting a few years and then plunging, them bodily into a tank. It would be comic if it were not so tragic.\\n\\nimmediately after my breach with Cullingworth. It's rather hard to know, where to begin when one has so many events to narrate, disconnected from, each other, and trivial in themselves, yet which have each loomed large, as I came upon them, though they look small enough now that they are so, far astern. As I have mentioned Cullingworth, I may as well say first, the little that is to be said about him. I answered his letter in the, way which I have, I think, already described. I hardly expected to hear, from him again; but my note had evidently stung him, and I had a, brusque message in which he said that if I wished him to believe in my, \\\"bona-fides\\\" (whatever he may have meant by that), I would return the, money which I had had during the time that I was with him at Bradfield., To this I replied that the sum was about twelve pounds; that I still, retained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds, if I came to Bradfield, that the balance in my favour was two hundred, and eighty-eight pounds; and that unless I had a cheque by return, I, should put the matter into the hands of my solicitor. This put a final, end to our correspondence.\\n\\nWhen the supper was finished, Cullingworth led the way into a small, sitting-room, where we both lit our pipes, and Mrs. Cullingworth her, cigarette. He sat for some little time in silence, and then bounding up, rushed to the door and flung it open. It is always one of his strange, peculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring, against him; for, in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness\\n\\npull up your socks!\\\" I should have been less surprised. And then, suddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind, and I rushed to, the cellar. The cask was tilted forward on the trestles. I struck it and, it boomed like a drum. I turned the tap, and not one drop appeared. Let, us draw a veil over the painful scene. Suffice it that Mrs. Wotton got, her marching orders then and there--and that next day Paul and I found, ourselves alone in the empty house once more.\\n\\nBut in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the, beginning of my stay with him, for my mother's letters stigmatising his, conduct had begun very early. For some time he had been uncertain how, to proceed. Then he had invented the excuse (which seemed to me at the, time, if you remember, to be quite inadequate) about the slight weekly, decline in the practice in order to get me out of it. His next move, was to persuade me to start for myself; and as this would be impossible, without money, he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small, weekly loan. I remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about, ordering furniture and other things, because tradesmen gave long credit, to beginners, and I could always fall back upon him if necessary. He, knew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at, least a year's tenancy. Then he waited to spring his mine until I had, written to say that I had finally committed myself, on which by return, of post came his letter breaking the connection. It was so long and so, elaborate a course of deceit, that I for the first time felt something, like fear as I thought of Cullingworth. It was as though in the, guise and dress of a man I had caught a sudden glimpse of something, sub-human--of something so outside my own range of thought that I was, powerless against it.\\n\\nIt was only when I went to my bedroom that I realised the oversights, which I had made in my furnishing. There was no mattress and no pillow, or bed-clothes. My mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the, practice, that I had never given a thought to my own private wants. I, slept that night upon the irons of my bed, and rose up like St. Lawrence, from the gridiron. My second suit of clothes with Bristowe's \\\"Principles, of Medicine\\\" made an excellent pillow, while on a warm June night a, man can do well wrapped in his overcoat. I had no fancy for second-hand, bed-clothes, and determined until I could buy some new ones, to make, myself a straw pillow, and to put on both my suits of clothes on the, colder nights. Two days later, however, the problem was solved in more, luxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother\\n\\nso that Lady Teazle or Mrs. Sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan, chair without soiling her dainty satin shoes. It brings home to me what, an unstable chemical compound man is. Here are the stage accessories, as good as ever, while the players have all split up into hydrogen, and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, with traces of iron and silica and, phosphorus. A tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water,--there, is the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair! It's a curious double, picture, if one could but conjure it up. On the one side, the high-born, bucks, the mincing ladies, the scheming courtiers, pushing and planning\\n\\n\\\"Of course, you see that the whole thing is to scale. My warship of the, future carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much, larger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet., Or I might have a separate raft, possibly, to carry my apparatus. My, ship goes into action. What happens then, Munro? Eh, what! Every shot, fired at her goes smack on to the magnet. There's a reservoir below into, which they drop when the electric circuit is broken. After every action, they are sold by auction for old metal, and the result divided as prize, money among the crew. But think of it, man! I tell you it is an absolute, impossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my, apparatus. And then look at the cheapness. You don't want armour. You, want nothing. Any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of, these. The war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound, ten. You're grinning again; but if you give me a magnet and a Brixton, trawler with a seven-pounder gun I'll show sport to the finest, battle-ship afloat.\\\"\\n\\nOf course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the, question. I could not feed one, far less pay one, and I had no kitchen, furniture. I must open my door to my own patients--let them think what, they would of it. I must clean my own plate and brush down my own front;, and these duties must be thoroughly done, come what might, for I must, show a presentable outside to the public. Well, there was no great, hardship in that, for I could do it under the cover of night. But I had, had a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely. She, had written to say that if I wished she would send my little brother, Paul to keep me company. I wrote back eagerly to agree. He was a hardy, cheery little fellow of nine, who would, I knew, gladly share hard times, with me; while, if they became unduly so, I could always have him taken, home again. Some weeks must pass before he could come, but it cheered me, to think of him. Apart from his company, there were a thousand ways in, which he might be useful.\\n\\nPoor chap, he had little enough to be cheery over either. He was an old, soldier who had lost a good many teeth, but who had continued to find, room between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe. Lately there, appeared a small sore on his nose which had spread, and become crusted., On feeling it I found it as hard as a streak of glue, with constant, darting pains passing through it. Of course, there could be no question, as to diagnosis. It was epitheliomatous cancer, caused by the irritation, of the hot tobacco smoke. I sent him back to his village, and two days, after I drove over in Cullingworth's dog-cart, and removed the growth. I, only got a sovereign for it. But it may be a nucleus for cases. The, old fellow did most admirably, and he has just been in (with a most, aristocratic curl to his nostrils) to tell me that he has bought a box, full of churchwardens. It was my first operation, and I daresay I was, more nervous about it than my patient, but the result has given me, confidence. I have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me. Come, what may, I am prepared to do it. Why should a man wait? Of course\\n\\nhowever, that at its best it is not worth more than L700 a year, with no, room for expansion. This is not large enough to keep two of us at work., Then, again, there are times when I can see that my religious opinions, annoy the dear old man. On the whole, and for every reason, I think, that it would be better if I were out of this. I applied for several, steamship lines, and for at least a dozen house surgeonships; but there, is as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as, if it were the Viceroyship of India. As a rule, I simply get my, testimonials returned without any comment, which is the sort of thing, that teaches a man humility. Of course, it is very pleasant to live with, the mater, and my little brother Paul is a regular trump. I am teaching, him boxing; and you should see him put his tiny fists up, and counter, with his right. He got me under the jaw this evening, and I had to ask, for poached eggs for supper.\\n\\nI wrote to you last on the night that I reached here. Next morning I set, to work upon my task. You would be surprised (at least I was) to see, how practical and methodical I can be. First of all I walked down to the, post-office and I bought a large shilling map of the town. Then back I, came and pinned this out upon the lodging-house table. This done, I set, to work to study it, and to arrange a series of walks by which I should, pass through every street of the place. You have no idea what that means, until you try to do it. I used to have breakfast, get out about ten\\n\\nIt was a newspaper cutting, which gave the true account of the incident., Suffice it that it was an ice accident, and that Cullingworth had really, behaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible, with, the child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered, his senses that they were able to separate them. I had hardly finished, reading it when we heard his step on the stairs; and she, thrusting, the paper back into her bosom, became in an instant the same silently, watchful woman as ever.\\n\\nwhich might no doubt involve some technical impossibility, but which, would at least be quite plausible and new. Then as he drew, his, bristling eyebrows would contract, his small eyes would gleam with, excitement, his lips would be pressed together, and he would end by, banging on the paper with his open hand, and shouting in his exultation., You would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes., But next instant, if you were to express surprise as to how it was that, the Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids, out, would come the pencil and envelope, and he would propound a scheme for, doing that with equal energy and conviction. This ingenuity was joined, to an extremely sanguine nature. As he paced up and down in his jerky, quick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention, he would, take out patents for it, receive you as his partner in the enterprise\\n\\n, I was so delighted, my dear chap, to have your assurance that nothing, that I have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend, you. It is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved I was at your, cordial letter. I have no one to whom I can talk upon such matters. I, am all driven inwards, and thought turns sour when one lets it, stagnate like that. It is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a, sympathetic listener--and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all, from another standpoint. It steadies and sobers one.\\n\\n\\\"By ----, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, \\\"I've asked every ---- man in, Birchespool that's got anything the matter with him. You'll have the, lot as patients within a week. There's Fraser, who's got a touch of, Martell's three star. He's coming. And there's Saunders, who talks about, nothing but his spleen. I'm sick of his ---- spleen! But I asked him., And there's Turpey's wound! This wet weather sets it tingling, and his, own surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline. He'll be there. And, there's Carr, who is drinking himself to death. He has not much for the, doctors, but what there is you may as well have.\\\"\\n\\nHis carriage was waiting, and we drove out to his residence, The, Myrtles, where I was speedily introduced both to his family and his, practice. The former is small, and the latter enormous. The wife is, dead; but her mother, Mrs. White, keeps house for him; and there are two, dear little girls, about five and seven. Then there is an unqualified, assistant, a young Irish student, who, with the three maids, the, coachman, and the stable boy, make up the whole establishment. When I, tell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do, you will, have an idea of the ground we cover.\\n\\nBut then our individuality? I often wonder whether something of that, wilt cling to our atoms--whether the dust of Johnnie Munro will ever, have something of him about it, and be separable from that of Bertie, Swanborough. I think it is possible that we DO impress ourselves upon, the units of our own structure. There are facts which tend to show that, every tiny organic cell of which a man is composed, contains in its, microcosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a, part. The ovum itself from which we are all produced is, as you know\\n\\n\\\"Let us see!\\\" says she, looking at the slate. \\\"He will be clear at seven, minutes past eight this evening. Yes, he could just manage it then. He, has no one at all from seven past to the quarter past\\\"--and so at the, appointed hour I have my patient precipitating himself into my room with, the demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a, railway station. If he knew that he is probably the only patient who has, opened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry--or think so, much of my advice.\\n\\n\\\"That's it,\\\" he shouted, stabbing at me with the amber. \\\"Naval supremacy, and command of the seas. It's all here right under your nose. I tell, you, Munro, I could go to Switzerland to-morrow, and I could say to, them--'Look here, you haven't got a seaboard and you haven't got a port;, but just find me a ship, and hoist your flag on it, and I'll give you, every ocean under heaven.' I'd sweep the seas until there wasn't a, match-box floating on them. Or I could make them over to a limited, company, and join the board after allotment. I hold the salt water in, the cup of this hand, every drop of it.\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed again in the most good-humoured way, and, as soon as, the young fellow had recovered, we all joined in quite a confidential, conversation. It is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities, of life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette. In half an hour we knew, all about each other, or at any rate I knew all about them. Mrs. La, Force was the mother's name, a widow with these two children. They had, given up housekeeping, and found it more pleasant to live in apartments\\n\\n\\\"I take a cursed interest in the whole thing. You may think it a ----, impertinence, but that's the way I'm made. As long as I can steam I'll, throw a rope to whoever wants a tow. I'll tell you what I'll do, Dr., Munro, sir. I'll stand on one tack if you'll stand on the other, and, I'll let you know if I come across anything that will do.\\\"\\n\\nThis train of thought is the after-swell from an argument with, Cullingworth this evening. He holds that the human race is deteriorating, mentally and morally. He calls out at the grossness which confounds the, Creator with a young Jewish Philosopher. I tried to show him that this, is no proof of degeneration, since the Jewish Philosopher at least, represented a moral idea, and was therefore on an infinitely higher, plane than the sensual divinities of the ancients. His own views of the, Creator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration. He declares, that looking round at Nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and, brutality. \\\"Either the Creator is not all-powerful, or else He is not, all-good,\\\" says he. \\\"Either He can stop these atrocities and won't, in, which case He is not all-good; or else He would stop them but can't, in, which case He is not all-powerful.\\\" It was a difficult dilemma for a man, who professes to stick to reason to get out of. Of course, if you plead, faith, you can always slip out of anything. I was forced to get behind, a corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own, thrusts. I said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted, that that which seemed evil really was EVIL. \\\"It lies with you to prove, that it isn't,\\\" said he. \\\"We may hope that it isn't,\\\" said I. \\\"Wait, until some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the, stomach,\\\" said he; and he shouted it out again every time I tried to, renew the argument.\\n\\nand I was going to leave Cullingworth at once. Then within a couple, of posts I had to write again and announce that my departure was, indefinitely postponed, and that I was actually doing his whole, practice. Well, the dear old lady was very angry. I don't suppose she, quite understood how temporary the necessity was, and how impossible it, would have been to leave Cullingworth in the lurch. She was silent for, nearly three weeks, and then she wrote a very stinging letter (and she, handles her adjectives most deftly when she likes). She went so far, as to say that Cullingworth was a \\\"bankrupt swindler,\\\" and that I had, dragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association, with him. This letter came on the morning of the very last day that my, patient was confined to the house. When I returned from work I found him, sitting in his dressing-gown downstairs. His wife, who had driven home\\n\\nIn the morning I went round to Mrs. La Force and gave her a bulletin., Her brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left., He had the Victoria Cross it seems, and was one of the desperate little, garrison who held Lucknow in that hell-whirl of a mutiny. And now the, sudden opening of a door sets him shaking, and a dropped tongs gives him, palpitations. Are we not the strangest kind of beings?\\n\\nWell, matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up, to the Dad saying that Mrs. Andrews' servant was ill, and would he come, at once. The old man had a touch of gout, so I donned my professional, coat and sallied forth, thinking that perhaps I might combine pleasure, with business, and have a few words with Laura. Sure enough, as I passed, up the gravel drive which curves round to the door, I glanced through, the drawing-room window, and saw her sitting painting, with her back, to the light. It was clear that she had not heard me. The hall door was, ajar, and when I pushed it open, no one was in the hall. A sudden fit, of roguishness came over me. I pushed the drawing-room door very slowly, wider, crept in on tiptoe, stole quietly across, and bending down, I, kissed the artist upon the nape of her neck. She turned round with a, squeal, and it was the mother!\\n\\nwhich was as extraordinary as everything else he did. I won't tell it, to you here, my dear Bertie, for I feel that I have dived down too many, side streets already; but it was a most bustling business, in which the, locking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of Cullingworth's, hair played prominent parts. Apropos of the latter he was never quite, able to get rid of its traces; and from this time forward there was, added to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight, struck upon his hair at certain angles, it turned it all iridescent and, shimmering.\\n\\nWe had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both, of us, without, however, any allusion to our past quarrel. He would, not admit that he had left Bradfield on account of a falling-off in his, practice, or for any reason except that he found the place too small., His spring-screen invention had, he said, been favourably reported upon, by one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the Clyde, and there, was every probability of their adopting it.\\n\\n\\\"Why the devil should we do all the good, Munro?\\\" he shouts. \\\"Eh, what? A, butcher would do good to the race, would he not, if he served his chops, out gratis through the window? He'd be a real benefactor; but he goes, on selling them at a shilling the pound for all that. Take the case of, a doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science. He flushes out drains\\n\\nAnd then the more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance, not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound, interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been, accumulated since the dawning of time. Some eighty thousand years are, supposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man. Yet, in all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of, chipping them. But within our father's lives what changes have there not, been? The railway and the telegraph, chloroform and applied electricity., Ten years now go further than a thousand then, not so much on account, of our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to, more. Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain, footsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal.\\n\\nWe filed off once more, he leading with the huge brass \\\"Dr. Munro\\\", under his arm; then the little woman, and then this rather perturbed, and bemuddled young man. He and his wife sat on the deal table in the, consulting room, like a hawk and a turtle-dove on the same perch, while, I leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets. Nothing, could be more prosaic and informal; but I knew very well that I was at a, crisis of my life. Before, it was only a choosing between two roads. Now, my main track had run suddenly to nothing, and I must go back or find a, bye-path.\\n\\nAm I not the slowest of story-tellers? But you encourage me to it by, your sympathetic interest in details. However, I shall move along a, little faster now. Next morning I was off to Lochtully, which, as you, know, is in the north of Perthshire. It stands three miles from the, station, a great gray pinnacled house, with two towers cocking out above, the fir woods, like a hare's ears from a tussock of grass. As we drove, up to the door I felt pretty solemn--not at all as the main line should, do when it condescends to visit the cadet branch. Into the hall as I, entered came a grave learned-looking man, with whom in my nervousness, I was about to shake hands cordially. Fortunately he forestalled the, impending embrace by explaining that he was the butler. He showed, me into a small study, where everything stank of varnish and morocco, leather, there to await the great man. He proved when he came to be a, much less formidable figure than his retainer--indeed, I felt thoroughly, at my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth. He is grizzled\\n\\nSo those were the last words of Cullingworth, and the last that I may, ever see of him also, for he starts almost immediately upon his strange, venture. He must succeed. He is a man whom nothing could hold down. I, wish him luck, and have a kindly feeling towards him, and yet I distrust, him from the bottom of my heart, and shall be just as pleased to know, that the Atlantic rolls between us.\\n\\nThey moved in a few days later. I was out at the time, and the first, intimation I had was finding three little dogs in my hall when I, returned. I had her up, and explained that this was a breach of, contract, and that I had no thoughts of running a menagerie. She pleaded, very hard for her little dogs, which it seems are a mother and two, daughters of some rare breed; so I at last gave in on the point., The other sister appeared to lead a subterranean troglodytic sort of, existence; for, though I caught a glimpse of her whisking round the, corner at times, it was a good month before I could have sworn to her in, a police court.\"\n        ],\n

She was dressed as for a journey, and about the corners, of her mouth were lines familiar to Christopher, the sight of which sent, his heart into his boots. Fortunately, he recovered himself in time to, greet her with a smile. It was not the smile he had been rehearsing half, the day, but that it was a smile of any sort astonished the words away, from Mrs. Korner's lips, and gave him the inestimable advantage of first, speech.\\n\\n\\\"I was unable to oblige you before,\\\" explained Mr. Korner, \\\"having to, keep my head clear for business, and not knowing what the effect upon, one might be. Yesterday I did my best, and I hope you are pleased with, me. Though, if you could see your way to being content--just for the, present and until I get more used to it--with a similar performance not, oftener than once a fortnight, say, I should be grateful,\\\" added Mr., Korner.\\n\\n\\\"We had one bottle of claret between us,\\\" Mr. Korner would often recall, to his mind, \\\"of which he drank the greater part. And then he brought, out the little green flask. He said it was made from pears--that in Peru, they kept it specially for Children's parties. Of course, that may have, been his joke; but in any case I cannot see how just one glass--I wonder, could I have taken more than one glass while he was talking.\\\" It was a, point that worried Mr. Korner.\\n\\nThe \\\"he\\\" who had talked, possibly, to such bad effect was a distant, cousin of Mr. Korner's, one Bill Damon, chief mate of the steamship, _La Fortuna_. Until their chance meeting that afternoon in Leadenhall, Street, they had not seen each other since they were boys together. The, _Fortuna_ was leaving St. Katherine's Docks early the next morning bound, for South America, and it might be years before they met again. As Mr., Damon pointed out, Fate, by thus throwing them into each other's arms\\n\\n\\\"Sorry I am late,\\\" said Mr. Korner, bursting cheerfully into the room., It was a point with Mr. Korner always to be cheerful in the morning., \\\"Greet the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing,\\\" was, the motto Mrs. Korner, this day a married woman of six months and three, weeks standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on, precisely two hundred and two occasions. The Motto entered largely into, the scheme of Mr. Korner's life. Written in fine copperplate upon cards, all of the same size, a choice selection counselled him each morning, from the rim of his shaving-glass.\\n\\n\\\"You sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached, eggs, while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table. At, the end of it, seeing you had gone to sleep yourself, I persuaded her, to go to bed. It was three o'clock, and we thought you would not mind.\\\", Miss Greene drew up a chair, and, with her elbows on the table, looked, across at Mr. Korner. Decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of Mrs., Korner's bosom friend.\\n\\nMr. Korner sat up suddenly and looked about him. This was not bed., The fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the, tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A, tingling sensation about his head called for investigation. Mr. Korner, was forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a, salad of him--somebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard. A, sound directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.\\n\\nThe sight of Acacia Villa, suggesting that everybody was in bed and, asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife would have been, sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting, on the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As, the door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring., The window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.\\n\\nit suddenly occurred to Mr. Korner that he was an unappreciated man., Mrs. Korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which, the beauties of the Southern Main endeavoured feebly to express their, consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no way--as far as he could, see--to Mr. Korner himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner, did say and did do, tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes. Noticing that, a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and, hurried on. Pacing the platform of the Mansion House Station, where, it is always draughty, the thought of his wrongs returned to him with, renewed force. Why was there no trace of doglike devotion about Mrs., Korner? The fault--so he bitterly told himself--the fault was his., \\\"A woman loves her master; it is her instinct,\\\" mused Mr. Korner to, himself. \\\"Damme,\\\" thought Mr. Korner, \\\"I don't believe that half her, time she knows I am her master.\\\"\\n\\nThe two friends talked of many things. And later on they spoke of, sweethearts and of wives. Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been, wide and varied. They talked--or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr., Korner listened--of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of, the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian, valleys. The mate had theories concerning the care and management of, women: theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood, the test of studied application. A new world opened out to Mr. Korner;, a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who\",\n          \"and such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you., You said what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered, to no one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost, like a gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the, devil himself. Why should you? While your cousin Philip, with his, parrot talk and sneaking ways, turned my stomach. I was sick of him\\n\\nScarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon Mrs., Manners. Her first care, and Dorothy's, was to catechise me most, particularly on my state. And whilst they were so occupied Mr. Marmaduke, entered, wholly frenzied from fright, and utterly oblivious to his own, blame in the matter. He was sent out again directly. After that, with, Aunt Lucy to assist, they hurriedly packed what few things might be, taken. The costly relics of Arlington Street were untouched, and the, French clock was left on the mantel to tick all the night, and for days, to come, in a silent and forsaken room; or perhaps to greet impassively, the King's officers when they broke in at the door. But I caught my lady, in the act of wrapping up the Wedgwood cups and dishes.\\n\\nalways chosen by my lady herself. There I sat by the hour, swathed in, many layers of wool, and tended by her hands alone. Every nook and, cranny of our lives were revealed to the other. She loved to hear of, Patty and my years at Gordon's, and would listen with bated breath to the, stories of the Ranger and the Bonhomme Richard, and of that strange man, whom we both loved, whose genius had made those cruises famous., Sometimes, in low voices, we talked of our future; but often, when the, wind blew and the deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters, a, silence would fall between us that needed no word to interpret.\\n\\nlaunching forth at once, nothing daunted by such cold conservatism., \\\"What Israelite brickmaker of Pharaoh's dreamed of Solomon's temple?, Nay, Moses himself had no conception of it. And God will send us our, pillars of cloud and of fire. We must be reconciled to our great, destiny, Mr. Carroll. No fight ever was won by man or nation content, with half a victory. We have forests to build an hundred armadas, and I, will command a fleet and it is given me.\\\"\\n\\nNot a sound came from Dorothy, nor did I dare to look at her face. The, whole matter was clear to me now. After his conversation with me, Mr., Marmaduke had lost no time in seeing Mr. Dix, in order to raise money on, my prospects. And the man of business had gone straight to Grafton with, the intelligence. The suspicion flashed through me that Mr. Allen had, been sent to spy, but his very next words disarmed it.\\n\\nThen a cry came floating down from aloft. Thrice did I hear it, like one, waking out of a sleep, ere I grasped its import. \\\"The Alliance! The, Alliance!\\\" But hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the, ship, when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft, forward. \\\"She rakes us! She rakes us!\\\" And the French soldiers tumbled, headlong down from the poop with a wail of \\\"Les Anglais font prise!\\\", \\\"Her Englishmen have taken her, and turned her guns against us!\\\" Our, captain was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and, stripes waved black in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what, happened next. The gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down, his face, shouting that the Richard was sinking, and yelling for quarter, as he made for the ensign-staff on the poop, for the flag was shot away., Him the commodore felled with a pistol-butt. At the gunner's heels were, the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken, released by the master at, arms. They swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of, Tartars, unkempt and wild and desperate with fear, until I thought that, the added weight on the scarce-supported deck would land us all in the, bilges. Words fail me when I come to describe the frightful panic of, these creatures, frenzied by the instinct of self-preservation. They, surged hither and thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a, storm-swept coast. They trampled rough-shod over the moaning heaps of, wounded and dying, and crowded the crews at the guns, who were powerless, before their numbers. Some fought like maniacs, and others flung, themselves into the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, \\\"you have not dined, and neither have I. We shall be, merry to-day, and you shall have some of the best Madeira in the, colonies.\\\" I commanded a room, that we might have privacy. As he took, his seat opposite me I marked that he had grown heavier and more browned., But his eye had the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore. And, first I upbraided him for not having writ me.\\n\\nThe door creaked, and in my eagerness I tried to lift myself. 'Twas Aunt, Lucy's hand that restrained me, and the next face I saw was that of, Dorothy's mother. But why did it appear so old and sorrow-lined? And, why was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap? She took, my fingers in her own, and asked me anxiously if I felt any pain.\\n\\n\\\"Despite the host of troubles he had on his hands, your commodore himself, came with us to Rotterdam. Now I protest I love that man, who has more, humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in England who call him, hard names. If you could have seen him leaning over you, and speaking to, you, and feeling every minute for your heart-beats, egad, you would have, cried. And when I took you off to the schooner, he gave me an hundred, directions how to care for you, and then his sorrow bowled him all in a, heap.\\\"\\n\\nWhen I came on deck the next morning our yards were a-drip with a clammy, fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze. We were, standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused, in the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, and that we, were near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all, that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though, we had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my, eyes through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our, starboard beam.\\n\\nMrs. Manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to Carvel Hall. It was, on a sparkling morning in February that we sighted the familiar toe of, Kent Island, and the good-natured skipper put about and made for the, mouth of our river. Then, as of old, the white cupola of Carvel House, gleamed a signal of greeting, to which our full hearts beat a silent, response. Once again the great windmill waved its welcome, and the same, memory was upon us both as we gazed. Of a hale old gentleman in the, sheets of a sailing pinnace, of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering, with excitement of the days to come. Dorothy gently pressed my hand as, the bark came into the wind, and the boat was dropped into the green, water. Slowly they lowered me into it, for I was still helpless, Dorothy, and her mother and Aunt Lucy were got down, and finally Mr. Marmaduke, stepped gingerly from the sea-ladder over the gunwale. The cutter leaped, under the strong strokes up the river with the tide. Then, as we rounded, the bend, we were suddenly astonished to see people gathered on the, landing at the foot of the lawn, where they had run, no doubt, in a, flurry at sight of the ship below. In the front of the group stood, out a strangely familiar figure.\\n\\nFifty and five minutes had been registered by the French clock, when the, rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below, and Charles Fox, panted up the stairs, muffled in a huge wrap-rascal. 'Twas he and Aunt, Lucy carried me down to the street, Dorothy walking at my side, and, propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting., This was an ample travelling-carriage with a lamp hanging from its top\\n\\nSuddenly, glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were, aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big, Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great, ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the, mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes, sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the, commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our, guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.\\n\\nBefore we could answer he was gone into the night; and my Lord, standing, without, had closed the carriage door. And that was the last I saw of, this noble man, the true friend of America, who devoted his glorious, talents and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the, greatness of England. He who was followed by the prayers of the English, race was ever remembered in our own humble ones.\\n\\nwaited on by the old servants of my grandfather. At our whim my chair, would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts; on cool days, we sat in the sun by the dial, where the flowers mingled their odours, with the salt breezes off the Chesapeake; or anon, when it was warmer, in, the summer-house my mother loved, or under the shade of the great trees, on the lawn, looking out over the river. And once my lady went off very, mysteriously, her eyes brimful of mischief, to come back with the first, strawberries of the year staining her apron.\\n\\nLord Comyn and Mr. Fox. They may do something for you, now you own your, estate. My dear sir, I dislike to say aught against any man. Mrs., Manners will tell you of their kindness to us, but I vow I have not been, able to see it. With all the money at their command they will not loan, me a penny in my pressing need. And I shame to say it, my own daughter, prevents me from obtaining the money to keep us out of the Fleet. I know, she has spoken to Dulany. Think of it, Richard, my own daughter, upon, whom I lavished all when I had it, who might have made a score of grand, matches when I gave her the opportunity, and now we had all been rolling, in wealth. I'll be sworn I don't comprehend her, nor her mother either\\n\\n\\\"I have seen many men since, but never have I met your equal for a most, damnable frankness, Richard Carvel. Even Jack, here, is not half so, blunt and uncompromising. But you took my fancy--God knows why!--that, first night I clapped eyes on you in Arlington Street, and I loved you, when your simplicity made us that speech at Brooks's Club. So you have, not forgotten that morning under the trees, when the dew was on the, grass. Faith, I am glad of it. What children we were!\\\" he said, and, sighed.\\n\\nthough not very handsomely. Fears for my own safety alone kept me from, telling you and Mr. Swain. And I swear to you that I was sorry for the, venture almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling., The scheme was laid out before I took you for a pupil; indeed, that was, part of it, as you no doubt have guessed. As God hears me, I learned to, love you, Richard, in those days at the rectory. You were all of a man\\n\\n\\\"Ay, he's back,\\\" he returned, with a grunt that was half a growl; \\\"arter, three weeks breakin' o' liberty. I tell 'ee what, sir, them Frenchies is, treecherous devils, an' not to be trusted the len'th of a lead line. An', they beant seamen eno' to keep a full an' by with all their 'takteek'., Ez fer that Landais, I hearn him whinin' at the commodore in the round, house when we was off Clear, an' sayin' as how he would tell Sartin on us, when he gets back to Paree. An' jabberin to th'other Frenchmen as was, there that this here butter-cask was er King's ship, an' that the, commodore weren't no commodore nohow. They say as how Cap'n Jones be, bound up in a hard knot by some articles of agreement, an' daresn't, punish him. Be that so, Mr. Carvel?\\\"\\n\\nAs few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of Charles, James Fox and of John Paul Jones. The latter hero actually made a voyage, in the brigantine 'John' about the time he picked up Richard Carvel from, the Black Moll, after the episode with Mungo Maxwell at Tobago. The, Scotch scene, of course, is purely imaginary. Accuracy has been aimed at, in the account of the fight between the 'Bonhomme Richard' and the, 'Serapis', while a little different arrangement might have been better, for the medium of the narrative. To be sure, it was Mr. Mease, the, purser, instead of Richard Carvel, who so bravely fought the quarter-deck, guns; and in reality Midshipman Mayrant, Commodore Jones's aide, was, wounded by a pike in the thigh after the surrender. No injustice is done, to the second and third lieutenants, who were absent from the ship during, the action.\\n\\n\\\"You will cherish her, Richard,\\\" he said brokenly, \\\"for her like is not, to be found in this world. I knew her worth when first she came to, London, as arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance. I saw then that a, great love alone was needed to make her the highest among women, and from, the night I fought with you at the Coffee House I have felt upon whom, that love would fall. O thou of little faith,\\\" he cried, \\\"what little I, may have done has been for her. No, Richard, you do not deserve her, but, I would rather think of her as your wife than that of any man living.\\\"\\n\\nI cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after Mr. Swain's death., One hope had lightened all the years of my servitude. For, when I, examined my soul, I knew that it was for Dorothy I had laboured. And, every letter that came from Comyn telling me she was still free gave me, new heart for my work. By some mystic communion--I know not what--I felt, that she loved me yet, and despite distance and degree. I would wake of, a morning with the knowledge of it, and be silent for half the day with, some particle of a dream in my head, lingering like the burden of a song, with its train of memories.\\n\\nIn the meantime the American frigate 'Alliance' had brought Lafayette to, France, and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the, 'Bon homme Richard'. One of the most fatal mistakes Congress ever made, was to put Captain Pierre Landais in command of her, out of compliment to, the French allies. He was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to, get him a command in his own navy. His insulting conduct and treachery, to Captain Jones are strongly attested to in Mr. Carvel's manuscript:, they were amply proved by the written statements of other officers.\\n\\n\\\"A hawser, Mr. Stacey, a hawser!\\\" I heard the commodore shout, and saw, the sailing-master slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and, wounded and mass of broken spars and tackles, and finally pick up a, smeared rope's end, which I helped him drag to the poop. There we found, the commodore himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the, severed stays and shrouds dangling from the bowsprit, the French marines, looking on.\\n\\n\\\"No one knows of it, Richard, or is likely to. Dr. Barry, like so many, in England, is a good Whig and friend to America. And you are in a part, of London far removed from Mayfair.\\\" She hesitated, and then continued, in a voice that strove to be lighter: \\\"This little house is in Charlotte, Street, Mary-le-Bone, for the war has made all of us suffer some. And we, are more fortunate than many, for we are very comfortable here, and, though I say it, happier than in Arlington Street. And the best of our, friends are still faithful. Mr. Fox, with all his greatness, has never, deserted us, nor my Lord Comyn. Indeed, we owe them much more than I can, tell you of now,\\\" she said, and sighed. \\\"They are here every day of the, world to inquire for you, and it was his Lordship brought you out of, Holland.\\\"\\n\\nA master might picture my happiness, waking and sleeping, through the, short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light. The, memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe, a little more rounded, than of yore, and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the, world's mysteries. Dorothy had looked the lady in rags, and housewife's, cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades. When for any, reason she was absent from my side, I moped, to the quiet amusement of, Mrs. Manners and the more boisterous delight of Aunt Lucy, who took her, turn sewing in the window. I was near to forgetting the use of words\\n\\nNo one may read the annals of these men, who were at once brave and, courtly, and of these women, who were ladies by nature as well as by, birth, and not love them. The fascination of that free and hospitable, life has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it, with a genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to, the pleasure he has derived from the history of Maryland.\\n\\nThe squadron sailed from L'Orient in June, but owing to a collision, between the Bon homme Richard and the Alliance it was forced to put back, into the Groix roads for repairs. Nails and rivets were with difficulty, got to hold in the sides of the old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul, Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels:, Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve;, and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed, upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have, absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf, parted company, never to return. After the most outrageous conduct off, the coast of Ireland, Landais, in the 'Alliance', left the squadron on, September 6th, and did not reappear until the 23d, the day of the battle.\\n\\nBefore Christmas we went to the Eastern Shore. In Annapolis fife and, drum had taken the place of fiddle and clarion; militia companies were, drilling in the empty streets; despatches were arriving daily from the, North; and grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings. But if the war was, to come, I must settle what was to be done at Gordon's Pride with all, possible speed. It was only a few days after our going there, that I, rode into Oxford with a black cockade in my hat Patty had made me, and, the army sword Captain Jack had given Captain Daniel at my side. For I, had been elected a lieutenant in the Oxford company, of which Percy, Singleton was captain.\\n\\nI smiled, but more in sadness than amusement. Hardship had only degraded, Mr. Marmaduke the more, and even in trouble his memory was convenient as, is that of most people in prosperity. I was of no mind to jog his, recollection. But I wanted badly to ask about his Grace. Where had my, fine nobleman been at the critical point of his friend's misfortunes?, For I had had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk, with McAndrews.\\n\\n\\\"I came here to-night to betray you, and might have gone hence to your, uncle to claim my pieces of silver. I remain to tell you that Grafton, has an appointment at nine with his Majesty's chief Secretary of State., I need not mention his motives, nor dwell upon your peril. For the, King's sentiments toward Paul Jones are well known. You must leave, London without delay, and so must Mr. Manners and his family.\\\"\\n\\npresently to be pieced together. The injuries Mr. Marmaduke had done me, were the first to collect, since I was searching for the cause of my, resentment against him. The incidents arrived haphazard as magic, lanthorn views, but very vivid. His denial of me before Mr. Dix, and his, treachery at Vauxhall, when he had sent me to be murdered. Next I felt, myself clutching the skin over his ribs in Arlington Street, when I had, flung him across the room in his yellow night-gown. That brought me to, the most painful scene of my life, when I had parted with Dorothy at the, top of the stairs. Afterward followed scraps of the years at Gordon's, Pride, and on top of them the talk with McAndrews. Here was the secret, I sought. The crash had come. And they were no longer in Mayfair, but, must have taken a house in some poorer part of London. This thought cast, me down tremendously.\\n\\n\\\"Orchardson died before I had made one voyage,\\\" he replied, \\\"and the, Betsy changed owners. But I did not forget you, Richard, and was, resolved but now not to leave Maryland until I had seen you. But I burn, to hear of you,\\\" he added. \\\"I have had an inkling of your story from the, landlord. So your grandfather is dead, and that blastie, your uncle, of, whom you told me on the John, is in possession.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and, stripes over a man-o'-war. They got away on November 14, 1777, with a, fair crew and a poor lot of officers. Mr. Carvel had many a brush with, the mutinous first lieutenant Simpson. Family influence deterred the, captain from placing this man under arrest, and even Dr. Franklin found, trouble, some years after, in bringing about his dismissal from the, service. To add to the troubles, the Ranger proved crank and, slow-sailing; and she had only one barrel of rum aboard, which made, the men discontented.\\n\\nThose of us who had clung to hope lost it then. Standing with my back, to the mast, beating them off with a pike, visions of an English, prison-ship, of an English gallows, came before me. I counted the, seconds until the enemy's seamen would be pouring through our ragged, ports. The seventh and last time, and we were beaten, for we had not men, enough left on our two decks to force them down again. Yes,--I shame to, confess it--the heart went clean out of me, and with that the pain, pulsed and leaped in my head like a devil unbound. At a turn of the hand, I should have sunk to the boards, had not a voice risen strong and clear, above that turmoil, compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps.\\n\\n\\\"And now I shall tell you something of the story of the Duke of, Chartersea,\\\" she went on, and I felt her tremble as she spoke that name., \\\"I think of all we have Lord Comyn to thank for, next to saving your life, twice, was his telling you of the danger I ran. And, Richard, after, refusing you that day on the balcony over the Park, I had no hope left., You may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in London, after that. Richard,\\\" she said, \\\"do you recall my asking you in the, coach, on the way from Castle Yard, for the exact day you met my father, in Arlington Street?\\\"\\n\\nand then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet. For the old, archness, at least, would never be eradicated. Presently, after she had, taken the cup and smoothed my pillow, I reached out for her hand. It was, a boldness of which I had not believed myself capable; but she did not, resist, and even, as I thought, pressed my fingers with her own slender, ones, the red of our Maryland holly blushing in her cheeks. And what, need of words, indeed! Our thoughts, too, flew coursing hand in hand, through primrose paths, and the angels themselves were not to be envied.\\n\\n\\\"And I possessed the love of such a woman, Richard,\\\" he said, in another, tone, \\\"I think I should die of happiness. She will never tell you how, these weeks past she has scarce left your side. The threats combined, of her mother and the doctor, and Charles and me, would not induce her, to take any sleep. And time and time have I walked from here to Brook, Street without recognizing a step of the way, lifted clear out of myself, by the sight of her devotion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are always finding friends, Richard,\\\" said he; \\\"no matter what your, misfortunes, they are ever double discounted. As for me; I am like, Fulmer in Mr. Cumberland's 'West Indian': 'I have beat through every, quarter of the compass; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to, serve my country; I have'--I am engaging to betray it. No, Scotland is, no longer my country, and so I cannot betray her. It is she who has, betrayed me.\\\"\\n\\nMy own duties took me to the dark lower deck, a vile place indeed, and, reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals. There I had charge of, the battery of old eighteens, while Mr. Dale commanded the twelves on the, middle deck. We loaded our guns with two shots apiece, though I had my, doubts about their standing such a charge, and then the men stripped, until they stood naked to the waist, waiting for the fight to begin. For, we could see nothing of what was going forward. I was pacing up and, down, for it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the, gun-ports closed, when about three bells of the dog, Mr. Mease, the, purser, appeared on the ladder.\\n\\nThat the rough and bluff captains of the American service should have, regarded a man of Paul Jones's type with suspicion is not surprising., They resented his polish and accomplishments, and could not understand, his language. Perhaps it was for this reason, as well as a reward for, his brilliant services, that he was always given a separate command. In, the summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power, of the United States, nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate, 'Indien', then building at Amsterdam. And he was ordered to France in, command of the 'Ranger', a new ship then fitting at Portsmouth. Captain, Jones was the admiration of all the young officers in the navy, and was, immediately flooded with requests to sail with him. One of his first, acts, after receiving his command, was to apply to the Marine Committee, for Mr. Carvel. The favour was granted.\\n\\n\\\"We are not yet an infant state, sir,\\\" Mr. Carroll put in, with a shade, of rebuke. For Maryland was well content with the government she had, enjoyed, and her best patriots long after shunned the length of, secession. \\\"I believe and pray that the King will come to his senses., And as for the navy, it is folly. How can we hope to compete with, England on the sea?\\\"\\n\\nrolling his quid to show his pleasure of the topic, \\\"they sits on their, bottoms in Brest and L'Oriong an' talks takteek wi' their han's and, mouths, and daresn't as much as show the noses o' their three-deckers in, th' Bay o' Biscay, while Cap'n Jones pokes his bowsprit into every port, in England with a hulk the rats have left. I've had my bellyful o', Frenchies, Mr. Carvell save it be to fight 'em. An' I tell 'ee 'twould, give me the greatest joy in life t' leave loose 'Scolding Sairy' at that, there Landais. Th' gal ain't had a match on her this here cruise, an' t', my mind she couldn't be christened better, sir.\\\"\\n\\nThe boatswains' whistles trilled through the ship, pikes were seized, and, pistol and cutlass buckled on. But even as we waited with set teeth, our, bows ground into the enemy's weather quarter-gallery. For the Richard's, rigging was much cut away, and she was crank at best. So we backed and, filled once more, passing the Englishman close aboard, himself being, aback at the time. Several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in, front of me, shattering a nine-pounder and killing half of its crew. And, it is only a miracle that I stand alive to be able to tell the tale., Then I caught a glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our, wheel, and over went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the, 'Serapis', where we might rake and rush her decks. Our old Indiaman, answered but doggedly; and the huge bowsprit of the Serapis, towering, over our heads, snapped off our spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen, rigging.\\n\\nAs a result of that trip he got the Duras, which he renamed the 'Bon, homme Richard' in honour of Dr. Franklin. The Duras was an ancient, Indiaman with a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw, her, at the remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy. She was, perfectly rotten, and in the constructor's opinion not worth refitting., Her lowest deck (too low for the purpose) was pierced aft with three, ports on a side, and six worn-out eighteen-pounders mounted there. Some, of them burst in the action, killing their people. The main battery, on, the deck above, was composed of twenty-eight twelve-pounders. On the, uncovered deck eight nine-pounders were mounted. Captain Jones again, showed his desire to serve the cause by taking such a ship, and not, waiting for something better.\\n\\nmy old tutor, and rector of St. Anne's. And 'twas a baffling, intangible, change. 'Twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face, for he was now, just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul. The, coarse wine and coarse food of the lower coffee-houses of London had, replaced the rich and abundant fare of Maryland. The next day was become, one of the terrors of his life. His clothes were of poor stuff, but, aimed at the fashion. And yet--and yet, as I looked upon him, a, something was in his face to puzzle me entirely. I had seen many stamps, of men, but this thing I could not recognize.\\n\\n\\\"You will not believe him, Richard,\\\" cried my Lord; \\\"you have only to, look at him to see that he lies. Take note of the ragged uniform of the, rebel army he carries, and then think of him 'en petite maitre', with his, cabriolet and his chestnuts. Egad, he might be as rich as Rigby were it, not for those principles which he chooses to deride. And I have seen him, reduced to a crown for them. I tell you, Richard,\\\" said my Lord, \\\"by, espousing your cause Charles is become greater than the King. For he, has the hearts of the English people, which George has not, and the, allegiance of you Americans, which George will never have. And if you, once heard him, in Parliament, you should hear him now, and see the, Speaker wagging his wig like a man bewitched, and hear friends and, enemies calling out for him to go on whenever he gives the sign of a, pause.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ill uncos, sir,\\\" he answered, shaking his head with violence. He had, indeed but a sorry tale for my ear, and one to make my heart heavier than, it was. McAndrews opened his mind to me, and seemed the better for it., How Mr. Marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was, more than the honest Scotchman could imagine. There was a country place, in Sussex now, said he, that was the latest. And drafts were coming in, before the wheat was in the ear; and the plantations of tobacco on the, Western Shore had been idle since the non-exportation, and were mortgaged, to their limit to Mr. Willard. Money was even loaned on the Wilmot House, estate. McAndrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither Mrs. Manners nor, Miss Dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs.\\n\\n\\\"Now, and never again, dear,\\\" she said. \\\"Yes, I saw and heard all that, passed in the drawing-room. And I did not blame, but praised you for it., I have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since. God, forgive me!\\\" she cried, \\\"but I have despised him from that hour. When, I knew that he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute, working, upon me to save his honour, of which he has not the smallest spark; that, he had recognized and denied you, friendless before our house, and sent, you into the darkness at Vauxhall to be murdered, then he was no father, of mine. I would that you might know what my mother has suffered from, such a man, Richard.\\\"\\n\\nIf the divine power of genius ever made itself felt, 'twas on that May, evening, at candle-light, in the Annapolis Coffee House. With my own, eyes I witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province, thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight, and twenty. As for good Captain Daniel, enthusiasm is but a poor word to, express his feelings. A map was sent for and spread out upon the table., And it was a late hour when Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll went home\\n\\nThe author makes most humble apologies to any who have, or think they, have, an ancestor in this book. He has drawn the foregoing with a very, free hand, and in the Maryland scenes has made use of names rather than, of actual personages. His purpose, however poorly accomplished, was to, give some semblance of reality to this part of the story. Hence he has, introduced those names in the setting, choosing them entirely at random, from the many prominent families of the colony.\\n\\nThey were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking, hatches, and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a, desperate vigour. Then, all at once, the towering mainmast of the enemy, cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds., The first intense silence of the battle followed, in the midst of which, came a cry from our top:\\n\\nNor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the Atlantic., We reached Lisbon in safety, and after a week of lodgings in that city by, the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for Baltimore. For, the Chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war, and kept alive the, credit of the young nation. There were many excitements ere we sighted, the sand-spits of Virginia, and off the Azores we were chased for a day, and a night by a British sloop of war. Our captain, however, was a cool, man and a seaman, and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the, Capes very triumphantly.\\n\\n\\\"What plan, sir!\\\" said Captain John Paul, those wonderful eyes of his, alight. \\\"In the first place, we Americans build the fastest ships in the, world,--yours of the Chesapeake are as fleet as any. Here, if I am not, mistaken, one hundred and eighty-two were built in the year '71. They, are idle now. To them I would issue letters of marque, to harry, England's trade. From Carolina to Maine we have the wood and iron to, build cruisers, in harbours that may not easily be got at. And skilled, masters and seamen to elude the enemy.\\\"\\n\\nMy heart bled for him. Some minutes passed that he did not speak, making, shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by, a strong emotion. \\\"'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was, greatest. Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles, in his coat, and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on, since Dolly and he and I had stood together on the Betsy's deck.\\n\\nWhen next consciousness came, the tarry, salt smell of a ship was in my, nostrils, and I knew that we were embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a, fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and, the tramp of feet on the deck above my head. Framed against the, irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water, beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.\\n\\nand the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead. At last, when I, was getting fairly restless, the distant tones of a voice, deep and, reverberating, smote upon my ear, jarring painfully some long-forgotten, chord. That voice belonged to but one man alive, and yet I could not, name him. Even as I strained, the tones drew nearer, and they were mixed, with sweeter ones I knew well, and Dorothy's mother's voice. Whilst I, was still searching, the door opened, the voices fell calm, and Dorothy, came in bearing a candle in each hand. As she set them down on the, table, I saw an agitation in her face, which she strove to hide as she, addressed me.\\n\\nThe scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning. A knot of, midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing Landais's conduct, and, cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up, short. Mr. Stacey, the sailing-master, had the deck, and the coasting, pilot was conning; now and anon the boatswain's whistle piped for Garrett, or Quito or Fogg to lay aft to the mast, where the first lieutenant stood, talking to Colonel de Chamillard, of the French marines. The scavengers, were sweeping down, and part of the after guard was bending a new, bolt-rope on a storm staysail.\\n\\nMr. Carvel's chapter opens with Landais's sudden reappearance on the, morning of the day the battle was fought. He shows the resentment and, anger against the Frenchman felt by all on board, from cabin-boy to, commodore. But none went so far as to accuse the captain of the, 'Alliance' of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action., Cowardice may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from, the two duels in which the Richard and the Pallas engaged. But the fact, that he poured broadsides into the Richard, and into her off side, makes, it seem probable that his motive was to sink the commodore's ship, and so, get the credit of saving the day, to the detriment of the hero who won it, despite all disasters. To account for the cry that was raised when first, she attacked the Richard, it must be borne in mind that the crew of the, 'Alliance' was largely composed of Englishmen. It was thought that these, had mutinied and taken her.\\n\\nAt noon, when I relieved Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun had eaten up the, fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming, up across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind, us. I had the starboard watch piped to dinner, and reported twelve, o'clock to the commodore. And had just got permission to \\\"make it,\\\", according to a time-honoured custom at sea, when another \\\"Sail, ho!\\\" came, down from aloft.\\n\\n\\\"Charles,\\\" I said, \\\"this is all of a piece with your old recklessness., You were ever one to take any risk, but I will not hear of such a venture, as this. Do you think I will allow the hope of all England to be staked, for a pirate? And would you break our commander of her rank? All that, Dorothy need do at Portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she, meets, and I'll warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain,\\\" I said to my old friend, \\\"I have a rare joy this day in making, known to you Mr. John Paul Jones, of whom I have spoken to you a score of, times. He it is whose bravery sank the Black Moll, whose charity took me, to London, and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in, a debtors' prison. For his honour, as I have told you, would allow him, to accept none, nor his principles to take the commission in the Royal, Navy which Mr. Fox offered him.\\\"\\n\\nThe room had a prodigious sense of change about it. That came over me, with something of a shock, since the moment before I had it settled that, I was in Marlboro' Street. The bare branches swaying in the wind outside, should belong to the trees in Freshwater Lane. But beyond the branches, were houses, the like of which I had no remembrance of in Annapolis. And, then my grandfather should be sitting in that window. Surely, he was, there! He moved! He was coming toward me to say: \\\"Richard, you are, forgiven,\\\" and to brush his eyes with his ruffles.\\n\\nShe closed the door softly behind her, and stood looking down upon me, with such a wondrous love-light in her eyes as no man may describe., My fancy had not lifted me within its compass, my dreams even had not, imagined it. And the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler, souls. So she stood gazing, those lips which once had been the seat of, pride now parted in a smile of infinite tenderness. But her head she, still held high, and her body straight. Down the front of her dress fell, a tucked apron of the whitest linen, and in her hand was a cup of, steaming broth.\\n\\nmy dear. Well, when the big British fleet sailed up the bay in '77, your, precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality., He began to correspond with the British at Philadelphia, and one of his, letters was captured near the Head of Elk. A squad was sent to the Kent, estate, where he had been living, to arrest him, but he made his escape, to New York. And his lands were at once confiscated by the state.\\\"\\n\\nBringing the official news of Burgoyne's surrender, which was to cause, King Louis to acknowledge the independence of the United States, the, Ranger arrived at Nantes, December 2. Mr. Carvel accompanied Captain, Jones to Paris, where a serious blow awaited him. The American, Commissioners informed him that the Indien had been transferred to France, to prevent her confiscation. That winter John Paul spent striving in, vain for a better ship, and imbibing tactics from the French admirals., Incidentally, he obtained a salute for the American flag. The cruise of, the Ranger in English waters the following spring was a striking, fulfilment, with an absurdly poor and inadequate force, of the plan set, forth by John Paul Jones in the Annapolis Coffee House. His descent upon, Whitehaven spread terror and consternation broadcast through England, and, he was branded as a pirate and a traitor. Mr. Carvel was fortunately not, of the landing party on St. Mary's Isle, which place he had last beheld, in John Paul's company, on the brigantine John, when entering, Kirkcudbright. The object of that expedition, as is well known, was to, obtain the person of the Earl of Selkirk, in order to bring about the, rescue of the unfortunate Americans suffering in British prisons. After, the celebrated capture of the sloop-of-war Drake, Paul Jones returned to, France a hero.\\n\\nAll that morning I pondered over the devious lane of my life, which had, led up to so fair a garden. And one thing above all kept turning and, turning in my head, until I thought I should die of waiting for its, fulfilment. Now was I free to ask Dorothy to marry me, to promise her, the ease and comfort that had once been hers, should God bring us safe, back to Maryland. The change in her was little less than a marvel to me\\n\\n\\\"'Ods! Blest if I know what he is,\\\" says Mr. Claude. \\\"He may be, anything, an impostor or a high-mightiness. But he's something to strike, the eye and hold it, for all his Quaker clothes. He is swarth and, thickset, and some five feet eight inches--full six inches under your, own height. And he comes asking for you as if you owned the town between, you. 'Send a fellow to Marlboro' Street for Mr. Richard Carvel, my good, host!' says he, with a snap of his fingers. And when I tell him the news, of you, he is prodigiously affected, and cries--but here's my gentleman, now!\\\"\\n\\nI arrived at Wye Island in season to dine with the good judge and his, family, and there I made over to his charge the property of Patty and her, mother. The afternoon we spent in sober talk, Mr. Bordley giving me much, sound advice, and writing me several letters of recommendation to, gentlemen in Congress. His conduct was distinguished by even more of, kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me.\\n\\n\\\"I could answer nothing. 'Twas because of her father's dying wish I, asked her, and she guessed that same. I would not tell her a lie, for, only the one woman lives whom I love, and whom I have loved ever since, we were children together among the strawberries. Need I say that that, woman is you, Dorothy? I loved you before we sailed to Carvel Hall, between my grandfather's knees, and I will love you till death claims, me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he followed Mrs. Manners out of the room, frowning and shaking his, fist at me in mock fierceness. I would have died for the man. For a, space--a prodigious long space--I lay very still, my heart bumping like a, gun-carriage broke loose, and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door., Then I caught the sound of a light footstep, the knob turned, and joy, poured into my soul with the sweep of a Fundy tide.\\n\\nOur men raised a hoarse yell, drowned all at once by the popping of, musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about, the decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to, larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the, space between the ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports., And next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them, muzzle to muzzle below, our rammers leaning into the Serapis to send, their shot home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us, in moments of suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce, to leap a cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the, English guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign\\n\\nwhich I saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort. And I, was made to take a spoonful of something. Never, I believe, was medicine, swallowed with a greater willingness. Talk was impossible, so I lay back, in the corner and looked at her; and now and anon she would glance at my, face, with a troubled guess in her own as to how I might stand the night., For we were still in London. That I knew by the trot of our horses, and, by the granite we traversed from time to time. But at length we rumbled, over a bridge, there was a sharp call back from our post-boy to him of, the chaise behind, and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying, and creaking, which was to last the whole night long, save for the brief, stops at the post-houses.\\n\\nThe rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme, Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck. Less than three score, of the seamen were American born; near four score were British, inclusive, of sixteen Irish; one hundred and thirty-seven were French soldiers, who, acted as marines; and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight, her were from all over the earth,--Malays and Maltese and Portuguese., In the hold were more than one hundred and fifty English prisoners.\\n\\ntoo, for now am I known from Mary-le-bone to Chelsea, while before my, name was unheard of out of little Mayfair. Indeed, I would not have, missed the experience for a lady-in-waiting-ship. I have learned a deal, since I saw you last, sir. I know that the world, like our Continental, money, must not be taken for the price that is stamped upon it. And as, for the watching with you,\\\" said my lady, \\\"that had to be borne with as, cheerfully as might be. Since I had sent off for you, I was in duty, bound to do my share toward your recovery. I was even going to add, that this watching was a pleasure,--our curate says the sense of duty, performed is sure to be. But you used to cry out the most terrifying, things to frighten me: the pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies, on the decks, and the black rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never, stopped; and strange, rough commands I could not understand; and the name, of your commodore whom you love so much. And often you would repeat over, and over: 'I have not yet begun, to fight, I have not yet begun to, fight!'\\\"\\n\\nThen there was the bed-canopy, the pleatings of which were gone, and it, was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That, was unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the, mantel was now but a bit of a shelf, and held many things that seemed, scarce at home on the rough and painted wood,--gold filigree; and China, and Japan, and a French clock that ought not to have been just there., Ah, the teacups! Here at last was something to touch a fibre of my, brain, but a pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back, to my grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as, Scipio's, and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too, large for him. And he was sewing. This was monstrous!\\n\\nI turned and followed him aft to the taffrail, where we were clear of the, French soldiers. The sun was hanging red over the Yorkshire Wolds, the, Head of Flamborough was in the blue shadow, and the clouds were like rose, leaves in the sky. The enemy had tacked and was standing west, with, ensign and jack and pennant flying, the level light washing his sails to, the whiteness of paper. 'Twas then I first remarked that the Alliance, had left her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the, Serapis. The commodore seemed to read my exclamation.\\n\\nI turned my face to the wall, completely overcome, and the tears scalding, in my eyes, at the thought of Dorothy and her mother bending over the, stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood, and watching at my bedside, night and day despite their weariness of body. And not a word out of, these noble women of their sacrifice, nor of the shame and trouble and, labour of their lives, who always had been used to every luxury! Nothing, but cheer had they brought to the sickroom, and not a sign of their, poverty and hardship, for they knew that their broths and biscuit and, jellies must have choked me. No. It remained for this contemptible, cur of a husband and father to open my eyes.\\n\\nstriking everywhere, sometimes sending casks of salt water over the, nettings. Incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering, sand over the black pools that kept running, running together as the, minutes were tolled out, and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces, in a hideous contortion. One little fellow, with whom I had had many a, lively word at mess, had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went, skipping past me with the charge under his coat, and I have but to listen, now to hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him, away to the cockpit below. Out of the main hatch, from that charnel, house, rose one continuous cry. It was an odd trick of the mind or soul, that put a hymn on my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human, misery, when men were calling the name of their Maker in vain. But as, I ran from crew to crew, I sang over and over again a long-forgotten, Christmas carol, and with it came a fleeting memory of my mother on the, stairs at Carvel Hall, and of the negroes gathered on the lawn without.\\n\\nI knew full well she meant it, and the terror of losing her kept me, silent. She put down the cup, placed another pillow behind my head with, a marvellous deftness, and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls, something which was surely nectar. And mine eyes, too, had their feast., Never before had I seen my lady in this gentle guise, this task of, nursing the sick, which her doing raised to a queenly art.\\n\\nSo passed that winter, the darkest of my life. One soft spring day, when, the birds were twittering amid new-born leaves, and the hyacinths and, tulips in Patty's garden were coming to their glory, Master Tom rode, leisurely down the drive at Gordon's Pride. That was a Saturday, the, 29th of April, 1775. The news which had flown southward, night and day, alike, was in no hurry to run off his tongue; he had been lolling on the, porch for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the, minute-men of Massachusetts and the British regulars, of the rout of, Percy's panting redcoats from Concord to Boston. Tom added, with the, brutal nonchalance which characterized his dealings with his mother and, sister, that he was on his way to Philadelphia to join a company.\\n\\nThe next morning, after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me, to his heart's content, enters Mr. Marmaduke Manners. I was prodigiously, struck by the change in him, and pitied him then near as much as I had, once despised him. He was arrayed in finery, as of old. But the finery, was some thing shabby; the lace was frayed at the edges, there was a neat, but obvious patch in his small-clothes, and two more in his coat. His, air was what distressed me most of all, being that of a man who spends, his days seeking favours and getting none. I had seen too many of the, type not to know the sign of it.\\n\\nto put in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once, visited. And how much of that money do you suppose I get, sir? Will you, believe it that I--\\\" (he was shrieking now), \\\"that I, the man of the, family, am allowed only my simple meals, a farthing for snuff, and not a, groat for chaise-hire? At my age I am obliged to walk to and from their, lordships' side entrances in patched clothes, egad, when a new suit might, obtain us a handsome year's income!\\\"\\n\\nWe were married on the fifteenth of June, already an anniversary for us, both, in the long drawing-room. General Clapsaddle was there from the, army to take Dorothy in his arms, even as he had embraced another bride, on the same spot in years gone by. She wore the wedding gown that was, her mother's, but when the hour was come to dress her Aunt Lucy and Aunt, Hester failed in their task, and it was Patty who performed the most of, that office, and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck.\\n\\nAt that the commodore hurried forward, the men falling back to the, bulwarks respectfully, and he mounted the fore-rigging as agile as any, topman, followed by his aide with a glass. From the masthead he sung out, to me to set our stu'nsails, and he remained aloft till near seven bells, of the watch. At that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety, behind the head, and from the deck a great yellow King's frigate could be, plainly seen standing south to meet us, followed by her smaller consort., Presently she hove to, and through our glasses we discerned a small boat, making for her side, and then a man clambering up her sea-ladder.\\n\\nIt makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that, tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the, King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that, stood so straight upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love, and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns, piped and sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the, long roll and the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive., Breechings were loosed and gun-tackles unlashed, rammer and sponge laid, out, and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy, when the time came to rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled, over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and, canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers, rigged the splinter nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes, against those that were sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of, water to put out the fires. Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is, slippery upon the boards. The French marines, their scarlet and white, very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were, mustered on poop and forecastle, and some were sent aloft to the tops to, assist the tars there to sweep the British decks with handgrenade and, musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and, steerage, to make ready for the grimmest work of all.\\n\\nI rushed back to my guns, for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of, the Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into, play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside, into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching, together, the disordered riggings locking, and both pointed northward to, a leeward tide in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to, shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.\\n\\n\\\"The duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to London., I think my father wrote of that to Dr. Courtenay.\\\" (I smiled at the, recollection, now.) \\\"Then his Grace persisted in following me, everywhere, and vowed publicly that he would marry me. I ordered him, from our house, since my father would not. At last one afternoon he came, back to dine with us, insolent to excess. I left the table. He sat with, my father two hours or more, drinking and singing, and giving orders to, the servants. I shut my door, that I might not hear. After a while my, mother came up to me, crying, saying that Mr. Manners would be branded, with dishonour and I did not consent to marry his Grace,--a most terrible, dishonour, of which she could not speak. That the duke had given my, father a month to win my consent. And that month was up, Richard, the, very afternoon you appeared with Mr. Dix in Arlington Street.\\\"\\n\\ninstead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and, prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen, gibberish of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the, first fury of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn, at the main hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had, burst, killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them., At this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches.\\n\\nbe accused of mercenary motives. The ragged crew of the Ranger was paid, in part out of his own pocket, and for a whole month he supported the, Drake's officers and men, no provision having been made for prisoners., He was at large expense in fitting out the Ranger, and he bought back at, twice what it was worth the plate taken from St. Mary's Isle, getting but, a tardy recognition from the Earl of Selkirk for such a noble and, unheard-of action. And, I take pride in writing it, Mr. Carvel spent, much of what he had earned at Gordon's Pride in a like honourable manner.\\n\\n\\\"Richard,\\\" replied he, with an ineffable sadness, \\\"I am naught but a, wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,--no, real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom, I lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life, I must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I know that, now, and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently, broken forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a wild young creature then, my dear, with little beside vanity, under my cap. And the notion that you could admire and love any girl but, me was beyond endurance. Then his Lordship arrived in England, brimming, with praise of you, to assure me that the affair was not about Patty at, all. This was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love, with her, and I may say now that I was miserable. Then, as we were, setting out for Castle Howard, came the news of your death on the road, to Upper Marlboro. I could not go a step. Poor Jack, he was very honest, when he proposed,\\\" she added, with a sigh.\\n\\nIt was Aunt Lucy who spent the morning with me, and Mrs. Manners brought, my dinner. I observed a questioning glance as she entered, which I took, for an attempt to read whether Mr. Marmaduke had spoke more than he, ought. But I would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my, discoveries, though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern., She stayed to talk on the progress of the war, relating the gallant, storming of Stony Point by Mad Anthony in July, and the latest Tory, insurrection on our own Eastern Shore. She passed from these matters to, a discussion of General Washington's new policy of the defensive, for, Mrs. Manners had always been at heart a patriot. And whilst I lay, listening with a deep interest, in comes my lady herself. So was it, ever, when you least expected her, even as Mammy had said. She curtseyed, very prettily, with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red, and asked me, how I did.\\n\\nRichard. You must have seen even then that I loved you, dear, though, I was so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his Grace. I could not, bear to think that you knew of any stain upon our family. I think--I, think I would rather have died, or have married him. That day I threw, Chartersea's presents out of the window, but my father made the servants, gather them all which escaped breaking, and put them in the drawing-room., Then I fell ill.\\\"\\n\\nAfter an hour of it, I was holding my breath against the lurches, like a, sea-sick man against that bottomless fall of the ship's bows on the, ocean. I had no pain,--only an over whelming exhaustion,--but the joy, of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy, dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary, twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning, ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic; or, reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of, that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous, of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort\\n\\nhis successful elusions of the 'Cerberus', which hounded him, and his, escape from the 'Solebay', are too famous to be dwelt upon here., Obtaining the Alfred, he captured and brought into Boston ten thousand, suits of uniform for Washington's shivering army. Then, by the bungling, of Congress, thirteen officers were promoted over his head. The, bitterness this act engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for, distinction was as great as Captain Jones's may be imagined. To his, everlasting credit be it recorded that he remained true to the country to, which he had dedicated his life and his talents. And it was not until, 1781 that he got the justice due him.\\n\\nWe had now but one of our starboard nine-pounders on its carriage, and, word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to, scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, we did, not have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away, for, the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy', from her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the, bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of, sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and, shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull\\n\\nTo us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay., Seven times, I say, was that battle lost, and seven times regained again., What was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their, posts through that hell of flame and shot, when a madman could scarce, have hoped for victory? What but the knowledge that somewhere in the, swirl above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept, all obstacles from before him, and into whose mind the thought of defeat, could not enter. His spirit held us to our task, for flesh and blood, might not have endured alone.\\n\\nand bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet, were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound, her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the, while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew, around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress, for the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her, muff and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs, of failure.\\n\\n\\\"I would never meet it, sir,\\\" he replied instantly. \\\"That would be the, height of folly. I would divide our forces into small, swift-sailing, squadrons, of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers. And I would, carry the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade. I can name, a score of such defenceless places, and I know every shoal of their, harbours. For example, Whitehaven might be entered. That is a town of, fifty thousand inhabitants. The fleet of merchantmen might with the, greatest ease be destroyed, a contribution levied, and Ireland's coal cut, off for a winter. The whole of the shipping might be swept out of the, Clyde. Newcastle is another likely place, and in almost any of the Irish, ports valuable vessels may be found. The Baltic and West Indian fleets, are to be intercepted. I have reflected upon these matters for years\\n\\nwhatever the pain they give. And my heart aches now when I think of that, dark day in Arlington Street when I gave you the locket, and you went out, of my life. I knew that I had done wrong then, Richard, as soon as ever, the door closed behind you. I should have gone with you, for better for, worse, for richer for poorer. I should have run after you in the rain, and thrown myself at your feet. And that would have been best for my, father and for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe Serapis, too, was now beginning to blaze aloft, and choking, wood-smoke eddied out of the Richard's hold and mingled with the powder, fumes. Then the enemy's fire abreast us seemed to lull, and Mr. Stacey, mounted the bulwarks, and cried out: \\\"You have cleared their decks, my, hearties!\\\" Aloft, a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the, very top of the Englishman, where he threw a hand-grenade, as I thought\\n\\nthat this was the man of whose innermost life I had had so intimate a, view. Who had taken me to the humble cottage under Criffel, who had, poured into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together, in the dingy room of the Castle Yard sponging-house. Then some of those, ludicrous scenes on the road to London came up to me, for which the, sky-blue frock was responsible. And yet this commodore was not greatly, removed from him I had first beheld on the brigantine John. His, confidence in his future had not so much as wavered since that day. That, future was now not so far distant as the horizon, and he was ready to, meet it.\\n\\nmerciful or cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act, of coolness and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a, gunner called for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch, the rammer from Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot, through his chest. Poor Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work, 'Scolding Sairy' was to do that night. I had but dragged him beyond, reach of the recoil when he was gone.\\n\\n\\\"To speak truth, I am heartily tired of that life,\\\" said he. \\\"There is, little glory in raising nicotia, and sipping bumbo, and cursing negroes., Ho for the sea!\\\" he cried. \\\"The salt sea, and the British prizes. Give, me a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake. Mark me, Richard,\\\" he, said, a restless gleam coning into his dark eyes, \\\"stirring times are, here, and a chance for all of us to make a name.\\\" For so it seemed ever, to be with him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I am speaking the truth,\\\" he said bitterly. \\\"And I assume no virtue, for the little justice it remains in my power to do. It is the lot of my, life that I must be false to some one always, and even now I am false to, your uncle. Yes, I am come to do justice, and 'tis a strange errand for, me. I know that estates have been restored to you by the Maryland, Legislature, Richard, and I believe in my heart that you will win this, war.\\\" Here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket. \\\"But to make you, secure,\\\" said he, \\\"in the year 1710, and on the 9th of March, old style\\n\\n\\\"I do not tell you that I shall change my life, Richard, for I have said, that too many times before. Indeed, I warn you that any money you may, send will be spent in drink, and--and worse. I will be no hypocrite to, you. But I believe that I am better this hour than I have been since, last I knelt at my mother's knee in the little Oxfordshire cottage where, I was born.\\\"\\n\\nDazed, I put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet. When I, had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for the very notion of, that cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in, his own temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that, panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the, ring-bolts of its companion that lay shattered there. \\\"Serve her with, double-headed, my lads,\\\" he shouted, \\\"and every shot into the, Englishman's mainmast!\\\"\\n\\nand set off at the devil's pace for the Texel. You must know that the, whole Dutch nation was in an uproar--as much of an uproar as those boors, ever reach--over the arrival of your infamous squadron. The Court Party, and our ambassador were for having you kicked out, and the Republicans, for making you at home. I heard that their High Mightinesses had given, Paul Jones the use of the Texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners\\n\\nNot until October of that year, 1775, was the infant navy born. Mr., Carvel was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical, seamanship and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of, instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon, the character of that hero by the fact that, with all his supreme, confidence in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first, lieutenancy. This was in deference to the older men before that body., \\\"I hoped,\\\" said he, \\\"in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from, those of more experience than myself.\\\" His lack of assertion for once, cost him dear. He sailed on the New Providence expedition under, Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon, discovered that, instead of gaining information, he was obliged to inform, others. He trained the men so thoroughly in the use of the great guns, \\\"that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as, soldiers generally perform the manual exercise.\\\"\\n\\nwhen I remembered the wilful miss who had come to London bent upon, pleasure alone. Truly, she was of that rare metal which refines, and, then outshines all others. And there was much I could not understand., A miracle had saved her from the Duke of Chartersea, but why she had, refused so many great men and good was beyond my comprehension. Not a, glimpse of her did I get that day, though my eyes wandered little from, the knob of the door. And even from Aunt Lucy no satisfaction was to be, had as to the cause of her absence.\\n\\n'Twas at this critical moment, when that fearful battle once more was, won, another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads, and that, name which we dreaded most of all was spread again. As we halted in, consternation, a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side, and, a babel of voices hailed the treacherous Landais with oaths and, imprecations. We made out the Alliance with a full head of canvas, black, and sharp, between us and the moon. Smoke hung above her rail. Getting, over against the signal fires blazing on Flamborough Head, she wore ship, and stood across our bows, the midshipman on the forecastle singing out, to her, by the commodore's orders, to lay the enemy by the board. There, was no response.\\n\\nI hurried over to the tea-cups, such a twinge did that discovery give me., But they troubled me near as much, and the sea-coal fire held strange, images. The fascination in the window was not to be denied, for it stood, in line with the houses and the trees. Suddenly there rose up before me, a gate. Yes, I knew that gate, and the girlish figure leaning over it., They were in Prince George Street. Behind them was a mass of golden-rose, bushes, and out of these came forth a black face under a turban, saying\\n\\n\\\"Ay, that he is, with our English cruisers thick as gulls outside', waiting for a dead fish. But he has spurned the French commission they, have offered him, saying that of the Congress is good enough for him., And he declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the, Alliance under the Stars and Stripes. And for this I honour him,\\\" added, he, \\\"and Charles honours him, and so must all Englishmen honour him when, they come to their senses. And by Gads life, I believe he will get, clear, for he is a marvel at seamanship.\\\"\\n\\nand worn themselves out with nursing me. Nor did I forget the risk they, ran with such a guest. For the first time in many years my heart, relented toward Mr. Marmaduke. For their sakes I forgave him over and, over what I had suffered, and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon, me. And how was I to repay them? They needed the money I had cost them\",\n          \", [This is the last letter which I was destined to receive from my poor, friend. He started to spend the Christmas of that year (1884) with his, people, and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident, at Sittingfleet, where the express ran into a freight train which was, standing in the depot. Dr. and Mrs. Munro were the only occupants of, the car next the locomotive, and were killed instantly, as were the, brakesman and one other passenger. It was such an end as both he and, his wife would have chosen; and no one who knew them would regret that, neither was left to mourn the other. His insurance policy of eleven, hundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own, family, which, as his father was sick, was the one worldly matter which, could have caused him concern.--H. S.]\\n\\nI told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious, return from Lochtully Castle. When I had settled for the flannel vests, which my mother had ordered so lavishly I had only five pounds left out, of my pay. With this, as it was the first money that I had ever earned, im{sic} my life, I bought her a gold bangle, so behold me reduced at, once to my usual empty pocketed condition. Well, it was something just, to feel that I HAD earned money. It gave me an assurance that I might, again.\\n\\nGood-bye, old chap, and never think that I forget you. Your letters are, read and re-read with avidity. I think I have every line you ever wrote, me. You simply knock Paley out every time. I am so glad that you got out, of that brewery business all right. For a time I was really afraid that, you must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares. I can, only thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques.\\n\\n\\\"A million pounds. Not a penny under. And dirt cheap to the nation that, buys it. I shall let it go at that, though I could make ten times as, much if I held on. I shall take it up to the Secretary of the Navy in, a week or two; and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person I, shall do business with him. It's not every day, Munro, that a man comes, into his office with the Atlantic under one arm and the Pacific under, the other. Eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nSince I am upon this topic, may I say just a little more without boring, you? You say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive, and that, I have nothing to offer in place of what I pull down. This is not quite, correct. I think that there are certain elemental truths within our, grasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance, and which are, sufficient to furnish us with a practical religion, having so much of, reason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold, not drive, them forth from it.\\n\\nfrom all I can learn of him, has suddenly swung clean over from one, extreme of character to the other. Every plus has in an instant become a, minus. He's another man, but in the same case. I am told that he used, to be (only a few months ago, mind you) most fastidious in dress, and speech. Now he is a foul-tongued rough! He had a nice taste in, literature. Now he stares at you if you speak of Shakespeare. Queerest, of all, he used to be a very high-and-dry Tory in his opinions. He, is fond now of airing the most democratic views, and in a needlessly, offensive way. When I did get on terms with him at last, I found that, there was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on, politics. In substance, I am bound to say that I think his new views are, probably saner than his old ones, but the insanity lies in his sudden, reasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech.\\n\\nYou know that you are turning up your nose at me, Bertie. I can see you, do it. But I'll come off the thin ice, and you shall have nothing but, facts now. I'm afraid that I should never do for a story-teller, for the, first stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me, off, with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me.\\n\\nYou'll laugh, Bertie, but it was no laughing matter to me. He wanted, eight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either, had or had not done. Otherwise the company would remove the gas-meter., How little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting, to me was either to pay away more than half my capital, or to give up, cooking my food! I at last appeased him by a promise that I should look, into the matter, and so escaped for the moment, badly shaken but still, solvent. He gave me a good deal of information about the state of his, tubes (his own, not the gas company's) before he departed; but I had, rather lost interest in the subject since I had learned that he was, being treated by his club doctor.\\n\\nWho do you think was the first person who broke this spell of, silence? The ruffian whom I had fought under the lamp-post. He is a, scissors-grinder it seems, and rang to know if I had a job for him. I, could not help grinning at him when I opened the door and saw who it, was. He showed no sign of recognising me, however, which is hardly to be, wondered at.\\n\\nthat years ago the name of Bradfield used to strike with a causeless, familiarity upon my ear; and since then, as you know, the course of my, life has flowed through it. And so when I first saw Winnie La Force in, the railway carriage, before I had spoken to her or knew her name, I, felt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her. Have you had, no experience of the sort in your life? Or was it merely that she was, obviously gentle and retiring, and so made a silent claim upon all that, was helpful and manly in me? At any rate, I was conscious of it; and, again and again every time that I met her. How good is that saying of, some Russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole, sex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand! I thought I, knew something of women. I suppose every medical student does. But now I, can see that I really knew nothing. My knowledge was all external. I did, not know the woman soul, that crowning gift of Providence to man, which\\n\\nshe runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a, household word, and they all pretend to sympathise with her, and, agree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man. I, quarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct, and it ended, by my throwing him down the stairs. What was the result? He talked so, much about it that the whole village from which he came, sick and, well, trooped to see me. The little country practitioner who had been, buttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well, put up his shutters. It's human nature, my boy, and you can't alter it., Eh, what? You make yourself cheap and you become cheap. You put a high, price on yourself and they rate you at that price. Suppose I set up in, Harley Street to-morrow, and made it all nice and easy, with hours from, ten to three, do you think I should get a patient? I might starve first., How would I work it? I should let it be known that I only saw patients, from midnight until two in the morning, and that bald-headed people, must pay double. That would set people talking, their curiosity would, be stimulated, and in four months the street would be blocked all night., Eh, what? laddie, you'd go yourself. That's my principle here. I often, come in of a morning and send them all about their business, tell them, I'm going off to the country for a day. I turn away forty pounds, and, it's worth four hundred as an advertisement!\\\"\\n\\nWell, this made me sit down and gasp. I am, I think, one of the most, unsuspicious men upon earth, and through a certain easy-going indolence, of disposition I never even think of the possibility of those with whom, I am brought in contact trying to deceive me. It does not occur to me., But let me once get on that line of thought--let me have proof that, there is reason for suspicion--and then all faith slips completely away, from me. Now I could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at, Bradfield. Those sudden fits of ill temper, the occasional ill-concealed, animosity of Cullingworth--did they not mark the arrival of each of, my mother's letters? I was convinced that they did. He had read them, then--read them from the pockets of the little house coat which I used, to leave carelessly in the hall when I put on my professional one to go, out. I could remember, for example, how at the end of his illness his, manner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my, mother's had arrived. Yes, it was certain that he had read them from the, beginning.\\n\\nThe time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this; but, we gradually whittled it down to five and to four. My income had risen, to about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time; and Winnie had, agreed, with a somewhat enigmatical smile, that we could manage very, well on that--the more so as marriage sends a doctor's income up. The, reason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that, date I received a most portentous blue document in which \\\"We, Brown, & Woodhouse, the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned, Winifred La Force, do hereby\\\"--state a surprising number of things\\n\\nNow about the Cullingworths. Madam is as amiable as ever; and yet, somehow, unless I am deceiving myself, she has changed somewhat of late, in her feelings towards me. I have turned upon her suddenly more than, once, and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than, malignant. In one or two small matters I have also detected a hardness, in her which I had never observed before. Is it that I have intruded, too much into their family life? Have I come between the husband and the, wife? Goodness knows I have striven with all my little stock of tact to, avoid doing so. And yet I have often felt that my position was a false, one. Perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a woman's, glances and gestures. He wishes to assign a definite meaning to each\\n\\nTo commence with what is of most moment, you may rest assured that what, you said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest, attention. I am sorry that I have not got it by me to refer to (I, lent it to Charlie), but I think I have the contents in my head. It is, notorious, as you say, that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of, the orthodox, and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to, dogma. Such men are the real enemies of free thought. If anything could, persuade me to turn traitor to my reason, it would, for example, be, the blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic, journals.\\n\\nI travelled down part of the way with young Leslie Duncan, whom I think, you know. He was gracious enough to consider that a third-class carriage, and my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude. You, know that he came into his uncle's money a little time ago, and after a, first delirious outbreak, he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state, of despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for., How absurd are the ambitions of life when I think that I, who am fairly, happy and as keen as a razor edge, should be struggling for that which, I can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him! And yet, if I, can read my own nature, it is not the accumulation of money which is my, real aim, but only that I may acquire so much as will relieve my mind, of sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which I may have\\n\\nwith the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character. Always, a lady, whether she was bargaining with the butcher, or breaking in a, skittish charwoman, or stirring the porridge, which I can see her doing, with the porridge-stick in one hand, and the other holding her Revue, des deux Mondes within two inches of her dear nose. That was always her, favourite reading, and I can never think of her without the association, of its browny-yellow cover.\\n\\nYou must know, then, that within the boundaries of this city there are, two ladies, a mother and a daughter, whom I shall call Mrs. and Miss, Laura Andrews. They are patients of the governor's, and have become, to some extent friends of the family. Madame is Welsh, charming, in appearance, dignified in her manners, and High Church in her, convictions. The daughter is rather taller than the mother, but, otherwise they are strikingly alike. The mother is thirty-six and, the daughter eighteen. Both are exceedingly charming. Had I to choose, between them, I think, entre nous, that the mother would have attracted, me most, for I am thoroughly of Balzac's opinion as to the woman of, thirty. However, fate was to will it otherwise.\\n\\nAfter all, I own to you, that it might have been better had I listened, to what he had to say, and refused to give my own views. On the other, hand, truth MUST be as broad as the universe which it is to explain, and, therefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive., A protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards, truth. Who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the Almighty? It would be, an insolence on the part of a solar system, and yet it is done every, day by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers. There lies the real, impiety.\\n\\nI read over what I have written, but I can see that I give you no real, insight into the demoniac cleverness of Cullingworth. His views upon, medicine were most revolutionary, but I daresay that if things fulfil, their promise I may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel., With his brilliant and unusual gifts, his fine athletic record, his, strange way of dressing (his hat on the back of his head and his throat, bare), his thundering voice, and his ugly, powerful face, he had quite, the most marked individuality of any man that I have ever known.\\n\\nI was compelled, by the way, to forego an opening which a few months ago, would have been the very summit of my ambition. You must know (possibly, I told you), that immediately after I passed, I put my name down as a, candidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship, lines. It was done as a forlorn hope, for a man has usually to wait, several years before his turn comes round. Well, just a week after I, started here, I got a telegram one night from Liverpool: \\\"Join the Decia, to-morrow as surgeon, not later than eight in the evening.\\\" It was from, Staunton & Merivale, the famous South American firm, and the Decia is, a fine 6000-ton passenger boat, doing the round journey by Bahia and, Buenos Ayres to Rio and Valparaiso. I had a bad quarter of an hour, I, can tell you. I don't think I was ever so undecided about anything in my, life. Cullingworth was dead against my going, and his influence carried, the day.\\n\\ntickled the child, and gained over the whole household. He had these, attacks periodically, and made an arrangement with me by which I was to, deal with him, and we were to balance bills against each other. It was, a ghoulish compact, by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to, me, while a spell of health for Haywood sent me back to dry bread and, saveloys. However, it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling, which must otherwise have gone in food. At last, however, the poor, fellow died, and there was our final settlement.\\n\\na selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her, attacks, insisting upon my carrying them away then and there; so that I, stagger out of the house like one of Napoleon's generals coming out of, Italy. There is a good deal of method in the old lady, however, and on, her recovery she invariably sends round a porter, with a polite note to, say that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again.\\n\\nthinking that it was an accident, but an instant afterwards I received, another and a harder one. I dropped my paper with a growl, but the, moment that I glanced at him I saw how the matter stood. His foot was, jerking spasmodically, his two hands clenched, and drumming against his, breast, while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his, iris was to be seen. I sprang upon him, tore open his collar, unbuttoned, his waistcoat, and pulled his head down upon the seat. Crash went one of, his heels through the carriage window, but I contrived to sit upon his, knees while I kept hold of his two wrists.\\n\\nWell, I was averse from going myself, but Winnie was all for peace and, forgiveness. Women who claim nothing invariably get everything, and so, my gentle little wife always carries her point. Half an hour later I was, in Cadogan Terrace with very mixed feelings, but the kindlier ones at, the top. I tried to think that Cullingworth's treatment of me had been, pathological--the result of a diseased brain. If a delirious man had, struck me, I should not have been angry with him. That must be my way of, looking at it.\\n\\n\\\"You may label me as you like,\\\" I answered (and by this time I fear that, I had got my preaching stop fairly out); \\\"I don't pretend to know what, truth is, for it is infinite, and I finite; but I know particularly well, what it is NOT. It is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen, hundred years ago, and that we are for ever to refer back to what was, written and said in those days. No, sir; religion is a vital living, thing, still growing and working, capable of endless extension and, development, like all other fields of thought. There were many eternal, truths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book, some parts, of which may indeed be called holy. But there are others yet to be, revealed; and if we are to reject them because they are not in those, pages, we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice, of Kirschoff's spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in, Albertus Magnus. A modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write, to the magazines; but none the less he may be the little pipe which, conveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth. Look at this!\\\" I, cried, rising and reading my Carlyle text. \\\"That comes from no Hebrew, prophet, but from a ratepayer in Chelsea. He and Emerson are also among, the prophets. The Almighty has not said His last say to the human race\\n\\nAnd first of all, a thousand thanks for your two long letters, which lie, before me as I write. There is little enough personal news in them, but, I can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels, off very smoothly from week to week. On the other hand, you give me, plenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more, interesting. After all, we may very well agree to differ. You think, some things are proved which I don't believe in. You think some things, edifying which do not appear to me to be so. Well, I know that you are, perfectly honest in your belief. I am sure you give me credit for being, the same. The future wilt decide which of us is right. The survival of, the truest is a constant law, I fancy, though it must be acknowledged, that it is very slow in action.\\n\\n\\\"Too provincial, my boy! What's the good of a village practice with, a miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to, spread? My head was sticking out at one end of Bradfield and my feet at, the other. Why, there wasn't room for Hetty in the place, let alone, me! I've taken to the eye, my boy. There's a fortune in the eye. A man, grudges a half-crown to cure his chest or his throat, but he'd spend his, last dollar over his eye. There's money in ears, but the eye is a gold, mine.\\\"\\n\\nshoved them against the wall, and occasionally rushed out to the head, of the stair to address them en masse. At the same time, behind all, this tomfoolery, I, watching his prescriptions, could see a quickness of, diagnosis, a scientific insight, and a daring and unconventional use of, drugs, which satisfied me that he was right in saying that, under all, this charlatanism, there lay solid reasons for his success. Indeed\\n\\nIt was some weeks, however, before I gained his confidence, so far as, to be able to hold a real conversation with him. For a long time he was, very sullen and suspicious, resenting the constant watch which I kept, upon him. This could not be relaxed, for he was full of the most apish, tricks. One day he got hold of my tobacco pouch, and stuffed two ounces, of my tobacco into the long barrel of an Eastern gun which hangs on the, wall. He jammed it all down with the ramrod, and I was never able to get, it up again. Another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the, window, and would have sent the clock after it had I not prevented, him. Every day I took him for a two hours' constitutional, save when it, rained, and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down, the room. Heh! but it was a deadly, dreary, kind of life.\\n\\nThis took some thinking out. It had an ugly sound, but I gathered that, she meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since, these gentlemen were satisfied. So the bargain was struck, and I ordered, tea to be ready in an hour, while I went back to the station to fetch up, my luggage. A porter brought it up for eightpence (saving fourpence on, a cab, my boy!) and so I found myself in the heart of Birchespool with, a base of operations secured. I looked out of the little window of my, lodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs, with a spire or, two spurting up among them, and I shook my teaspoon defiantly at them., \\\"You've got to conquer me,\\\" said I, \\\"or else I'm man enough to conquer, you.\\\"\\n\\nSo, after much argument, it ended in the kind fellow going off and, leaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table. The money, burned my fingers, for I knew that his pension was not a very large one;, and yet, since I could not avoid taking it, there was no denying that it, was exceedingly useful. Out I sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it, upon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my, bed. Already, you see, I was getting to a state of enervating luxury, in my household arrangements, and I could only lull my conscience by, reminding myself that little Paul would have to sleep with me when he, came.\\n\\nor else may be taken as marking the tombs of Anglican chiefs, the, lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping. This had been explained, by the Patagonian school as being a universal system of, lightning-conductors. He (the lecturer) could not assent to this theory., In a series of observations, extending over several months, he had, discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing, if followed, out, invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were, connected with furnaces. No one who knew how addicted the ancient, Britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant., Evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central, chamber, and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the, tubes to the house of every citizen, so that he might inhale it at will., Having illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams, the lecturer, concluded by saying that, although true science was invariably cautious, and undogmatic, it was none the less an incontestable fact that so, much light had been thrown upon old London, that every action of the, citizens' daily life was known, from the taking of a tub in the morning\\n\\nnow that I come to think of it, I have never enjoyed very much of your, confidence in return. But that may be my fault. Perhaps you don't find, me sympathetic, even though I have every wish to be. I can only say that, I find you intensely so, and perhaps I presume too much upon the fact., But no, every instinct in my nature tells me that I don't bore you by my, confidences.\\n\\nAnd all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news. It is, that I had a telegram from Cullingworth this morning--after nine months', silence. It was dated from Avonmouth, the town where I had suspected, that he had settled, and it said simply, \\\"Come at once. I have urgent, need of you. CULLINGWORTH.\\\" Of course, I shall go by the first train, to-morrow. It may mean anything or nothing. In my heart of hearts I hope, and believe that old Cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his, partner or in some other way. I always believed that he would turn up, trumps, and make my fortune as well as his own. He knows that if I am, not very quick or brilliant I am fairly steady and reliable. So that's, what I've been working up to all along, Bertie, that to-morrow I go to, join Cullingworth, and that it looks as if there was to be an opening, for me at last. I gave you a sketch of him and his ways, so that you may, take an interest in the development of my fortune, which you could not, do if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand, to me.\\n\\n, Do you think that such a thing as chance exists? Rather an explosive, sentence to start a letter with; but pray cast your mind back over your, own life, and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of, chance. You know how often the turning down this street or that, the, accepting or rejecting of an invitation, may deflect the whole current, of our lives into some other channel. Are we mere leaves, fluttered, hither and thither by the wind, or are we rather, with every conviction, that we are free agents, carried steadily along to a definite and, pre-determined end? I confess that as I advance through life, I become, more and more confirmed in that fatalism to which I have always had an, inclination.\\n\\nWell, I made the most dreadful fool of myself. At first, the good lady, who (as I think I told you) is very dignified and rather reserved, could, not believe her senses. Then, as the full force of my enormity came upon, her she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest, woman I had ever seen. It was an interview with a refrigerator. She, asked me what I had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged, me to subject her to such an outrage. I saw, of course, that any excuses, upon my part would put her on the right track and give poor Laura away;, so I stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand, presenting\\n\\nand two layers of them squatting in the cellar? Well, that's my house of, business on an average day. The folk come in from the county fifty miles, off, and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep, so as to be first in, when the housekeeper comes down. The medical officer of health made an, official complaint of the over-crowding of my waiting-rooms. They wait, in the stables, and sit along the racks and under the horses' bellies., I'll turn some of 'em on to you, my boy, and then you'll know a little, more about it.\\\"\\n\\nI walked down to the Park, which is the chief centre of the place, and I, found that I liked everything I saw of it. It was a lovely evening, and, the air was fresh and sweet. I sat down and listened to the band for an, hour, watching all the family parties, and feeling particularly lonely., Music nearly always puts me into the minor key; so there came a time, when I could stand it no longer, and I set off to find my way back to my, lodgings. On the whole, I felt that Birchespool was a place in which a, man might very well spend a happy life.\\n\\n\\\"The best dispenser in the world!\\\" cried Cullingworth, patting her on, the shoulder. \\\"You see how I do it, Munro. I write on a label what the, prescription is, and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged., The man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon, hole. Hetty makes it up, passes out the bottle, and takes the money., Now, come on and clear some of these folk out of the house.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Williams and I stood for five minutes without a word, hushed by the, presence of that supreme fact. Then we laid him straight, and drew the, sheet over him. She knelt down and prayed and sobbed, while I sat on, the bed, with the cold hand in mine. Then my heart turned to lead as I, remembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the, moral principles of right and wrong. But when you look closely it is a, question whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not, prove to have been a right to the interests of posterity. That sounds, a little foggy; but I will make my meaning more clear when I say that, I think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those, great hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe, that both, are making for improvement; but that the action of the one is immediate\\n\\nso they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks. They have the, most singular notions about medicines. \\\"It's that strong that a spoon, will stand oop in't!\\\" is one man's description. Above all, they love to, have two bottles, one with a solution of citric acid, and the other with, carbonate of soda. When the mixture begins to fizz, they realise that, there is indeed a science of medicine.\\n\\n\\\"Deuced interesting thing, Munro,\\\" said he. \\\"Come and look at this, temperature chart. I've been taking it every quarter of an hour since I, couldn't sleep, and it's up and down till it looks like the mountains in, the geography books. We'll have some drugs in--eh, what, Munro?--and by, Crums, we'll revolutionise all their ideas about fevers. I'll write a, pamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean, out of date, and they'll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And there is one more thing, Mr. Detective, sir,\\\" said Whitehall, explosively. \\\"I'm not a rich man, sir, only the ---- half-pay skipper, of an armed transport; but by ----, sir, I'd give you this hat full of, dollars to know the name of the ---- rascal who wrote that anonymous, letter, sir. By ---- sir, you'd have a real case to look after then.\\\", And he waved his black thorn ferociously.\\n\\nWell, I sat down there and brooded. In my heart I did not believe that, Cullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease. That could not, have been his real reason for driving me from the practice. He had found, me in the way in his domestic life, no doubt, and he had devised, this excuse for getting rid of me. Whatever the reason was, it was, sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice\\n\\ninto forced smiles when I had asked him point blank what was the matter?, One obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without, telling also how he had acquired his information. But I knew enough of, Cullingworth's resource to feel that he could easily have got over such, a difficulty as that. In fact, in this last letter he HAD got over it, by his tale about the grate and the maid. He must have had some stronger, reason for restraint. As I thought over the course of our relations I, was convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until I had, committed myself, and then to abandon me, so that I should myself have, no resource but to compound with my creditors-to be, in fact, that which, my mother had called him.\\n\\nWisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme, of Nature. What proof do we want, then, from a book? If the man who, observes the myriad stars, and considers that they and their innumerable, satellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens, each, swinging clear of the other's orbit--if, I say, the man who sees this, cannot realise the Creator's attributes without the help of the book of, Job, then his view of things is beyond my understanding. Nor is it only, in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some, intelligent force. Nothing is too tiny for that fostering care. We see, the minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the, calyx of the flower, the most microscopic hair and gland each with its, definite purposeful function to perform. What matter whether these came, by special creation or by evolution? We know as a matter of fact that, they came by evolution, but that only defines the law. It does not, explain it.\\n\\nWell, we all work back again by two o'clock, when we find dinner waiting, for us. We may or may not have finished our rounds. If not away we go, again. If we have, Horton dictates his prescriptions, and strides off, to bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth. He is the most abandoned, smoker I have ever met with, collecting the dottles of his pipes in, the evening, and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the, stable yard. When he has departed for his nap, McCarthy and I get to, work on the medicine. There are, perhaps, fifty bottles to put up, with, pills, ointment, etc. It is quite half-past four before we have them all, laid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids. Then we have, an hour or so of quiet, when we smoke or read, or box with the coachman, in the harness room. After tea the evening's work commences. From six to, nine people are coming in for their medicine, or fresh patients wishing, advice. When these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases, which may be on the list; and so, about ten o'clock, we may hope to have, another smoke, and perhaps a game of cards. Then it is a rare thing for, a night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a, case which may take us two hours, or may take us ten. Hard work, as you, see; but Horton is such a good chap, and works so hard himself, that one, does not mind what one does. And then we are all like brothers in the, house; our talk is just a rattle of chaff, and the patients are as, homely as ourselves, so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of, us.\\n\\nBut we were demoralised by luxury. We could no longer manage without a, helper--especially now in the winter time, when fires had to be lit--the, most heart-breaking task that a man can undertake. I bethought me of, the quiet Miss Williams, and hunted her up in her shop. She was quite, willing to come, and saw how she could get out of the rent; but the, difficulty lay with her stock. This sounded formidable at first, but, when I came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings, it, did not appear insurmountable. In half an hour my watch was pawned, and, the affair concluded. I returned with an excellent housekeeper, and, with a larger basketful of inferior Swedish matches, bootlaces, cakes of, black lead, and little figures made of sugar than I should have thought, it possible to get for the money. So now we have settled down, and I, hope that a period of comparative peace lies before us.\\n\\nI nearly snatched it out of his hands. Then away I ran to take, possession of my property. Never shall I forget my feelings, my dear, Bertie, when the key clicked in the lock, and the door flew open. It was, my own house--all my very own! I shut the door again, the noise of the, street died down, and I had, in that empty, dust-strewn hall, such a, sense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before. In all my life, it was the first time that I had ever stood upon boards which were not, paid for by another.\\n\\nAnd then as I walked back I considered how far I could avail myself of, this money from Cullingworth. It was not much, but it would be madness, to start without it, for I had sent home the little which I had saved at, Horton's. I had not more than six pounds in the whole world. I reflected, that the money could make no difference to Cullingworth, with his large, income, while it made a vast one to me. I should repay him in a year, or two at the latest. Perhaps I might get on so well as to be able to, dispense with it almost at once. There could be no doubt that it was the, representations of Cullingworth as to my future prospects in Bradfield, which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the Decia. I need, not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance, from his hands. On my return, I told him that I had decided to do so\\n\\nWhen the auction was over, I paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on, to a trolly, the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings., I found that I had over-estimated the cost of furnishing, for the total, expense was little more than three pounds. We walked round to Oakley, Villa, and I proudly deposited all my goods in the hall. And here came, another extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes. The, porter when I had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a, huge mat of oakum, as ugly a thing as I have ever set eyes upon. This he, laid down inside my door, and then without a word, brushing aside every, remonstrance or attempt at thanks, he vanished away with his trolly into, the night.\\n\\nfor a short spell I could manage to live on a couple of pence a day; but, what I am doing now is not to be a mere spurt, but my regular mode of, life for many a month to come. My tea and sugar and milk (Swiss), come collectively to one penny a day. The loaf is at twopence, three-farthings, and I consume one a day. My dinner consists in, rotation of one third of a pound of bacon, cooked over the gas (twopence, halfpenny), or two saveloys (twopence), or two pieces of fried, fish (twopence), or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of Chicago beef, (twopence). Any one of these, with a due allowance of bread and water\\n\\nBut once inside, there was so much to be done that I did not know what, I should turn to first. I bought a one-and-ninepenny broom and set to, work. You notice that I am precise about small sums, because just there, lies the whole key of the situation. In the yard I found a zinc pail, with a hole in it, which was most useful, for by its aid I managed to, carry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped. Then with my new, broom, my coat hung on a gas-bracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the, elbow, I cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall, brushing the refuse, into the yard. After that I did as much for the upper floor, with the, result that I brought several square yards of dust down into the hall, again, and undid my previous cleaning. This was disheartening, but at, least it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future. When I had, finished, I was as hot and dirty as if it were half-time at a football, match. I thought of our tidy charwoman at home, and realised what, splendid training she must be in.\\n\\nHis mind runs rather on naval architecture at present, and he has been, devising an ingenious method of preventing wooden-sided vessels from, being crippled by artillery fire. I did not think much of his magnetic, attractor, because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success, that he claimed for it, it would merely have the effect of substituting, some other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells. This new, project has, however, more to recommend it. This is the idea, as put in, his own words; and, as he has been speaking of little else for the last, two days, I ought to remember them.\\n\\nwhen we think of the more advanced type of young man, we picture him as, bald, and with double eye-glasses. I am an absolute animal myself, and, my only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going. On the, other hand, there is some evidence in favour of the development of a, sixth sense-that of perception. If I had it now I should know that you, are heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism.\\n\\nI confess that I have never been able to understand the position of the, atheist. In fact, I have come to disbelieve in his existence, and, to look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach. It may, represent a temporary condition, a passing mental phase, a defiant, reaction against an anthropomorphic ideal; but I cannot conceive that, any man can continue to survey Nature and to deny that there are laws at, work which display intelligence and power. The very existence of a world, carries with it the proof of a world-maker, as the table guarantees, the pre-existence of the carpenter. Granting this, one may form what, conception one will of that Maker, but one cannot be an atheist.\\n\\nwhich should keep parallel with his medical one, were for ever at an, end. On the whole, bearing in mind my mother's opposition, and the, continual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks, I was, not very sorry. On the contrary, a sudden curious little thrill of, happiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff, and, as a, drift of rooks passed cawing over my head, I began cawing also in the, overflow of my spirits.\\n\\nThe unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased, to deserve the name. You remember that in my last I had received my, dismissal, and was on the eve of starting for the little country town, of Stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there., Well, in the morning, before I came down to breakfast, I was putting one, or two things into a bag, when there came a timid knock at my door, and, there was Mrs. Cullingworth in her dressing-jacket, with her hair down, her back.\\n\\n\\\"You'll forgive me for saying, Dr. Munro, sir, that you are a ---- lucky, fellow,\\\" said he. \\\"You've put your hand in the bag, sir, and taken out, the eel first time, as any one with half an eye can see. Now, I've had, three dips, and landed a snake every dip. If I'd had a good woman at my, side, Dr. Munro, sir, I might not be the broken half-pay skipper of an, armed transport to-day.\\\"\\n\\nFred was a little better during the day, and even seemed in a dull, sort of way to recognise his sister, who brought him flowers in the, afternoon. Towards evening his temperature sank to 101.5@, and he, fell into a kind of stupor. As it happened, Dr. Porter came in about, supper-time, and I asked him if he would step up and have a look at my, patient. He did so, and we found him dozing peacefully. You would hardly, think that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous, in my life. It was the merest chance in the world that Porter went up at, all.\\n\\nthe coachman, Mrs. Cullingworth, and the coachman's wife. We dug, foundations, got bricks in by the cartload, made our own mortar, and I, think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it. It's not quite, as flat-chested as we could wish; and I think that if I were a horse, inside it, I should be careful about brushing against the walls;, but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished., Cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves; but as, we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing, need.\\n\\nOf course, I told him that his views were diabolical; but, especially, since that warning which I had from his wife, I discount everything, that he says. He begins in earnest; but as he goes on the humour of, exaggeration gets hold of him, and he winds up with things which he, would never uphold in cold blood. However, the fact remains that we, differ widely in our views of professional life, and I fear that we may, come to grief over the question.\\n\\nWell, there the matter might have ended; but about three days afterwards, who should be shown into my consulting room but Mrs. La Force and her, daughter. I thought the latter looked twice at me, when her mother, introduced her, as if she had some recollection of my face; but she, evidently could not recall where she had seen it, and I said nothing to, help her. They both seemed to be much distressed in mind--indeed\\n\\nInstead of \\\"pulling himself together,\\\" he very nearly knocked me, asunder. I was all abroad for an instant. He had turned on me like a, flash, and had struck me on the throat just under the chin, my head, being a little back at the moment. It made me swallow once or twice, I, can tell you. Sudden as the blow was, I had countered, in the automatic, sort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does. It was only, from the elbow, with no body behind it, but it served to stave him off, for the moment, while I was making inquiries about my windpipe. Then, in he came with a rush; and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of, delight, we were pushed, almost locked in each other's arms on to that, big pedestal of which I have spoken. \\\"Go it, little 'un!\\\" \\\"Give him, beans!\\\" yelled the mob, who had lost all sight of the origin of the, fray, and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter, man. So there, my dear Bertie, was I, within a few hours of my entrance, into this town, with my top-hat down to my ears, my highly professional, frock-coat, and my kid gloves, fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal, in one of the most public places, in the heart of a yelling and hostile, mob! I ask you whether that was cruel luck or not?\\n\\nas far as I have ever been able to observe it, has been that it allows, the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other, men could only reach by hard work. In this sense Cullingworth was the, greatest genius that I have ever known. He never seemed to work, and yet, he took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the ten-hour-a-day, men. That might not count for much, for he was quite capable of idling, ostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night; but, start a subject of your own for him, and then see his originality and, strength. Talk about torpedoes, and he would catch up a pencil, and on, the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some, novel contrivance for piercing a ship's netting and getting at her side\\n\\nI remember how struck I was when first I saw the actual cautery applied, in a case of spinal disease. The white hot iron was pressed firmly into, the patient's back, without the use of any anaesthetic, and what with, the sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh I felt faint and ill., Yet, to my astonishment, the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle, of his face, and on my inquiring afterwards, he assured me that the, proceeding was absolutely painless, a remark which was corroborated, by the surgeon. \\\"The nerves are so completely and instantaneously, destroyed,\\\" he explained, \\\"that they have no time to convey a painful, impression.\\\" But then if this be so, what becomes of all the martyrs, at the stake, and the victims of Red Indians, and other poor folk, over whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered? It may be that, Providence is not only not cruel itself, but will not allow man to be, cruel either. Do your worst, and it will step in with a \\\"No, I won't, allow this poor child of mine to be hurt\\\"; and then comes the dulling, of the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of, the tormentor. David Livingstone under the claws of the lion must have, looked like an object lesson of the evil side of things, and yet he has, left it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than, otherwise. I am well convinced that if the newly-born infant and the man, who had just died could compare their experiences, the former would have, proved to be the sufferer. It is not for nothing that the first thing, the newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and, protest energetically against fate.\\n\\nPerhaps it was too bad of me to say that. I might have guarded without, countering. Anyhow; it had the effect of ending an interview which was, becoming oppressive. My visitor was too indignant to answer, and swept, out of the room without a word. From my window I could see him hurry, down the street, a little black angry thing, very hot and troubled, because he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and, compasses.\\n\\nI face my study window as I write, Bertie. Slate-coloured clouds with, ragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead. Between them one has a, glimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray. I can hear the gentle swish, of the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller, among the leaves. Sometimes it falls straight and heavy, till the air is, full of the delicate gray shading, and for half a foot above the ground, there is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules. Then, without any change in the clouds it cases off again. Pools line my walk\\n\\nso I climbed out of bed, gathered a little heap of tobacco-dust from the, linings of my pocket, and smoked the whole thing over. That life-belt of, which I had spoken so confidingly had burst, and left me to kick as best, I might in very deep water. I read the note over and over again; and for, all my dilemma, I could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and, stupidity of the thing. The picture of the host and hostess busying, themselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest, struck me as one of the funniest things I could remember. And there, was the stupidity of it, because surely a child could have seen that my, mother's attack was in answer to my defence. Why should we write a duet, each saying the same thing? Well, I'm still very confused about it all\\n\\nand I knew that her mother's will was her law, and that her course, was already marked out for her. However, we exchanged our little, confidences, and met occasionally by appointment, and tried to make our, lives brighter without darkening those of any one else. I can see you, shake your head here and growl, like the comfortable married man that, you are, that such relations are very dangerous. So they are, my boy:, but neither of us cared, she out of innocence and I out of recklessness\\n\\n\\\"Your letter to hand. Why not call me a liar at once? I tell you that I, have seen thirty thousand patients in the last year. My actual takings, have been over four thousand pounds. All patients come to me. Would not, cross the street to see Queen Victoria. You can have all visiting, all, surgery, all midwifery. Make what you like of it. Will guarantee three, hundred pounds the first year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may knock,\\\" said he, when I began to percuss his chest, \\\"but I am, ---- sure there's no one at home. They've all gone visiting one another., Sir John Hutton had a try some years ago. 'Why, dammy, man, where's your, liver?' said he. 'Seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a, porridge stick,' said he. 'Nothing is in its right place.' 'Except, my heart, Sir John,' said I. 'Aye, by ----, that will never lose its, moorings while it has a flap left.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I have written to you about my practice, and I've wired to you, about it, and here you sit asking me if I work it in two rooms. I'll, have to hire the market square before I've finished, and then I won't, have space to wag my elbows. Can your imagination rise to a great house, with people waiting in every room, jammed in as tight as they'll fit\\n\\nWell, it ended by lord and lacquey moving off, and leaving me with my, patient. I thought that I should lose no time in establishing a kindly, relation with him, so I drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask, him a few questions about his health and habits. Not a word could I get, out of him in reply. He sat as sullen as a mule, with a kind of sneer, about his handsome face, which showed me very well that he had heard, everything. I tried this and tried that, but not a syllable could I, get from him; so at last I turned from him and began to look over some, illustrated papers on the table. He doesn't read, it seems, and will do, nothing but look at pictures. Well, I was sitting like this with my back, half turned, when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking, gently at me, and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into, my coat pocket. I caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round, but too, late to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind, the Hon. James Derwent, who sat grinning at me like a mischievous, monkey.\\n\\nif we do not ourselves degrade it, will set an edge to all that is good, in us. I did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a man's whole, life and every action with unselfishness. I did not know how easy it is, to be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be, so; or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes, instead of two. I had much to learn, you see; but I think I have learned, it.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Munro\\\" (this was the style of the thing), \\\"why was armour, abandoned, eh? What! I'll tell you why. It was because the weight of, metal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he, could carry. But battles are not fought now-a-days by men who are, standing up. Your infantry are all lying on their stomachs, and it would, take very little to protect them. And steel has improved, Munro! Chilled, steel! Bessemer! Bessemer! Very good. How much to cover a man? Fourteen, inches by twelve, meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance., A notch at one side for the rifle. There you have it, laddie--the, Cullingworth patent portable bullet-proof shield! Weight? Oh, the weight, would be sixteen pounds. I worked it out. Each company carries its, shields in go-carts, and they are served out on going into action. Give, me twenty thousand good shots, and I'll go in at Calais and come out at, Pekin. Think of it, my boy! the moral effect. One side gets home every, time and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates. No, troops would stand it. The nation that gets it first will pitchfork the, rest of Europe over the edge. They're bound to have it--all of them., Let's reckon it out. There's about eight million of them on a war, footing. Let us suppose that only half of them have it. I say only half\\n\\nWe are at one, he and I, in thinking that the infinite is beyond our, perception. We differ only in that he sees evil and I see good in the, working of the universe. Ah, what a mystery it all is! Let us be honest, and humble and think kindly of each other. There's a line of stars all, winking at me over the opposite roof--winking slyly at the silly little, person with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never, understand.\\n\\nWe came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd, waiting for our chance. Presently up went a very neat little table. I, gave a nod and got it for nine shillings. Then three rather striking, looking chairs, black wood and cane bottoms. Four shillings each I gave, for those. Then a metal umbrella-stand, four and sixpence. That was a, mere luxury, but I was warming to the work. A job lot of curtains all, tied together in a bundle went up. Somebody bid five shillings. The, auctioneer's eye came round to me, and I nodded. Mine again for five, and sixpence. Then I bought a square of red drugget for half-a-crown\\n\\nThen I pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which I had, from the first determined upon as my bedchamber. I found an old packing, case in the yard--a relic of my predecessor's removal--and this made a, very good wash-hand stand for my basin and jug. When it was all fixed up, I walked, swelling with pride, through my own chambers, giving a touch, here and a touch there until I had it perfect. I wish my mother could, see it--or, on second thoughts, I don't; for I know that her first act, would be to prepare gallons of hot water, and to holystone the whole, place down, from garret to cellar--and I know by my own small experience, what that means.\\n\\nThere, now, you see what comes of waving the red rag! Let me make, a concession to appease you. I do believe that Christianity in its, different forms has been the very best thing for the world during all, this long barbarous epoch. Of course, it has been the best thing, else, Providence would not have permitted it. The engineer knows best what, tools to use in strengthening his own machine. But when you say that, this is the best and last tool which will be used, you are laying down, the law a little too much.\\n\\nthough open to attacks of romance. I can recollect her coming to see me, at a junction through which my train passed, with a six months' absence, on either side of the incident. We had five minutes' conversation, my, head out of the carriage window. \\\"Wear flannel next your skin, my dear, boy, and never believe in eternal punishment,\\\" was her last item of, advice as we rolled out of the station. Then to finish her portrait, I need not tell you, who have seen her, that she is young-looking and, comely to be the mother of about thirty-five feet of humanity. She, was in the railway carriage and I on the platform the other day. \\\"Your, husband had better get in or we'll go without him,\\\" said the guard. As, we went off, the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket, and I know, that she was looking for a shilling.\\n\\nI may be doing you an injustice, Bertie, but it seemed to me in, your last that there were indications that the free expression of my, religious views had been distasteful to you. That you should disagree, with me I am prepared for; but that you should object to free and honest, discussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest, over, would, I confess, be a disappointment. The Freethinker is placed, at this disadvantage in ordinary society, that whereas it would be, considered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox, opinion, no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees., There was a time when it took a brave man to be a Christian. Now it, takes a brave man not to be. But if we are to wear a gag, and hide our, thoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimate----no, but I, won't believe it. You and I have put up too many thoughts together and, chased them where-ever{sic} they would double, Bertie; so just write to, me like a good fellow, and tell me that I am an ass. Until I have that, comforting assurance, I shall place a quarantine upon everything which, could conceivably be offensive to you.\\n\\nAnd so the matter blew over; but I very much fear, Bertie, that this is, the first row of a series. I have a presentiment that sooner or later my, position here will become untenable. Still, I shall give it a fair trial, as long as he will let me. Cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have, nothing but inferiors and dependants round him. Now, I like to stand on, my own legs, and think with my own mind. If he'll let me do this we'll, get along very well; but if I know the man he will claim submission\\n\\nwhite-haired, old Roman Catholic priest, who had sat quietly reading his, office in the corner. We fell into the most intimate talk, which lasted, all the way to Avonmouth--indeed, so interested was I that I very nearly, passed through the place without knowing it. Father Logan (for that was, his name) seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should, be--self-sacrificing and pure-minded, with a kind of simple cunning, about him, and a deal of innocent fun. He had the defects as well as the, virtues of his class, for he was absolutely reactionary in his views., We discussed religion with fervour, and his theology was somewhere, about the Early Pliocene. He might have chattered the matter over with, a priest of Charlemagne's Court, and they would have shaken hands after, every sentence. He would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit., It was consistency in his eyes. If our astronomers and inventors and, law-givers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation, be? Is religion the only domain of thought which is non-progressive, and, to be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago?, Can they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider, outlook? A half-formed brain makes a half-formed God, and who shall say, that our brains are even half-formed yet? The truly inspired priest is, the man or woman with the big brain. It is not the shaven patch on the, outside, but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of, election.\\n\\nMind, my dear Bertie, I do not wish to run down your view or that of any, other man. We who claim toleration should be the first to extend it, to others. I am only indicating my own position, as I have often done, before. And I know your reply so well. Can't I hear your grave voice, saying \\\"Have faith!\\\" Your conscience allows you to. Well, mine won't, allow me. I see so clearly that faith is not a virtue, but a vice. It is, a goat which has been herded with the sheep. If a man deliberately shut, his physical eyes and refused to use them, you would be as quick as any, one in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to Nature. And yet you, would counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift, the reason, and, to refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life.\\n\\nCullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as, I had advised, and that he would let me know the result in a few days., Mrs. C. would hardly shake hands with me when I said goodbye; but I like, her the better for that. He must have a great deal of good in him, or he, could not have won her love and confidence so completely. Perhaps there, is another Cullingworth behind the scenes--a softer, tenderer man, who, can love and invite love. If there is, I have never got near him. And, yet I may only have been tapping at the shell. Who knows? For that, matter, it is likely enough that he has never got at the real Johnnie, Munro. But you have, Bertie; and I think that you've had a little too, much of him this time, only you encourage me to this sort of excess by, your sympathetic replies. Well, I've done as much as the General Post, Office will carry for fivepence, so I'll conclude by merely remarking, that a fortnight has passed, and that I have had no news from Avonmouth\\n\\nI often have my doubts, Bertie, if there is such a thing as the, existence of evil? If we could honestly convince ourselves that there, was not, it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion., But don't let us strain truth even for such an object as that. I must, confess that there are some forms of vice, cruelty for example, for, which it is hard to find any explanation, save indeed that it is a, degenerate survival of that war-like ferocity which may once have been, of service in helping to protect the community. No; let me be frank, and, say that I can't make cruelty fit into my scheme. But when you find that, other evils, which seem at first sight black enough, really tend in, the long run to the good of mankind, it may be hoped that those which, continue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some, fashion which is now inexplicable.\\n\\nI left my baggage at the office, and jumped into a tramcar which was, passing the station, with the intention of looking for lodgings, as, I judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel. The conductor, interested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think, that the poorer classes in England are one of the kindliest races on, earth. Policemen, postmen, railway guards, busmen, what good helpful, fellows they all are! This one reckoned the whole thing out, how this, street was central but dear, and the other was out-of-the-way but cheap\\n\\n\\\"I am quite convinced that what you say is true,\\\" he answered; \\\"but Lady, Saltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas, into him. You know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason, with a lady. However, I have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if, you would see Lady Saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood, your views upon this point, and that you are personally a supporter of a, Hereditary Chamber.\\\"\\n\\nWith all respect to you, Bertie, it is very easy to be orthodox. A man, who wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would, certainly choose to be so. As Smiles says--\\\"A dead fish can float with, the stream, but it takes a man to swim against it.\\\" What could be more, noble than the start and the starter of Christianity? How beautiful, the upward struggle of an idea, like some sweet flower blossoming out, amongst rubble and cinders! But, alas! to say that this idea was a final, idea! That this scheme of thought was above the reason! That this, gentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even, imagine a personality without irreverence!--all this will come to rank, with the strangest delusions of mankind. And then how clouded has become, that fine daybreak of Christianity! Its representatives have risen from, the manger to the palace, from the fishing smack to the House of Lords., Nor is that other old potentate in the Vatican, with his art treasures\\n\\nAfter all, true science must be synonymous with religion, since science, is the acquirement of fact; and facts are all that we have from which to, deduce what we are and why we are here. But surely the more we pry into, the methods by which results are brougt{sic} about, the more stupendous, and wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind, the, power which drifts the solar system in safety through space, and, yet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the, honey-bearing flower. What is that central intelligence? You may fit, up your dogmatic scientist with a 300-diameter microscope, and with a, telescope with a six-foot speculum, but neither near nor far can he get, a trace of that great driving power.\\n\\n\\\"they are in a sense relations of yours. You are very closely allied to, the Percies, and the Saltires have Percy blood in them also. They are, only a cadet branch, and you are close upon the main line; but still it, is not for us to deny the connection.\\\" She brought a cold sweat out upon, me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to Lord, Saltire and explaining our respective positions. Several times during, the evening I heard her murmur complacently that they were only the, cadet branch.\\n\\nCullingworth and his wife. They visit nobody, and nobody visits them. My, living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my, head, although I have never done anything unprofessional myself. Who, should I see in the street the other day but the McFarlanes, whom you, will remember at Linlithgow? I was foolish enough to propose to Maimie, McFarlane once, and she was sensible enough to refuse me. What I should, have done had she accepted me, I can't imagine; for that was three years, ago, and I have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then., Well, there's no use yearning for what you can't have, and there's no, other man living to whom I would speak about the matter at all; but life, is a deadly, lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself., Why is it that I am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you\\n\\nI was, as you may imagine, all in a tingle to know what it was that he, wanted with me. However, as he made no allusion to it, I did not care to, ask, and, during our longish walk, we talked about indifferent matters., It was football first, I remember, whether Richmond had a chance against, Blackheath, and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the, old scrimmages. Then he got on to inventions, and became so excited that, he had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all, his points home with his fist upon his palm. I can see him now stopping\\n\\nbut a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth. One, feels that the white upon the hair, like that upon the mountain, should, signify a height attained. I rose and bade him good-night, with a last, impression of him leaning back in his dressing-gown, a sodden cigar-end, in the corner of his mouth, his beard all slopped with whisky, and his, half-glazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr. I, had to go into the street and walk up and down for half-an-hour before I, felt clean enough to go to bed.\\n\\nAt three in the morning, I was awakened by a dreadful crash. Bounding, out of bed I rushed into the other room. Poor Fred was standing in his, long gown, a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning, day. He had pulled over his washing-stand (with what object only his, bemuddled mind could say), and the whole place was a morass of water, with islands of broken crockery. I picked him up and put him back into, his bed again--his body glowing through his night-dress, and his eyes, staring wildly about him. It was evidently impossible to leave him, and, so I spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair., No, it was certainly not a sinecure that I had undertaken.\\n\\nand saying that, poor as our family was, none of them had ever fallen so, low as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous, character and doubtful antecedents. I answered that Cullingworth spoke, sometimes of paying his creditors, that Mrs. Cullingworth was in favour, of it also, and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that I, should sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which I had, no connection. I assured her that if Cullingworth did anything from then, onwards which seemed to me dishonourable, I would disassociate myself, from him, and I mentioned that I had already refused to adopt some of, his professional methods. Well, in reply to this, my mother wrote a, pretty violent letter about what she thought of Cullingworth, which led, to another from me defending him, and showing that there were some deep, and noble traits in his character. That produced another still more, outspoken letter from her; and so the correspondence went on, she, attacking and I defending, until a serious breach seemed to be opening, between us. I refrained from writing at last, not out of ill temper, but, because I thought that if she were given time she would cool down, and, take, perhaps, a more reasonable view of the situation. My father, from, the short note which he sent me, seemed to think the whole business, absolutely irregular, and to refuse to believe my accounts of, Cullingworth's practice and receipts. This double opposition, from the, very people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the, whole affair, caused me to be less disappointed than I should otherwise, have been when it all came to an end. In fact, I was quite in the humour, to finish it myself when Fate did it for me.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said I, \\\"that that is rather further than I am prepared, to go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain, friction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well, that I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall, be happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take, over my duties.\\\"\\n\\nYou make a mistake, however, in assuming that those who think as I, do are such a miserable minority. The whole essence of our thought is, independence and individual judgment; so that we don't get welded into, single bodies as the churches do, and have no opportunity of testing our, own strength. There are, no doubt, all shades of opinion among us; but, if you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the, doctrines usually accepted, and think that sectarian churches tend, to evil rather than good, I fancy that the figures would be rather, surprising. When I read your letter, I made a list of all those men with, whom I ever had intimate talk upon such matters. I got seventeen names\\n\\nthey have the merit of being consoling; for if we could conscientiously, see that sin served a purpose, and a good one, it would take some of the, blackness out of life. It seems to me, then, that Nature, still working, on the lines of evolution, strengthens the race in two ways. The one is, by improving those who are morally strong, which is done by increased, knowledge and broadening religious views; the other, and hardly less, important, is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally, weak. This is accomplished by drink and immorality. These are really two, of the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of, the race. I picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the, garden of life and plucking up the weeds. Looked at in one's own day\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" he explained, \\\"there's no good my putting a forty pound suite, into a bed-room, and then having to chuck it all out of the window in, order to make room for a hundred-pound one. No sense in that, Munro!, Eh, what! I'm going to furnish this house as no house has ever been, furnished. By Crums! I'll bring the folk from a hundred miles round just, to have leave to look at it. But I must do it room by room. Come down, with me and look at the dining-room. You must be hungry after your, journey.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then I have seen something of the same sort in Cullingworth; but, he is so strange a being that I never attach much importance to his, variations. He glares at me like an angry bull occasionally; and then, when I ask him what is the matter, he growls out, \\\"Oh, nothing!\\\" and, turns on his heel. Then at other times he is so cordial and friendly, that he almost overdoes it, and I find myself wondering whether he is, not acting. It must seem ungracious to you that I should speak so of a, man who has been my benefactor; and it seems so to me also, but still, that IS the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes. It's an, absurd idea, too; for what possible object could his wife and he have, in pretending to be amiable, if they did not really feel so? And yet you, know the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not, with his eyes.\\n\\nnever returned. I fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited, their confidence. Others have become warm partisans. But they have, nearly all been very poor people; and when you consider how many one and, sixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which, I must find every quarter for rent, taxes, gas and water, you will, understand that even with some success, I have still found it a hard, matter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder., However, my boy, two quarters are paid up, and I enter upon a third one, with my courage unabated. I have lost about a stone, but not my heart.\\n\\nfrom boot-blacking to medicine-carrying. His one dissipation is cutting, out of paper, or buying in lead (on the rare occasion when we find a, surplus), an army of little soldiers. I have brought a patient into the, consulting room, and found a torrent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, pouring across the table. I have been myself attacked as I sat silently, writing, and have looked up to find fringes of sharp-shooters pushing, up towards me, columns of infantry in reserve, a troop of cavalry on my, flank, while a battery of pea muzzle-loaders on the ridge of my medical, dictionary has raked my whole position--with the round, smiling face of, the general behind it all. I don't know how many regiments he has on a, peace footing; but if serious trouble were to break out, I am convinced, that every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms.\\n\\nIn that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty, night. He was gaily dressed in the first place, check trousers, white, waistcoat, a flower in his button hole. But the look of the man was, very much to my heart. He was ruddy checked and black eyed, with a jolly, stout figure and an honest genial smile. I felt as we clinched hands in, the foggy grimy station that I had met a man and a friend.\\n\\nWell, then, it was night when we reached Avonmouth, and as I popped my, head out of the carriage window, the first thing that my eyes rested, upon was old Cullingworth, standing in, the circle of light under a, gas-lamp. His frock coat was flying open, his waistcoat unbuttoned at, the top, and his hat (a top hat this time) jammed on the back of his, head, with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it. In every way\\n\\nshortly after my start, telling me that he had heard of my proceedings, from my mother, and that he hoped to learn of my success. He is, as I, think you know, an ardent Wesleyan, like all my father's people, and he, told me that the chief Wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend, of his own, that he had learned from him that there was no Wesleyan, doctor, and that, being of a Wesleyan stock myself, if I would present, the enclosed letter of introduction to the minister, I should certainly, find it very much to my advantage. I thought it over, Bertie, and, it seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a, religious organisation to my own advantage, when I condemned them in the, abstract. It was a sore temptation, but I destroyed the letter.\\n\\nShe is a very well-read woman is the mother; she keeps up to date in, French literature as well as in English, and can talk by the hour about, the Goncourts, and Flaubert, and Gautier. Yet she is always hard at, work; and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery. She reads when, she knits, she reads when she scrubs, she even reads when she feeds, her babies. We have a little joke against her, that at an interesting, passage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little, sister's car-hole, the child having turned her head at the critical, instant. Her hands are worn with work, and yet where is the idle woman, who has read as much?\\n\\nHe was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves, then His, existence loses its point, since we and He start upon a different basis., To my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty, and the moral of His life. If He was divine then He COULD not sin, and, there was an end of the matter. We who are not divine and can sin, have, little to learn from a life like that.\\\"\\n\\nWell, this began to look more like business--especially that last, sentence. I took it to Horton, and asked his advice. His opinion was, that I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. So it ended by my, wiring back accepting the partnership--if it is a partnership--and, to-morrow morning I am off to Bradfield with great hopes and a small, portmanteau. I know how interested you are in the personality of, Cullingworth--as every one is who comes, even at second hand, within, range of his influence; and so you may rely upon it that I shall give, you a very full and particular account of all that passes between us. I, am looking forward immensely to seeing him again, and I trust we won't, have any rows.\\n\\nThis was getting too hot, Bertie. I saw all the folly of the thing. I, believed that I might whip him; but at the same time I knew that we were, so much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without, any possible object to serve. For all that, I took my gloves off, and I, think perhaps it was the wisest course after all. If Cullingworth, once thought he had the whiphand of you, you might be sorry for it, afterwards.\\n\\nPoor Whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony. He was staggering, under the weight of a fine Japanese cabinet which he had carried round, from his lodgings. I had asked him to come to the church, and the old, gentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie. Between, ourselves, I had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should, upset him, as in the case of the dinner; but nothing could be more, exemplary than his conduct and appearance. I had introduced him to, Winnie some days before.\\n\\n\\\"Pray step in,\\\" I answered, and waved him into the consulting-room. He, was a pompous, heavy-stepping, thick-voiced sort of person, but to me he, was an angel from on high. I was nervous, and at the same time so afraid, that he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me, that I, found myself drifting into an extravagant geniality. He seated himself, at my invitation and gave a husky cough.\\n\\nyou and I, and have done ever since I have known you. You are true, to your faith, I to my reason--you to your family belief, I to my own, ideas; but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man, and, his affinity for others, depends upon quite other things than views on, abstract questions. Anyway, I can say with all my heart that I wish I, saw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth, sitting, in that ricketty American-leather armchair, with the villanous, lodging-house antimacassar over the back of it. It is good of you to, tell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures; though if I, had not KNOWN that you were so, you may be sure that I should never have, ventured to inflict any of them upon you. My future is now all involved, in obscurity, but it is obvious that the first thing I must do is to, find a fitting house, and my second to cajole the landlord into letting, me enter into possession of it without any prepayment. To that I will, turn myself to-morrow morning, and you shall know the result. Whom, should I hear from the other day but Archie McLagan? Of course it was a, begging letter. You can judge how far I am in a state to lose money; but, in a hot fit I sent him ten shillings, which now, in my cold, I bitterly, regret. With every good wish to you and yours, including your town, your, State, and your great country, yours as ever.\\n\\nI am sure, a most extraordinary figure. Indeed, she looked rather funny, herself, with her palette in one hand, her brush in the other, and the, blank astonishment on her face. I stammered out something about hoping, that she did not mind, which made her more angry than ever. \\\"The, only possible excuse for your conduct, sir, is that you are under the, influence of drink,\\\" said she. \\\"I need not say that we do not require, the services of a medical man in that condition.\\\" I did not try to, disabuse her of the idea, for really I could see no better explanation;, so I beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition. She wrote a letter, to my father about it in the evening, and the old man was very angry, indeed. As to the mother, she is as staunch as steel, and quite prepared, to prove that poor Mrs. A. was a very deep designing person, who had, laid a trap for innocent Johnnie. So there has been a grand row; and not, a soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means, except only, yourself as you read this letter.\\n\\nThen down a winding wooden stair to the basement, where were kitchen, and scullery, dimly lit, and asphalt-floored. As I entered the latter I, stood staring. In every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me., The place was a Golgotha! In that half light the effect was sepulchral., But as I approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished., They were of plaster-of-Paris, and were the leavings evidently of the, dentist, who had been the last tenant. A more welcome sight was a huge, wooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner. It only, wanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room.\\n\\n, The letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so, connected a whole, and to give so plain an account of some of the, troubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the, outset of his career, that I have handed them over to the gentleman who, is about to edit them. There are two of them, the fifth and the ninth\\n\\nand it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing--but then, would come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my, ledger. Where did it come from you will ask. Some from old Whitehall and, his circle of Bohemians. Some from accident cases. Some from new comers, to the town who drifted to me. Some from people whom I met first in, other capacities. An insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to, examine, and that was a very great help. Above all, I learned a fact, which I would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts, as I, have done, a stranger among strangers. Do not think that practice will, come to you. You must go to it. You may sit upon your consulting room, chair until it breaks under you, but without purchase or partnership you, will make little or no progress. The way to do it is to go out, to mix, everywhere with men, to let them know you. You will come back many a, time and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for, you in your absence. Never mind! Go out again. A noisy smoking concert, where you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two, whom you might have seen at home. It took me some time to realise, but I, speak now as one who knows.\\n\\nWait a bit, though! One did. I was awakened at six in the morning one, day by a ringing at my bell, and creeping to the angle of the stair, I saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a top-hat outside. Much, excited, with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head, I ran, back, pulled on some clothes, rushed down, opened the door, and found, myself in the grey morning light face to face with Horton. The good, fellow had come down from Merton in an excursion train, and had been, travelling all night. He had an umbrella under his arm, and two great, straw baskets in each hand, which contained, when unpacked, a cold leg, of mutton, half-a-dozen of beer, a bottle of port, and all sorts of, pasties and luxuries. We had a great day together, and when he rejoined, his excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he, had found.\\n\\neven when we know each other as well as I know you. Why should we, when, that which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of, advance from friendship to intimacy, and from intimacy to something, more sacred still, which can scarcely be written at all, far less made, interesting to another? The time came at last when they were to leave, Birchespool, and my mother and I went round the night before to say, goodbye. Winnie and I were thrown together for an instant.\\n\\nsomebody will be hanged. Questions about this--questions about that. At, last they asked me what I proposed to fasten my magnet to. I answered, to any solid impenetrable object, such as the head of an Admiralty, official. Well, that broke the whole thing up. They wrote with their, compliments, and they were returning my apparatus. I wrote with my, compliments, and they might go to the devil. And so ends a great, historical incident, Munro--eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nBut the thing that took the fun out of him, and made him gnash his, teeth, and stride cursing about the room, was to see a patient walking, up the steps which led to the door of Scarsdale, his opposite neighbour., Scarsdale had a fairly busy practice, and received his people at home, from ten to twelve, so that I got quite used to seeing Cullingworth fly, out of his chair, and rush raving to the window. He would diagnose, the cases, too, and estimate their money value until he was hardly, articulate.\\n\\nquiet-voiced and gentle-mannered. You had only to see the way in which, she looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his, control, and that do what he might, or say what he might, it would, always be the best thing to her. She could be obstinate, too, in a, gentle, dove-like sort of way; but her obstinacy lay always in the, direction of backing up his sayings and doings. This, however, I was, only to find out afterwards; and at that, my first visit, she impressed, me as being one of the sweetest little women that I had ever known.\\n\\nand I felt much more cheery by the time I had finished my letter. I was, just addressing the envelope (observe what a continuous narrative you, get of my proceedings!) when I was set jumping out of my carpet slippers, by a ring at the bell. Through the glass panel I observed that it was a, respectable-looking bearded individual with a top-hat. It was a patient., It MUST be a patient! Then first I realised what an entirely different, thing it is to treat the patient of another man (as I had done with, Horton) or to work a branch of another man's practice (as I had done, with Cullingworth), and to have to do with a complete stranger on your, own account. I had been thrilling to have one. Now that he had come I, felt for an instant as if I would not open the door. But of course that, was only a momentary weakness. I answered his ring with, I fear, rather, a hypocritical air of insouciance, as though I had happened to find, myself in the hall, and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the, stairs.\\n\\nNext morning I came round to my house--MY house, my boy!--for good, and all, after paying off my landlady. Her bill came to more than I, expected, for I only had breakfast and tea, always \\\"dining out\\\" as I, majestically expressed it. However, it was a relief to me to get it, settled, and to go round with my box to Oakley Villas. An ironmonger had, fixed my plate on to the railings for half-a-crown the evening before\\n\\nWell, it was nearly six o'clock, and evening was just creeping in when, we drew up in Bradfield Station. The first thing I saw when I looked out, of the window was Cullingworth, exactly the same as ever, striding in, his jerky way down the platform, his coat flying open, his chin thrust, forward (he is the most under-hung man I have ever seen), and his great, teeth all gleaming, like a good-natured blood-hound. He roared with, delight when he saw me, wrung my hand, and slapped me enthusiastically, upon the shoulder.\\n\\nAnd certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin, laying down laws about the future; for how do we know that there are not, phases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception?, After all, a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average, life is of the period during which we know that the world has been in, existence. But if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight, his, son the same, and his son the same, what would their united experiences, after a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call, night? So all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth, is not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception.\\n\\n\\\"There are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of, handling patients,\\\" he remarked, seating himself on the table and, swinging his legs. \\\"The most obvious is that you must never let them see, that you want them. It should be pure condescension on your part seeing, them at all; and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it, the, more they think of it. Break your patients in early, and keep them well, to heel. Never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many, foolish young men fall into this habit, and are ruined in consequence., Now, this is my form\\\"--he sprang to the door, and putting his two hands, to his mouth he bellowed: \\\"Stop your confounded jabbering down there! I, might as well be living above a poultry show! There, you see,\\\" he added, to me, \\\"they will think ever so much more of me for that.\\\"\\n\\nand skims plates out of the window at the passers-by. Of course, it is, really not funny, but pathetic and deplorable--all the same, it is hard, to keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and, her appearance. I was called in by accident in the first instance; but I, speedily acquired some control over her, so that now the neighbours send, for me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window. She, has a fair competence, so that her little vagaries are a help to me with, my rent. She has, too, a number of curious jugs, statues, and pictures\\n\\nWell, I know that I am a shocking bad story-teller, but I just try to, get things as near the truth as I can manage it. If I only knew how to, colour it up, I could make some of this better reading. I can get along, when I am on one line, but it is when I have to bring in a second line, of events that I understand what C. means when he says that I will never, be able to keep myself in nibs by what I earn in literature.\\n\\nOnce he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge, shop, a place that had been a raper's, with a counter about sixty feet, long. His reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a, little further down on the other side. Poor old \\\"armed transport\\\" worked, so hard that I could not help being touched and grateful; yet I longed, from my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent\\n\\n, Birchespool is really a delightful place, dear Bertie; and I ought to, know something about it, seeing that I have padded a good hundred miles, through its streets during the last seven days. Its mineral springs used, to be quite the mode a century or more ago; and it retains many traces, of its aristocratic past, carrying it with a certain grace, too, as an, emigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled, in Versailles. I forget the new roaring suburbs with their out-going, manufactures and their incoming wealth, and I live in the queer, health-giving old city of the past. The wave of fashion has long passed, over it, but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind., In the High Street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the, railings where the link-boys used to put out their torches, instead of, stamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement, as was the custom, in less high-toned quarters. There are the very high curbstones too\\n\\n\\\"But what is mother to do?\\\" cried the girl, taking up the tale again., \\\"No hotel or lodging-house would take us in while poor Fred is like, that. And we have not the heart to send him to an asylum. Uncle will not, have us any longer, and we have nowhere to go to.\\\" Her grey eyes tried, to look brave, but her mouth would go down at the corners.\\n\\nis either extinct or on the way towards it. Struma, tubercle, nervous, disease, have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten, branch, and the average of the race is thereby improved. I believe from, the little that I have seen of life, that it is a law which acts with, startling swiftness, that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate, their species at all, and that when the curse is hereditary, the second, generation generally sees the end of it.\\n\\n\\\"We must do what we can to make up. Now, I tell you what I am prepared, to do. I was talking about it with Hetty this morning, and she thought, as I did. If we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your, legs under you, it would encourage you to start for yourself, and you, could pay it back as soon as you were able.\\\"\\n\\nIf Cullingworth still bore any resentment, he concealed it most, admirably. But then I knew by experience that that genial loud-voiced, John-Bull manner of his COULD conceal many things. His wife was more, open; and I could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes, that, she at least stood fast to the old quarrel. Cullingworth was little, changed, and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we'll see about that when they do. Meanwhile I am paying ready, money for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps. They think so, well of me here that I could have had the whole place furnished like a, palace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff, only I determined to take, each room in turn when I was ready for it. There's nearly four hundred, pounds under this one ceiling.\\\"\\n\\nStill I must confess that there is nothing about Cullingworth which jars, me so much as the low view which he takes of our profession. I can never, reconcile myself to his ideas, and yet I can never convert him to mine;, so there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide, us altogether. He will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the, question. A profession, in his view, is a means of earning a livelihood\\n\\n\\\"Very good. You are also aware, I presume, that modern projectiles are, either made of or tipped with steel. It may possibly have come to your, ears that magnets attract steel. Permit me now to show you a small, experiment.\\\" He bent over his apparatus, and I suddenly heard the, snapping of electricity. \\\"This,\\\" he continued going across to the, packing case, \\\"is a saloon pistol, and will be exhibited in the museums, of the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was, inaugurated. Into the breech I place a Boxer cartridge, specialty, provided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet. I aim point, blank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall, which is four inches, above the magnet. I am an absolutely dead shot. I fire. You will now, advance, and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end, of the magnet, after which you will apologise to me for that grin.\\\"\\n\\nHeigh ho! it's nearly dawn, and I as wakeful as ever. It is chilly, and, I have draped a blanket round me. I've heard that this is the favourite, hour of the suicide, and I see that I've been tailing off in the, direction of melancholy myself. Let me wind up on a lighter chord by, quoting Cullingworth's latest article. I must tell you that he is, still inflamed by the idea of his own paper, and his brain is in full, eruption, sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs\\n\\nwe are too apt to overlook the ninety-nine decent folk by their own, firesides. I shall not make that mistake any more. The kindliness of the, poor to the poor makes a man sick of himself. And their sweet patience!, Depend upon it, if ever there is a popular rising, the wrongs which lead, to it must be monstrous and indefensible. I think the excesses of the, French Revolution are dreadful enough in themselves, but much more so as, an index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad, protest. And then the wisdom of the poor! It is amusing to read the glib, newspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses. They don't, know the date of Magna Charta, or whom John of Gaunt married; but put, a practical up-to-date problem before them, and see how unerringly they, take the right side. Didn't they put the Reform Bill through in the, teeth of the opposition of the majority of the so-called educated, classes? Didn't they back the North against the South when nearly all, our leaders went wrong? When universal arbitration and the suppression, of the liquor traffic comes, is it not sure to be from the pressure of, these humble folks? They look at life with clearer and more unselfish, eyes. It's an axiom, I think, that to heighten a nation's wisdom you, must lower its franchise.\\n\\nWhen I woke next morning he was in my room, and a funny-looking object, he was. His dressing-gown lay on a chair, and he was putting up a, fifty-six pound dumb-bell, without a rag to cover him. Nature didn't, give him a very symmetrical face, nor the sweetest of expressions; but, he has a figure like a Greek statue. I was amused to see that both his, eyes had a touch of shadow to them. It was his turn to grin when I, sat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a, toadstool. However, he was all for peace that morning, and chatted away, in the most amiable manner possible.\\n\\nand began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the, three hundred spectators. It was fine to see the deliberate way in which, he picked his way among the ink bottles. As he sprang down from the last, bench on to the floor, his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in, the face. Cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him, however, and rushed, him backwards out of the class-room. What he did with him I don't know\\n\\nI was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this, rigmarole. When he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box, and, we could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair. I, was still looking at the medal, which, from the dents all over it, had, evidently been often used as a target, when I felt a timid touch upon my, sleeve; it was Mrs. Cullingworth, who was looking earnestly at me with a, very distressed expression upon her face.\\n\\nfor you could never tell what it might lead to. His temper was nothing, less than infernal. I have seen him in the dissecting-rooms begin to, skylark with a fellow, and then in an instant the fun would go out of, his face, his little eyes would gleam with fury, and the two would be, rolling, worrying each other like dogs, below the table. He would, be dragged off, panting and speechless with fury, with his wiry hair, bristling straight up like a fighting terrier's.\\n\\nwhich was as welcome to me, and as much of a windfall, as the Spanish, wreck to Robinson Crusoe. There were too pairs of thick blankets, two, sheets, a counterpane, a pillow, a camp-stool, two stuffed bears' paws, (of all things in this world!), two terra-cotta vases, a tea-cosy, two, pictures in frames, several books, an ornamental ink-pot, and a number, of antimacassars and coloured tablecloths. It is not until you own a, table with a deal top and mahogany legs, that you understand what the, true inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is. Right on the top of this, treasure came a huge hamper from the Apothecaries' Society with the, drugs which I had ordered. When they were laid out in line, the bottles, extended right down one side of the dining-room and half down the other., As I walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions, I, felt less radical in my views, and begun to think that there might be, something in the rights of property after all.\\n\\nas they do in the mediaeval churches, he might, I am sure, paper, his consulting room with them. A favourite device of his with an, impressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure. \\\"My, dear,\\\" he will say, swaying some girl about by the shoulders, with his, nose about three inches from hers, \\\"you'll feel better to-morrow at a, quarter to ten, and at twenty past you'll be as well as ever you were in, your life. Now, keep your eye on the clock, and see if I am not right.\\\", Next day, as likely as not, her mother will be in, weeping tears of, joy; and another miracle has been added to Cullingworth's record. It may, smell of quackery, but it is exceedingly useful to the patient.\\n\\nIn the meantime I had enlisted a most unexpected ally. On the second, evening a card was solemnly brought up by the landlady's daughter from, the lodger who occupied the room below. On it was inscribed \\\"Captain, Whitehall\\\"; and then underneath, in brackets, \\\"Armed Transport.\\\" On, the back of the card was written, \\\"Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), presents his compliments to Dr. Munro, and would be glad of his, company to supper at 8.30.\\\" To this I answered, \\\"Dr. Munro presents his, compliments to Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), and will be most, happy to accept his kind invitation.\\\" What \\\"Armed Transport\\\" might mean, I had not an idea, but I thought it well to include it, as he seemed so, particular about it himself.\\n\\nFirst of all, about the practice. I told you that I was to have a room, immediately opposite to Cullingworth's, and that all the surgical cases, were to be turned over to me. For a few days I had nothing to do, except, to listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients, or making, speeches to them from the top of the stairs. However, a great \\\"Dr. Stark, Munro, Surgeon,\\\" has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs\\n\\nTalking of cheeriness, you misunderstand me, Bertie, if you think (as, you seem to imply) that I take a dark view of things. It is true that I, discard some consolations which you possess, because I cannot convince, myself that they are genuine; but in this world, at least, I see immense, reason for hope, and as to the next I am confident that all will be for, the best. From annihilation to beatification I am ready to adapt myself, to whatever the great Designer's secret plan my be.\\n\\nSo the Cullingworths did their bag-procession through the doctors', quarter alone to-day, and I walked to the park, where I sat down on one, of the seats, lit a cigar, and thought the whole matter over. I was down, on my luck at first; but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the, budding flowers soon set me right again. I began my last letter among, the stars, and I am inclined to finish this one among the flowers, for, they are rare companions when one's mind is troubled. Most things on, this earth, from a woman's beauty to the taste of a nectarine, seem to, be the various baits with which Nature lures her silly gudgeons. They, shall eat, they shall propagate, and for the sake of pleasing themselves, they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them. But, there lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower. It's charm, has no ulterior motive.\\n\\nAnd this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair., Cullingworth, who had drunk off a couple of glasses, waited until his, wife had left the room, and then began to talk of the difficulty of, getting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of, patients. This led us round to the ways in which a man might take his, exercise indoors, and that to boxing. Cullingworth took a couple of, pairs of gloves out of a cupboard, and proposed that we should fight a, round or two then and there.\\n\\nNow, first of all, I want to tell you about how the practice has been, going on. The week after I wrote last showed a slight relapse. I only, took two pounds. But on the next I took a sudden jump up to three pounds, seven shillings, and this last week I took three pounds ten. So it was, steadily creeping up; and I really thought that I saw my road clear, in front of me, when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue. There were, reasons, however, which prevented my being very disappointed when it did, come down; and these I must make clear to you.\\n\\nWell, with half-an-hour for lunch, this extraordinary business went, on till a quarter to four in the afternoon. When the last patient had, departed, Cullingworth led the way into the dispensary, where all the, fees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value., There were seventeen half-sovereigns, seventy-three shillings, and, forty-six florins; or thirty-two pounds eight and sixpence in all., Cullingworth counted it up, and then mixing the gold and silver into, one heap, he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it., Finally, he raked it into the canvas bag which I had seen the night, before, and lashed the neck up with a boot-lace.\\n\\nWell, she had heard some details about the Cullingworths which, displeased her when I first knew them. Then came the smash-up at, Avonmouth, and my mother liked them less and less. She was averse to my, joining them in Bradfield, and it was only by my sudden movement at the, end that I escaped a regular prohibition. When I got there, the very, first question she asked (when I told her of their prosperity) was, whether they had paid their Avonmouth creditors. I was compelled to, answer that they had not. In reply she wrote imploring me to come away\\n\\nHis wisdom, His forethought for small wants, His providing of luxuries, for His creatures. On the other hand, do not let us be disingenuous, enough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain, in cruelty, in all which, seems to be a slur upon His work. The best that we can say for them is, to hope that they are not as bad as they seem, and possibly lead to some, higher end. The voices of the ill-used child and of the tortured animal, are the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer.\\n\\nwhen the main trunk is rotten beneath them, and both must in their, present forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin. The movement, of human thought, though slow, is still in the direction of truth, and, the various religions which man sheds as he advances (each admirable in, its day) will serve, like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel, to, give the rate and direction of his progress.\\n\\nAnd now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole, life. Whom do you think I had a letter from last Tuesday week? From, Cullingworth, no less. It had no beginning, no end, was addressed, all wrong, and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a, prescription. How it ever reached me is a wonder. This is what he had to, say:--\\n\\nseemed to fall away, and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable, Guide of the Universe were for an instant face to face. I was on my, knees--hurled down all against my own will, as it were. And even then, I could find no words to say. Only vague yearnings and emotions and a, heartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good. What could, I say? Every prayer seemed based on the idea that God was a magnified, man--that He needed asking and praising and thanking. Should the cog of, the wheel creak praise to the Engineer? Let it rather cog harder, and, creak less. Yet I did, I confess, try to put the agitation of my soul, into words. I meant it for a prayer; but when I considered afterwards, the \\\"supposing thats\\\" and \\\"in case ofs\\\" with which it was sprinkled, it, must have been more like a legal document. And yet I felt soothed and, happier as I went downstairs again.\\n\\nI have often wondered why some of those writing fellows don't try their, hands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of, puberty until he begins to find his feet a little. Men are very fond, of analysing the feelings of their heroines, which they cannot possibly, know anything about, while they have little to say of the inner, development of their heroes, which is an experience which they have, themselves undergone. I should like to try it myself, but it would need, blending with fiction, and I never had a spark of imagination. But I, have a vivid recollection of what I went through myself. At the time I, thought (as everybody thinks) that it was a unique experience; but since, I have heard the confidences of my father's patients I am convinced that, it is the common lot. The shrinking, horrible shyness, alternating with, occasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against, it, the longing for close friendship, the agonies over imaginary, slights, the extraordinary sexual doubts, the deadly fears caused by, non-existent diseases, the vague emotion produced by all women, and the, half-frightened thrill by particular ones, the aggressiveness caused, by fear of being afraid, the sudden blacknesses, the profound, self-distrust--I dare bet that you have felt every one of them, Bertie\\n\\nis pronounced by Dr. Stark Munro, of Oakley Villa, to have suffered no, serious injury.\\\" As Cullingworth used to say, it is hard enough for the, young doctor to push his name into any publicity, and he must take what, little chances he has. Perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake, their heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal; but, I was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing, their own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in The, Times.\\n\\nYou'll see from the address of this letter, Bertie, that I have left, Scotland and am in Yorkshire. I have been here three months, and am now, on the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the, queerest prospects. Good old Cullingworth has turned out a trump, as I, always knew he would. But, as usual, I am beginning at the wrong end, so, here goes to give you an idea of what has been happening.\\n\\nWhat should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture, submitted to him, and who, having satisfied himself that the account, given of the painting of the picture is incorrect, at once concludes, that no one ever painted it, or at least asserts that he has no possible, means of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not? That is, as, it seems to me, a fair statement of the position of some of the more, extreme agnostics. \\\"Is not the mere existence of the picture in itself, a proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it? one might ask.\\\", \\\"Why, no,\\\" says the objector. \\\"It is possible that the picture produced, itself by the aid of certain rules. Besides, when the picture was first, submitted to me I was assured that it had all been produced within a, week, but by examining it I am able to say with certainty that it has, taken a considerable time to put together. I am therefore of opinion, that it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all.\\\"\\n\\nSo ends the history of a failure. I am, as you know, inclined to, fatalism, and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists; so I am, bound to think that this experience was given to me for some end. It, was a preliminary canter for the big race, perhaps. My mother was, disappointed, but tried to show it as little as possible. My father, was a little sardonic over the matter. I fear that the gap between us, widens. By the way, an extraordinary card arrived from Cullingworth, during my absence. \\\"You are my man,\\\" said he; \\\"mind that I am to have, you when I want you.\\\" There was no date and no address, but the postmark, was Bradfield in the north of England. Does it mean nothing? Or may it, mean everything? We must wait and see.\\n\\n, Well, the second person whom I admitted through my door was the High, Church curate of the parish--at least, I deduced High Church from his, collar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain. He seemed to be, a fine upstanding manly fellow--in fact, I am bound in honesty to admit, that I have never met the washy tea-party curate outside the pages of, Punch. As a body, I think they would compare very well in manliness (I, do not say in brains) with as many young lawyers or doctors. Still, I, have no love for the cloth. Just as cotton, which is in itself the most, harmless substance in the world, becomes dangerous on being dipped into, nitric acid, so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once, soaked in sectarian religion. If he has any rancour or hardness in him, it will bring it out. I was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my, visitor, though I trust that I received him with fitting courtesy. The, quick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my, consulting-room, told me that it was not quite what he had expected.\\n\\nMy red drugget I laid out in the centre, and fastened it down with, brass-headed nails. It looked much smaller than I had hoped,--a little, red island on an ocean of deal board, or a postage stamp in the middle, of an envelope. In the centre of it I placed my table, with three, medical works on one side of it, and my stethoscope and dresser's case, upon the other. One chair went with the table, of course; and then I, spent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other, two looked better together--a dense block of chairs, as it were--or, scattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous, chairs. I placed them finally one on the right, and one in front of, the table. Then I put down my fender, and nailed \\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo, Players,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle\\\" on to three of the walls, with the mental, promise that my first spare half-crown should buy a picture for the, fourth. In the window I placed my little square table, and balanced upon, it a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which I, had brought in my trunk. Finally, I found a pair of dark brown curtains, among the job lot which I had bought at the sale, and these I put up and, drew pretty close together, so that a subdued light came into the room\\n\\nwith the bustle of green tree tops. It was a windy day, and the clouds, were drifting swiftly across the heavens, with glimpses of blue between., I don't know how it was, but as I stood looking through the grimy panes, in the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my, responsibility to some higher power came upon me, with a vividness which, was overpowering. Here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened., What was to be the end of it? I had strength, I had gifts. What was I, going to do with them? All the world, the street, the cabs, the houses\\n\\nYou'll wonder what has taken me off on this line. Only that I seem, to see it all in action in my own life. But, as usual, I have started, merrily off with an appendix, so I shall go back and begin my report, as nearly as possible where I ended the last. First of all, I may, say generally that the clouds were thinning then, and that they broke, shortly afterwards. During the last few months we have never once quite, lost sight of the sun.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, curse the politics! Red pepper well rubbed in, that's my idea of a, paper. Call it the Scorpion. Chaff the Mayor and the Council until they, call a meeting and hang themselves. I'd do the snappy paragraphs, and, you would do the fiction and poetry. I thought about it during the, night, and Hetty has written to Murdoch's to get an estimate for the, printing. We might get our first number out this day week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you've got your armour there, laddie, it will be pierced,\\\" says he., \\\"Put up forty feet thick of steel; and I'll build a gun that will knock, it into tooth-powder. It would blow away, and set the folk coughing, after I had one shot at it. But you can't pierce armour which only drops, after the shot has passed through. What's the good of it? Why it, keeps out the water. That's the main thing, after all. I call it the, Cullingworth spring-shutter screen. Eh, what, Munro? I wouldn't take, a quarter of a million for the idea. You see how it would work. Spring, shutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks, used to be. They are in sections, three feet broad, we will say, and, capable when let down of reaching the keel. Very well! Enemy sends a, shot through Section A of the side. Section A shutter is lowered. Only, a thin film, you see, but enough to form a temporary plug. Enemy's ram, knocks in sections B, C, D of the side. What do you do? Founder? Not, a bit; you lower sections B, C, and D of Cullingworth's spring-shutter, screen. Or you knock a hole on a rock. The same thing again. It's a, ludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution, would absolutely save her. And it's equally good for ironclads also. A, shot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them., Down go your shutters, and all is well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I could. Such a novel, Munro, that when they'd read the first, chapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out., They'd wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was, coming next. By Crums, I'll go and begin it now!\\\" And, with another, somersault over the end of the bed, he rushed from the room, with the, tassels of his dressing gown flying behind him.\\n\\nhis guards, and his cellars of wine in a more logical position. They are, all good and talented men, and in the market of brains are worth perhaps, as much as they get. But how can they bring themselves to pose as the, representatives of a creed, which, as they themselves expound it, is, based upon humility, poverty, and self-denial? Not one of them who, would not quote with approval the parable of the Wedding Guest. But, try putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next Court, reception. It happened some little time ago with a Cardinal, and England, rang with his protests. How blind not to see how they would spring at, one leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim, the last as the special badge of their master!\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said I, \\\"that's easily set right.\\\" I marched out of the room and, downstairs, with both Cullingworth and his wife behind me. Into the yard, I went, and, picking up a big hammer, I started for the front door, with, the pair still at my heels. I got the forked end of the hammer under my, plate, and with a good wrench I brought the whole thing clattering on to, the pavement.\\n\\nBut if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its, honey bag and its collecting forceps, and for the lowly seed so as to, have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil, then is it, conceivable that we, the highest product of all, are overlooked? It is, NOT conceivable. The idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as, we see it. I say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty, of a most watchful Providence.\\n\\nI'll give you an idea of what a day's work is like. We breakfast about, nine o'clock, and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to, drop in. Many of them are very poor people, belonging to the colliery, clubs, the principle of which is, that the members pay a little over a, halfpenny a week all the year round, well or ill, in return for which, they get medicine and attendance free. \\\"Not much of a catch for the, doctors,\\\" you would say, but it is astonishing what competition there, is among them to get the appointment. You see it is a certainty for, one thing, and it leads indirectly to other little extras. Besides, it, amounts up surprisingly. I have no doubt that Horton has five or six, hundred a year from his clubs alone. On the other hand, you can imagine, that club patients, since they pay the same in any case, don't let their, ailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room.\\n\\nCullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper. He has carried, the matter through with his usual energy, but he doesn't know enough, about local affairs to be able to write about them, and it is a question, whether he can interest the people here in anything else. At present we, are prepared to run the paper single-handed; we are working seven hours, a day at the practice; we are building a stable; and in our odd hours we, are practising at our magnetic ship-protector, with which Cullingworth, is still well pleased, though he wants to get it more perfect before, submitting it to the Admiralty.\\n\\nWas it not fine? It stirred my blood, and the words rang like a bugle, call in my head. It braced me, and the time was coming when all the, bracing I could get would not be too much. I copied it out, and pinned, it on one side of my mantel-piece. On the other I stuck up a chip from, Carlyle, which I daresay is as familiar to you as to me. \\\"One way or, another all the light, energy, and available virtue which we have does, come out of us, and goes very infallibly into God's treasury, living and, working through eternities there. We are not lost--not a single atom, of us--of one of us.\\\" Now, there is a religious sentence which is, intellectually satisfying, and therefore morally sound.\\n\\nWell, I really never intended to inflict all this upon you, Bertie. I, thought I could have made my position clear in a page or so. But you can, see how one point has brought up another. Even now I am leaving so much, unsaid. I can see with such certainty exactly what you will say. \\\"If, you deduce a good Providence from the good things in nature, what do, you make of the evil?\\\" That's what you will say. Suffice it that I am, inclined to deny the existence of evil. Not another word will I say upon, the subject; but if you come back to it yourself, then be it on your own, head.\\n\\nTo some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them, to say one. With a loud \\\"hush\\\" he would rush at them, thump them on the, chests, listen to their hearts, write their labels, and then run them, out of the room by their shoulders. One poor old lady he greeted with a, perfect scream. \\\"You've been drinking too much tea!\\\" he cried. \\\"You are, suffering from tea poisoning!\\\" Then, without allowing her to get a word, in, he clutched her by her crackling black mantle, dragged her up to the, table, and held out a copy of \\\"Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence\\\" which was, lying there. \\\"Put your hand on the book,\\\" he thundered, \\\"and swear that, for fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa.\\\" She swore with, upturned eyes, and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand\\n\\nIs he not a conundrum? If he interests you at a distance (and I take, for granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional, compliment) you can think how piquant he is in actual life. I must, confess, however, that I can never shake off the feeling that I am, living with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may, possibly bite. Well, it won't be very long before I write again, and, by that time I shall probably know whether I am likely to find, any permanent billet here or not. I am so sorry to hear about Mrs., Swanborough's indisposition. You know that I take the deepest interest, in everything that affects you. They tell me here that I am looking very, fit, though I think they ought to spell it with an \\\"a.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you, Bertie, the tears started to my eyes, and I could hardly, gulp out a word or two of thanks. What a crisscross of qualities in, one human soul! It was not the deed or the words; but it was the almost, womanly look in the eyes of this broken, drink-sodden old Bohemian--the, sympathy and the craving for sympathy which I read there. Only for an, instant though, for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half, defiant manner.\\n\\nwho leaned upon his Martini, with two little white kittens peeping over, either shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack. I was so moved at the, sight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old, country, that I sprang up on my box, took off my hat, and gave them, three cheers. At first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine, fashion--like a row of cows over a wall. At the second a good many, joined, and at the third my own voice was entirely lost. So I turned to, go my way, and the soldier laddies to go theirs; and I wondered which of, us had the stiffest and longest fight before us.\\n\\nDreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind, but I thought, of her nose and was reassured. An examination revealed everything. She, was a married woman. The lines were solemnly produced. Her husband was a, seaman. She had passed as a miss, because she thought I was more likely, to take a housekeeper without encumbrances. Her husband had come home, unexpectedly from a long voyage, and had returned last night. And, then--plot within plot--the other woman was not her sister, but a, friend, whose name was Miss Williams. She thought I was more likely to, take two sisters than two friends. So we all came to know who the other, was; and I, having given Jack permission to remain, assigned the other, top room to Miss Williams. From absolute solitude I seemed to be rapidly, developing into the keeper of a casual ward.\\n\\nhowever, part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact, that whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort, his exact, opposite at once springs up to neutralise him. You have a Mameluke: up, jumps a Crusader. You have a Fenian: up jumps an Orangeman. Every force, has its recoil. And so these more hide-bound scientists must be set, against those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in, the year 4004 B. C.\\n\\nI had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me, into the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as, to our financial position. He began the interview by unbuttoning his, waistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space, two, inches from the left sternal line. I did so, and was shocked to hear a, well-marked mitral regurgitant murmur.\\n\\nIf I hadn't been a fool, Bertie, I should never have consented. It's, one of my many weaknesses, that, whether it's a woman or a man, anything, like a challenge sets me off. But I knew Cullingworth's ways, and I told, you in my last what a lamb of a temper he has. None the less, we pushed, back the table, put the lamp on a high bracket, and stood up to one, another.\\n\\nfor it was merely a prospecting expedition, and I intended to return for, my luggage if I saw reason for hope. Alas! there was not the faintest., The sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that, ever lived. It is one of those picturesque little English towns with, a history and little else. A Roman trench and a Norman keep are its, principal products. But to me the most amazing thing about it was the, cloud of doctors which had settled upon it. A double row of brass plates, flanked the principal street. Where their patients came from I could not, imagine, unless they practised upon each other. The host of the \\\"Bull\\\", where I had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by, saying that, as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly, twelve miles in every direction, it was in these scattered farm-houses, that the Stockwell doctors found their patients. As I chatted with him a, middle-aged, dusty-booted man trudged up the street. \\\"There's Dr. Adam,\\\", said he. \\\"He's only a new-comer, but they say that some o' these days, he'll be starting his carriage.\\\" \\\"What do you mean by a new-comer?\\\", I asked. \\\"Oh, he's scarcely been here ten years,\\\" said the landlord., \\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"Can you tell me when the next train leaves for, Bradfield?\\\" So back I came, rather heavy at heart, and having spent, ten or twelve shillings which I could ill afford. My fruitless journey, seemed a small thing, however, when I thought of the rising Stockwellite, with his ten years and his dusty boots. I can trudge along a path\\n\\nand, as we are all very fond of the kind old lady, we were trying to, keep things as quiet as possible down-stairs. Suddenly there came, a bang! bang! bang! at the knocker; and then in an instant another, rattling series of knocks, as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick, in the panel. After all our efforts for silence it was exasperating. I, rushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand, to commence a fresh bombardment. \\\"What on earth's the matter?\\\" I asked\\n\\nBut there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man's heart, singing. Good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle., The race is improving. There are far fewer criminal convictions. There, is far more education. People sin less and think more. When I meet a, brutal looking fellow I often think that he and his type may soon be, as extinct as the great auk. I am not sure that in the interest of the, 'ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of Bill Sykes, to show, our children's children what sort of a person he was.\\n\\nI cannot be bigoted, my dear boy, when I say from the bottom of my heart, that I respect every good Catholic and every good Protestant, and that, I recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful, instrument in the hands of that inscrutable Providence which rules, all things. Just as in the course of history one finds that the most, far-reaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime; so in, religion, although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate, conception of the Creator and His ways, it may none the less be the very, best practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it. But, if it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to, adopt it, it is equally so for those to whom it is not, to protest, against it, until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets, gradually leavened, and pushed a little further upon their slow upward, journey.\\n\\nHowever, the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my, attention and breaking the blow which I had had in the Cullingworth, letter. It made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should, prove to be a patient, and the apparent patient an outsider. So back, I went, in a much more judicial frame of mind, to read that precious, document over again, and to make up my mind what it was that I should, do.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I had news of Cullingworth from Smeaton, who was in the, same football team at college, and who had called when he was passing, through Bradfield. His report was not a very favourable one. The, practice had declined considerably. People had no doubt accustomed, themselves to his eccentricities, and these had ceased to impress them., Again, there had been one or two coroner's inquests, which had spread, the impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs. If, the coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which Cullingworth had, effected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with, his censures. But, as you can understand, C.'s rival medical men, were not disposed to cover him in any way. He had never had much, consideration for them.\\n\\nWell, I examined him, and I found his own account not very far from the, truth. I went over him carefully from head to foot, and there was not, much left as Nature made it. He had mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of, the liver, Bright's disease, an enlarged spleen, and incipient dropsy., I gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance, if not of total, abstinence; but I fear that my words made no impression. He chuckled\\n\\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Cullingworth and I ran the practice together. As, a substitute for him I was a dreadful failure. They would not believe in, me in the least. I felt that I was as flat as water after champagne., I could not address them from the stairs, nor push them about, nor, prophesy to the anaeemic women. I was much too solemn and demure after, what they had been accustomed to. However, I held the thing together, as best I could, and I don't think that he found the practice much the, worse when he was able to take it over. I could not descend to what I, thought was unprofessional, but I did my very best to keep the wheels, turning.\\n\\ndebating, political, social, athletic, every one of them is a tool to, your hands. But you must show them what a good man you are. You must, throw yourself into each with energy and conviction. You will soon, find yourself on the committee--possibly the secretary, or even in the, presidential chair. Do not grudge labour where the return may be remote, and indirect. Those are the rungs up which one climbs.\\n\\nOur evening occupations just about that time were of a most, extraordinary character. You are aware that there is a substance, called, waxy matter, which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the, course of certain diseases. What this may be and how it is formed has, been a cause for much bickering among pathologists. Cullingworth had, strong views upon the subject, holding that the waxy matter was really, the same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver., But it is one thing to have an idea, and another to be able to prove, it. Above all, we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment. But, fortune favoured us in the most magical way. The Professor of Pathology, had come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition., With pride he exhibited the organ to us in the class-room before, ordering his assistant to remove it to the ice-chest, preparatory to its, being used for microscopical work in the practical class. Cullingworth, saw his chance, and acted on the instant. Slipping out of the classroom\\n\\nseemed to encourage him to become more offensive. At the end of the, match, wanting two to win, I put down the white which was in the jaws of, the pocket. He cried out that this was bad form. I contended that it was, folly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game, and, on, his continuing to make remarks, I appealed to the marker, who took the, same view as I did. This opposition only increased his anger, and he, suddenly broke out into most violent language, abusing me in unmeasured, terms. I said to him, \\\"If you have anything to say to me, Cullingworth\\n\\nwhich was certainly reasonable enough, since no one else could have, written it. Knowing Cullingworth as well as I did, I took it with, reservations and deductions. How could he have made so rapid and, complete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete, stranger? It was incredible. And yet there must be some truth in it, or, he would not invite me to come down and test it. On the whole, I thought, that I had better move very cautiously in the matter; for I was happy, and snug where I was, and kept on putting a little by, which I hoped, would form a nucleus to start me in practice. It is only a few pounds, up to date, but in a year or so it might mount to something. I wrote, to Cullingworth, therefore, thanking him for having remembered me, and, explaining how matters stood.\\n\\nhowever; and if you forced the pace in the morning, he would undress and, go to bed about tea-time, with a full conviction that all the clocks, had gone mad. These two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old, Whitehall had in his own words, \\\"thrown a rope\\\"; and long after I had, gone to bed I could hear the clink of their glasses, and the tapping of, their pipes against the fender in the room below.\\n\\nand use some remarkably bad English. The meaning of it, when all the, \\\"whereas's and aforesaids\\\" were picked out, was, that Winnie had about a, hundred a year of her own. It could not make me love her a shade better, than I did; but at the same time I won't be so absurd as to say that I, was not glad, or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it, would otherwise have been.\\n\\nHe had a dash of the heroic in him. On one occasion he was placed in, such a position that he must choose between compromising a lady, or, springing out of a third-floor window. Without a moment's hesitation he, hurled himself out of the window. As luck would have it, he fell through, a large laurel bush on to a garden plot, which was soft with rain, and, so escaped with a shaking and a bruising. If I have to say anything that, gives a bad impression of the man, put that upon the other side.\\n\\n, I have some recollection, my dear Bertie, that when I wrote you a, rambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago, I wound up, by saying that I might have something more interesting to tell you next, time. Well, so it has turned out! The whole game is up here, and I am, off upon a fresh line of rails altogether. Cullingworth is to go one, way and I another; and yet I am glad to say that there has not been any, quarrel between us. As usual, I have begun my letter at the end, but, I'll work up to it more deliberately now, and let you know exactly how, it came about.\\n\\nIf, Bertie, it had been old student days, I should have sailed straight, in, as you or any other fellow would have done. My flesh crept with my, loathing for the brute. But I had also to think of what I was and where, I was, and what I had come there to do. However, there are some things, which a man cannot stand, so I took a couple of steps forward, put my, hand on the fellow's shoulder, and said in as conciliatory and genial a, voice as I could muster: \\\"Come, come, my lad! Pull yourself together.\\\"\\n\\nThis with her funny manner set the ladies laughing, and the whole, business seemed lighter and easier. I promised to have the room ready, by eight o'clock. Mrs. La Force arranged to bring her son round at that, hour, and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than I deserved;, for after all it was a business matter, and a resident patient was the, very thing that I needed. I was able to assure Mrs. La Force that I, had had a similar case under my charge before--meaning, of course, poor, \\\"Jimmy,\\\" the son of Lord Saltire. Miss Williams escorted them to the, door, and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how I, got through with it, and that I was within sight of my carriage.\\n\\nI recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom, for fear of some imaginary infection. He was haunted, too, with a, perpetual dread of eavesdroppers, which used to make him fly at the door, and fling it open in the middle of his conversation, pouncing out into, the passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act. Once it was, the maid with the tea tray that he caught, I remember; and I can see her, astonished face now, with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar.\\n\\nYou remember that we (Paul and I) had just engaged a certain, Miss Williams to come and keep house for us. I felt that on the, basement-lodger principle I had not control enough; so we now entered, upon a more business-like arrangement, by which a sum (though, alas! an, absurdly small one) was to be paid her for her services. I would it had, been ten times as much, for a better and a more loyal servant man never, had. Our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she re-entered the, house.\\n\\nindirectly I may say that I did so. From that day Lady Saltire was as, rude to me as she could be, and never lost an opportunity of making, attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions. Of these I never, took the slightest notice; but at last on an evil day she went for me, point-blank, so that there was no getting away from her. It was just, at the end of lunch, when the footman had left the room. She had been, talking about Lord Saltire's going up to London to vote upon some, question in the House of Lords.\\n\\nBertie. I send you one or two enormously long letters, burdened, as far, as I can remember them, with all sorts of useless detail. Then, in spite, of your kindly answers and your sympathy, which I have done so little to, deserve, I drop you completely for more than six months. By this J pen, I swear that it shall not happen again; and this letter may serve to, bridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs, in which\\n\\nNo, you mustn't be too sure of that majority of yours. Taking the, scientific, the medical, the professional classes, I question whether it, exists at all. The clergy, busy in their own limited circles, and coming, in contact only with those who agree with them, have not realised how, largely the rising generation has outgrown them. And (with exceptions, like yourself) it is not the most lax, but the BEST of the younger men\\n\\n\\\"As to the magnet,\\\" said he, \\\"I'm very sorry for my country, but there, is no more command of the seas for her. I'll have to let the thing go, to the Germans. It's not my fault. They must not blame me when the smash, comes. I put the thing before the Admiralty, and I could have made a, board school understand it in half the time. Such letters, Munro! Colney, Hatch on blue paper. When the war comes, and I show those letters\\n\\nundisturbed. My tastes are so simple that I cannot imagine any advantage, which wealth can give--save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a, good man or a good cause. Why should people ever take credit for charity, when they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their, guineas in any other fashion? I gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster, the other day (having no change in my pocket), and the mater could not, quite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility. I, could have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one, nor the other, but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little, dash of swagger away down at the bottom of it. What had I ever had from, my chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow, brought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had, been useful?\\n\\nAnd so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that I could not, come. It is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life, obviously divides, and you take one turning or the other after vainly, trying to be sure about the finger-post. I think after all I chose, rightly. A ship's surgeon must remain a ship's surgeon, while here there, is no horizon to my possibilities.\\n\\n\\\"Just exactly in South America,\\\" he cried, pacing with his quick little, steps up and down the dingy room. \\\"Look here, laddie! There's a great, continent from the equator to the icebergs, and not a man in it who, could correct an astigmatism. What do they know of modern eye-surgery, and refraction? Why, dammy, they don't know much about it in the, provinces of England yet, let alone Brazil. Man, if you could only see, it, there's a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round, the whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for, an oculist. Eh, Munro, what? By Crums, I'll come back and I'll buy, Bradfield, and I'll give it away as a tip to a waiter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I'm sorry we haven't got a crowded day for you, Munro,\\\" said he., \\\"Of course, we can't command these things, and must take them as they, come. Now then, now then, make a gangway, can't you?\\\"--this to his, patients. \\\"Come here and see the waiting-room. Pooh! what an atmosphere!, Why on earth can't you open the windows for yourselves? I never saw, such folk! There are thirty people in this room, Munro, and not one with, sense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation.\\\"\\n\\nAt one end of Cadogan Terrace (where I am lodging) there is a wide open, space where several streets meet. In the centre of this stands a large, lamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal, a foot or so high, and ten, or twelve across. Well, as I strolled along I saw there was something, going on round this lamppost. A crowd of people had gathered, with a, swirl in the centre. I was, of course, absolutely determined not to get, mixed up in any row; but I could not help pushing my way through the, crowd to see what was the matter.\\n\\nYou met her, Bertie! You must remember her sweet face, her sensitive, mouth, her peering, short-sighted eyes, her general suggestion of a, plump little hen, who is still on the alert about her chickens. But you, cannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life. Those helpful, fingers! That sympathetic brain! Ever since I can remember her she has, been the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters\\n\\nhave it adopted in every civilised country, see all conceivable, applications of it, count up his probable royalties, sketch out the, novel methods in which he would invest his gains, and finally retire, with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed. And you would, be swept along by his words, and would be carried every foot of the, way with him, so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you, suddenly fell back to earth again, and found yourself trudging the city, street a poor student, with Kirk's Physiology under your arm, and hardly, the price of your luncheon in your pocket.\\n\\nHe began to laugh at that. \\\"It was a little precipitate on my part,\\\", said he; \\\"but I do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to, position or terms. You may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of, our client, Lord Saltire? Not? To put it briefly then, his son, the Hon., James Derwent, the heir to the estates and the only child, was struck, down by the sun while fishing without his hat last July. His mind has, never recovered from the shock, and he has been ever since in a chronic, state of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into, violent mania. His father will not allow him to be removed from, Lochtully Castle, and it is his desire that a medical man should stay, there in constant attendance upon his son. Your physical strength would, of course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which, I have spoken. The remuneration will be twelve pounds a month, and you, would be required to take over your duties to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nI assure you that I have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as, to whence I have come from, whither I am going, or what I am here for., It is not for want of inquiry, or from indifference. I have mastered, the principles of several religions. They have all shocked me by the, violence which I should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of, any one of them. Their ethics are usually excellent. So are the ethics, of the common law of England. But the scheme of creation upon which, those ethics are built! Well, it really is to me the most astonishing, thing that I have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage, that so many, able men, deep philosophers, astute lawyers, and clear-headed men of, the world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life. In the, face of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not, dare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul, were it not that, I take courage when I reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and, philosophers of Rome and Greece were all agreed that Jupiter had, numerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine.\\n\\nThat was how, when I had gained some sort of opening, I set to work to, enlarge it. I joined this. I joined that. I pushed in every direction., I took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health, and found, that the practice benefited as well as I. My cricket form for the season, has been fair, with an average of about 20 with the bat and 9 with the, ball.\\n\\nThose whom I love best are those who have least sympathy with my, struggles. They talk about having faith, as if it could be done by an, act of volition. They might as well tell me to have black hair instead, of red. I might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all, in religious matters. But I will never be traitor to the highest thing, that God has given me. I WILL use it. It is more moral to use it and go, wrong, than to forego it and be right. It is only a little foot-rule\\n\\nBesides this decline in his practice, I was sorry to hear that, Cullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion, which had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits., His whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it, but as far, back as I can remember it had been a characteristic. Even in those, early days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocer's shop\\n\\nAgain, out of three shutters which belonged to the room, I rigged up a, very effective side-table for my own den, which when covered with a, red cloth, and ornamented with the bears' paws, might have cost twenty, guineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary. I had done, all this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow, which I shall have to tell you about, came upon me.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand me, and quote me as saying that it is a good thing, for a nation that it should have many drunkards. Nothing of the kind., What I say is, that if a nation has many morally weak people, then it, is good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains., Nature has her devices, and drink is among them. When there are no more, drunkards and reprobates, it means that the race is so advanced that it, no longer needs such rough treatment. Then the all-wise Engineer will, speed us along in some other fashion.\\n\\nWell, my dear Bertie, a happy and tranquil, if not very ambitious, existence stretches before us. We are both in our twenty-fifth year, and, I suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirty-five more, years lie in front of us. I can foresee the gradually increasing routine, of work, the wider circle of friends, the indentification with this or, that local movement, with perhaps a seat on the Bench, or at least, in the Municipal Council in my later years. It's not a very startling, programme, is it? But it lies to my hand, and I see no other. I should, dearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my, presence. Even on this small stage we have our two sides, and something, might be done by throwing all one's weight on the scale of breadth\\n\\nI am quite ashamed of having been so didactic. But it is fine to think, that sin may have an object and work towards good. My father says that, I seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property, and can't be, happy until I know that all is right with it. Well, it does send a, glow through me when I seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the, clouds.\\n\\n\\\"Well, he's been dead seven years, and fifty nets dipping into his, little fish-pond. However, when I passed I thought my best move was to, come down to the old place, and see whether I couldn't piece the thing, together again. The name ought to be worth something, I thought. But it, was no use doing the thing in a half hearted way. Not a bit of use in, that, Munro. The kind of people who came to him were wealthy, and must, see a fine house and a man in livery. What chance was there of gathering, them into a bow-windowed forty pound-a-year house with a grubby-faced, maid at the door? What do you suppose I did? My boy, I took the, governor's old house, that was unlet--the very house that he kept up at, five thousand a year. Off I started in rare style, and sank my last cent, in furniture. But it's no use, laddie. I can't hold on any longer. I, got two accidents and an epileptic--twenty-two pounds, eight and, sixpence--that's the lot!\\n\\nBut every movement has its crowd of camp followers, who straggle and, scatter. We are like a comet, bright at the head but tailing away into, mere gas behind. However, every man may speak for himself, and I do, not feel that your charge comes home to me. I am only bigoted against, bigotry, and that I hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent., When one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct, has had during the history of the world; the bitter wars, Christian and, Mahomedan, Catholic and Protestant; the persecutions, the torturings\\n\\nI had an adventure upon the way to Bradfield. The carriage in which, I was travelling contained a party of three, at whom I took the most, casual of glances before settling down to the daily paper. There was an, elderly lady, with a bright rosy face, gold spectacles, and a dash of, red velvet in her bonnet. With her were two younger people, who I took, to be her son and her daughter--the one a quiet, gentle-looking girl of, twenty or so, dressed in black, and the other a short, thick-set young, fellow, a year or two older. The two ladies sat by each other in the, far corner, and the son (as I presume him to be) sat opposite me. We may, have travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to, this little family party, save that I could not help hearing some talk, between the two ladies. The younger, who was addressed as Winnie, had\\n\\nThat was the first of my morning incidents. My second followed hard upon, the heels of it. Another ring came, and from my post of observation I, saw that a gipsy's van, hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs, had, drawn up at the door. Two or three people appeared to be standing, outside. I understood that they wished me to purchase some of their, wares, so I merely opened the door about three inches, said \\\"No, thank, you,\\\" and closed it. They seemed not to have heard me for they rang, again, upon which I opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly., Imagine my surprise when they rang again. I flung the door open, and was, about to ask them what they meant by their impudence, when one of the, little group upon my doorstep said, \\\"If you please, sir, it's the baby.\\\", Never was there such a change--from the outraged householder to the, professional man. \\\"Pray step in, madam,\\\" said I, in quite my most, courtly style; and in they all came--the husband, the brother, the wife, and the baby. The latter was in the early stage of measles. They were, poor outcast sort of people, and seemed not to have sixpence among them;, so my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in, my giving the medicine for nothing, and finally adding fivepence in, coppers, which was all the small change I had. A few more such patients, and I am a broken man.\\n\\nwith ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me, left, so jauntily by the tax-collector, and meaning such a dead-weight pull to, me. The irony of my paying a poor-rate used to amuse me. I should have, been collecting it. Thrice at a crisis I pawned my watch, and thrice I, rallied and rescued it. But how am I to interest you in the details of, such a career? Now, if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on, a piece of orange peel before my door, or if the chief merchant in the, town had been saved by some tour-de-force upon my part, or if I had, been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely, house with a princely fee for silence--then I should have something, worthy of your attention. But the long months and months during which, I listened to the throb of the charwoman's heart and the rustle of the, greengrocer's lungs, present little which is not dull and dreary. No, good angels came my way.\\n\\nMy chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke, and I assure you that, I was within an ace of going over. Down like a pack of cards came all my, dreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to, Avonmouth. Yes, Bertie, I am bound to confess it: my first thought was, of my own disappointment, and my second of the misfortune of my friends., He had the most diabolical intuitions, or I a very tell-tale face, for, he added at once--\\n\\n\\\"What is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound.\\\" He shoots off, a whole column of aphorisms in a single evening. I should like to have, a man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste. No; you, must not let me give you a false impression of the man's capacity., On the other hand, it would be dishonest to deny that I think him, thoroughly unscrupulous, and full of very sinister traits. I am much, mistaken, however, if he has not fine strata in his nature. He is, capable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths.\\n\\nWell, as I said, my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down, into the bulb, when on looking through the gathering gloom I saw, \\\"Merton\\\" printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station. I got out, and, was standing beside my trunk and my hat-box, waiting for a porter, when, up came a cheery-looking fellow and asked me whether I was Dr. Stark, Munro. \\\"I'm Horton,\\\" said he; and shook hands cordially.\\n\\n, My dear old chap, things have been happening, and I must tell you all, about it. Sympathy is a strange thing; for though I never see you, the, mere fact that you over there in New England are keenly interested in, what I am doing and thinking, makes my own life in old England very much, more interesting to me. The thought of you is like a good staff in my, right hand.\\n\\nAnd now I have worked my way to the point where I can show you what I, mean when I talk about fate. The medical practitioner who lives next, me--Porter is his name--is a kindly sort of man, and knowing that I have, had a long uphill fight, he has several times put things in my way., One day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after, breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"There you are!\\\" he would suddenly yell; \\\"see that man with a limp!, Every morning he goes. Displaced semilunar cartilage, and a three, months' job. The man's worth thirty-five shillings a week. And there!, I'm hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isn't round in, her bath-chair again. She's all sealskin and lactic acid. It's simply, sickening to see how they crowd to that man. And such a man! You haven't, seen him. All the better for you. I don't know what the devil you are, laughing at, Munro. I can't see where the fun comes in myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you frankly, old chap,\\\" said he, putting on suddenly that, sort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a, sneer in it. \\\"You see, many of my patients are simple country folk, half, imbecile for the most part, but then the half-crown of an imbecile is, as good as any other half-crown. They come to my door, and they see two, names, and their silly jaws begin to drop, and they say to each other\\n\\nHave you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts? We had one, in Cullingworth's practice just before his illness, and we were both, much excited about it. They seem to me to be one of those wee little, chinks through which one may see deep into Nature's workings. In this, case the fellow, who was a clerk in the post office, came to us with a, swelling over his eyebrow. We opened it under the impression that it was, an abscess, and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth, in it. You know that such cases are common enough in surgery, and that, no pathological museum is without an example.\\n\\nYes, Horton is a real right-down good fellow. His heart is broad and, kind and generous. There is nothing petty in the man. He loves to see, those around him happy; and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red, face goes far to make them so. Nature meant him to be a healer; for he, brightens up a sick room as he did the Merton station when first I set, eyes upon him. Don't imagine from my description that he is in any, way soft, however. There is no one on whom one could be less likely to, impose. He has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased., A mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into, the surgery like a whiff of cast wind, his checks red, his whiskers, bristling, and his eyes malignant. The daybook is banged, the bottles, rattled, the counter thumped, and then he is off again with five doors, slamming behind him. We can trace his progress when the black mood is on, him by those dwindling slams. Perhaps it is that McCarthy has labelled, the cough mixture as the eye-wash, or sent an empty pillbox with an, exhortation to take one every four hours. In any case the cyclone comes, and goes, and by the next meal all is peace once more.\\n\\nThis is all a digression, however, from the fact that I have been six, months at home and am weary of it, and pleased at the new development, of which I shall have to tell you. The practice here, although, unremunerative, is very busy with its three-and-sixpenny visits and, guinea confinements, so that both the governor and I have had plenty, to do. You know how I admire him, and yet I fear there is little, intellectual sympathy between us. He appears to think that those, opinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my, inmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado. So, I have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him, and, though we affect, to ignore it, we both know that there is a barrier there. Now, with my, mother--ah, but my mother must have a paragraph to herself.\\n\\nThe inside of the house was even huger than I had thought from the look, of the exterior. There were over thirty bedrooms, Cullingworth informed, me, as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs. The hall and first, stair were most excellently furnished and carpetted, but it all run, to nothing at the landing. My own bedroom had a little iron bed, and a, small basin standing on a packing case. Cullingworth took a hammer from, the mantelpiece, and began to knock in nails behind the door.\\n\\nShortly afterwards Jack went away to sea again; and after his departure, there were several furious quarrels between the women down below, which, filled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees. At last one, evening Miss Williams--the quiet one--came to me and announced with sobs, that she must go. Mrs. Wotton made her life unbearable, she said. She, was determined to be independent, and had fitted up a small shop in a, poor quarter of the town. She was going now, at once, to take possession, of it.\\n\\nAnd with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an, elemental religion. Come what may after death, our duties lie clearly, defined before us in this life; and the ethical standard of all creeds, agrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion, as to that. The last reformation simplified Catholicism. The coming one, will simplify Protestantism. And when the world is ripe for it another, will come and simplify that. The ever improving brain will give us an, ever broadening creed. Is it not glorious to think that evolution, is still living and acting--that if we have an anthropoid ape as an, ancestor, we may have archangels for our posterity?\\n\\n\\\"You believe far too much what James says,\\\" said she. \\\"You don't know, him in the least, Mr. Munro. You don't look at a thing from his point, of view, and you will never understand him until you do. It is not, of, course, that he means to say anything that is untrue; but his fancy is, excited, and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea, whether, it tells against himself or not. It hurts me, Mr. Munro, to see the, only man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship\\n\\nYou see by the address of this letter that I still hold my ground, but, between ourselves it has been a terrible fight, and there have been, times when that last plank of which old Whitehall wrote seemed to be, slipping out of my clutch. I have ebbed and flowed, sometimes with a, little money, sometimes without. At my best I was living hard, at my, worst I was very close upon starvation. I have lived for a whole day, upon the crust of a loaf, when I had ten pounds in silver in the drawer, of my table. But those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped, together for my quarter's rent, and I would have tried twenty-four hours, with a tight leather belt before I would have broken in upon it. For two, days I could not raise a stamp to send a letter. I have smiled when I, have read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in Egypt., Their broken victuals would have been a banquet to me. However, what, odds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen, as long as you DO, get it? The garrison of Oakley Villa has passed the worst, and there is, no talk of surrender.\\n\\nbeginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer, than friendship. You squeeze the slender arm which is passed through, yours, you venture to take the little gloved hand, you say good night, at absurd length in the shadow of the door. It is innocent and very, interesting, love trying his wings in a first little flutter. He will, keep his sustained flight later on, the better for the practice. There, was never any question of engagements between us, nor any suggestion of, harm. She knew that I was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects\\n\\n\\\"Because I know better. My boy, I'm a doctor's son, and I've seen too, much of it. I was born inside the machine, and I've seen all the wires., All this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of, the older men. It's to hold the young men back, and to stop the holes by, which they might slip through to the front. I've heard my father say so, a score of times. He had the largest practice in Scotland, and yet he, was absolutely devoid of brains. He slipped into it through seniority, and decorum. No pushing, but take your turn. Very well, laddie, when, you're at the top of the line, but how about it when you've just taken, your place at the tail? When I'm on the top rung I shall look down and, say, 'Now, you youngsters, we are going to have very strict etiquette\\n\\nand I had always defended him; but I was forced now to confess that she, had been right from the beginning. I said enough to show him that I, saw through his whole plot; and I wound up by assuring him that if he, thought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake; for I had, every reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the, very opening which I had most desired myself.\\n\\nand now I find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen;, so I am moving in the right direction. Of course, it compares absurdly, enough with Cullingworth's twenty pound a day, and my little quiet, back-water seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for, ever through his room. Still, I am quite satisfied, and I have no doubt, at all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first, year will be amply justified. It would be a pleasant thing to think that, if anything were really to happen at home, I should be able to be of, some use to them. If things go on as they have begun, I shall soon have, my feet firmly planted.\\n\\nThen I proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of, exploration. There were two upon the ground floor, sixteen feet square, each, and I saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair, condition. The front one would make a consulting room, the other a, waiting room, though I did not care to reflect who was most likely to do, the waiting. I was in the highest spirits, and did a step dance in each, room as an official inauguration.\\n\\nYou'll find my physiology even worse than my theology, Bertie. I have, a way of telling stories backwards to you, which is natural enough when, you consider that I always sit down to write under the influence of the, last impressions which have come upon me. All this talk about the soul, and the brain arises simply from the fact that I have been spending the, last few weeks with a lunatic. And how it came about I will tell you as, clearly as I can.\\n\\nNow, you will think me rather prolix about this man; but, as it looks, as if his life might become entwined with mine, it is a subject of, immediate interest to me, and I am writing all this for the purpose, of reviving my own half-faded impressions, as well as in the hope of, amusing and interesting you. So I must just give you one or two other, points which may make his character more clear to you.\\n\\nI had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases. One, (which was of immense importance to me) was that of a grocer named, Haywood, who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop. I was, passing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid. You may believe, that I saw my chance, bustled in, treated the man, conciliated the wife\\n\\nand he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast. The cooking, was to be done at a neighbouring confectioner's. The landlady's son, was coming in to wait. I was sorry to see that Whitehall was already, slurring his words together, and had evidently been priming himself, heavily. He looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time, we should have. So-and-so could talk well, and the other man could sing, a song. He was so far gone by now, that I ventured (in the capacity of, medical adviser) to speak to him about it.\\n\\nI was to go back to my father's that day, but I had a couple of hours, with Cullingworth in his consulting room before I left. He was in his, best form, and full of a hundred fantastic schemes, by which I was to, help him. His great object was to get his name into the newspapers. That, was the basis of all success, according to his views. It seemed to, me that he was confounding cause with effect; but I did not argue the, point. I laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions, which poured from him. I was to lie senseless in the roadway, and to be, carried into him by a sympathising crowd, while the footman ran with a, paragraph to the newspapers. But there was the likelihood that the, crowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite. In various, disguises I was to feign fits at his very door, and so furnish fresh, copy for the local press. Then I was to die--absolutely to expire--and, all Scotland was to resound with how Dr. Cullingworth, of Avonmouth, had, resuscitated me. His ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of, the idea, and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his, thoughts by the flood of half-serious devices.\\n\\nI daresay you've quite come to the conclusion by this time that, Cullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study--a man in the, first stage of lunacy or general paralysis. You might not be so sure, about it if you were in close contact with him. He justifies his wildest, flights by what he does. It sounds grotesque when put down in black and, white; but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he, had said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth. Now we, see that he has done it. His possibilities are immense. He has such, huge energy at the back of his fertility of invention. I am afraid, on, thinking over all that I have written to you, that I may have given you, a false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents, in which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character, and, omitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a, chance. His conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is, full of pith and idea. \\\"The greatest monument ever erected to Napoleon, Buonaparte was the British National debt,\\\" said he yesterday. Again\\n\\nthen, is he? He does not lie in the features which are to express his, emotions, nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the, blind and deaf. Nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over, which nature hangs her veil of flesh. In none of these things lies the, essence of the man. And now what is left? An arched whitish putty-like, mass, some fifty odd ounces in weight, with a number of white filaments, hanging down from it, looking not unlike the medusae which float in our, summer seas. But these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force, to muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes. They may, themselves therefore be disregarded. Nor can we stop here in our, elimination. This central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on, all sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul. Suicides, have shot away the front lobes of the brain, and have lived to repent, it. Surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections. Much of it, is merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion, and much, for the reception of impressions. All this may be put aside as we search, for the physical seat of what we call the soul--the spiritual part of, the man. And what is left then? A little blob of matter, a handful of, nervous dough, a few ounces of tissue, but there--somewhere there--lurks, that impalpable seed, to which the rest of our frame is but the pod. The, old philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right\\n\\nThen, there is her family pride. That is a very vital portion of the, mother. You know how little I think of such things. If the Esquire were, to be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name I should be, the lighter for it. But, ma foi!--to use her own favourite expletive--it, would not do to say this to her. On the Packenham side (she is a, Packenham) the family can boast of some fairly good men--I mean on the, direct line--but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch, upon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree. Not once, nor, twice, but thrice did the Plantagenets intermarry with us, the Dukes, of Brittany courted our alliance, and the Percies of Northumberland, intertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record. So in my, boyhood she would expound the matter, with hearthbrush in one hand and, a glove full of cinders in the other, while I would sit swinging my, knickerbockered legs, swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as, tight as a sausage skin, as I contemplated the gulf which separated me, from all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables. To this, day if I chance to do anything of which she strongly approves, the dear, heart can say no more than that I am a thorough Packenham; while if I, fall away from the straight path, she says with a sigh that there are, points in which I take after the Munros.\\n\\nBut, my goodness, where have I got to? All this comes from the, Birchespool lamp-posts and curb-stones. And I sat down to write such a, practical letter too! However, I give you leave to be as dogmatic and, didactic as you like in return. Cullingworth says my head is like a, bursting capsule, with all the seeds getting loose. Poor seed, too, I, fear, but some of it may lodge somewhere--or not, as Fate pleases.\\n\\ntherefore, and conveyed him to his home, I sitting with my most, professional air, and he standing straight up between my hands. The, carriage went at a walk, and the crowd trailed behind, with all the folk, looking out of the windows, so that a more glorious advertisement could, not be conceived. It looked like the advance guard of a circus. Once at, his house, however, professional etiquette demanded that I should hand, the case over to the family attendant, which I did with as good a grace, as possible--not without some lingering hope that the old established, practitioner might say, \\\"You have taken such very good care of my, patient, Dr. Munro, that I should not dream of removing him from your, hands.\\\" On the contrary, he snatched it away from me with avidity, and I, retired with some credit, an excellent advertisement, and a guinea.\\n\\nFor the next three days I had not a single ring at the bell of any sort, whatever. A man could not be more isolated from his kind. It used to, amuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passers-by stopped to, look at my plate. Once (on a Sunday morning) there were over a hundred, in an hour, and often I could see from their glancing over their, shoulders as they walked on, that they were thinking or talking of the, new doctor.\\n\\nMedical men, according to his view, have been afraid of producing a, poisonous effect with their drugs. With him, on the contrary, the, whole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning, and when the case, is serious, his remedies are heroic. Where, in epilepsy, I should have, given thirty-grain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours, he, would give two drachms every three. No doubt it will seem to you very, kill-or-cure, and I am myself afraid that a succession of coroners', inquests may check Cullingworth's career; but hitherto he has had no, public scandal, while the cases which he has brought back to life have, been numerous. He is the most fearless fellow. I have seen him pour, opium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled. But either his, knowledge or his luck always brings him out right.\\n\\nOne curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me., She is a stately looking widow, Turner by name, the most depressingly, respectable figure, as of Mrs. Grundy's older and less frivolous sister., She lives in a tiny house, with one small servant to scale. Well, every, two months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink, which lasts for, about a week. It ends as abruptly as it begins, but while it is on the, neighbours know it. She shrieks, yells, sings, chivies the servant\\n\\nBut in all soberness, I really do think, Bertie, that very much which, seems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it, properly. I tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink, and immorality. But physically, I fancy that it applies more obviously, than it does morally. All the physical evils of life seem to culminate, in death; and yet death, as I have seen it, has not been a painful or, terrible process. In many cases, a man dies without having incurred, nearly as much pain, during the whole of his fatal illness, as would, have arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw. And it is often, those deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker, which are least, so to the sufferer. When a man is overtaken by an express and shivered, into fragments, or when he drops from a fourth-floor window and, is smashed into a bag of splinters, the unfortunate spectators are, convulsed with horror, and find a text for pessimistic views about the, Providence which allows such things to be. And yet, it is very doubtful, whether the deceased, could his tongue be loosened, would remember, anything at all about the matter. We know, as students of medicine\\n\\nI said that the patients were very homely. Any one who is over-starched, might well come here to be unstiffened. I confess that I did not quite, fall in with it at once. When on one of my first mornings a club patient, with his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if I were the, doctor's man, I sent him on to see the groom in the stable. But soon one, falls into the humour of it. There is no offence meant; and why should, any be taken? They are kindly, generous folk; and if they pay no respect, to your profession in the abstract, and so rather hurt your dignity\\n\\n'There's two of 'em here. It's Dr. Cullingworth we want to see, but if, we go in we'll be shown as likely as not to Dr. Munro.' So it ends in, some cases in their not coming at all. Then there are the women. Women, don't care a toss whether you are a Solomon, or whether you are hot from, an asylum. It's all personal with them. You fetch them, or you don't, fetch them. I know how to work them, but they won't come if they think, they are going to be turned over to anybody else. That's what I put the, falling away down to.\\\"\\n\\nand man's form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine, we, walked amid the pealings of the \\\"Wedding March\\\" into the vestry, where, my dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the, register in the wrong place, so that to all appearance it was she who, had just married the clergyman. And then amid congratulations and kindly, faces, we were together, her hand on my forearm, upon the steps of the, church, and saw the familiar road stretching before us. But it was, not that road which lay before my eyes, but rather the path of our, lives;--that broader path on which our feet were now planted, so, pleasant to tread, and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist. Was, it long, or was it short? Was it uphill, or was it down? For her, at, least, it should be smooth, if a man's love could make it so.\\n\\n\\\"When the maid was arranging your room after your departure, she cleared, some pieces of torn paper from under the grate. Seeing my name upon, them, she brought them, as in duty bound, to her mistress, who pasted, them together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to, you, in which I am referred to in the vilest terms, such as 'a bankrupt, swindler' and 'the unscrupulous Cullingworth.' I can only say that we, are astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence, while you were a guest under our roof, and we refuse to have anything, more to do with you in any shape or form.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly, qualified medical men. The Cullingworths vanished away, and I never, heard any more of them, for he was a man who prided himself upon never, writing a letter. His father had formerly a very large and lucrative, practice in the West of Scotland, but he died some years ago. I had a, vague idea, founded upon some chance remark of his, that Cullingworth, had gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good, stead there. As for me I began, as you will remember that I explained, in my last, by acting as assistant in my father's practice. You know\\n\\nIt is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the, views of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive, and will wait, resignedly for what fate may send him. The objector forgets that among, the other things fated is that we of northern blood SHOULD strive and, should NOT sit down with folded hands. But when a man has striven, when, he has done all he knows, and when, in spite of it, a thing comes to, pass, let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune. It, is part of the main line of his destiny then, and is working to an end., A man loses his fortune; he gains earnestness. His eyesight goes; it, leads him to a spirituality. The girl loses her beauty; she becomes more, sympathetic. We think we are pushing our own way bravely, but there is a, great Hand in ours all the time.\\n\\nThe man who claims that we can know nothing is, to my mind, as, unreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely, revealed to us. I know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type, of scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know, but has not, imagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of, doubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance., He is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws\\n\\nLook at it in this way. We know that many of the permanent facts of the, universe are NOT chance. It is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing, clear of each other, that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which, will drift it to a congenial soil, that the creature is adapted to its, environment. Show me a whale with its great-coat of fat, and I want no, further proof of design. But logically, as it seems to me, ALL must be, design, or all must be chance. I do not see how one can slash a line, right across the universe, and say that all to the right of that is, chance, and all to the left is pre-ordained. You would then have to, contend that things which on the face of them are of the same class, are, really divided by an impassable gulf, and that the lower are regulated\\n\\nI tell you these trivial matters, my dear Bertie, just to show you that, I am not down on my luck, and that my life is not pitched in the minor, key altogether, in spite of my queer situation. But, to turn to graver, things: I was right glad to get your letter, and to read all your, denunciations about dogmatic science. Don't imagine that my withers are, wrung by what you say, for I agree with almost every word of it.\\n\\nThe moment I looked him in the face I smelled mischief. He had a gleam, of settled malice in his eye. I believe it was my refusal to back his, paper which was running in his head. Anyway he looked as dangerous as he, could look, with his scowling face sunk forward a little, his hands, down near his hips (for his boxing, like everything else about him, is, unconventional), and his jaw set like a rat-trap.\\n\\nVery sober to outward seeming, but in a frenzy within, he went down to, the station one night, and, stooping to the pigeon-hole, he asked the, ticket-clerk, in the suavest voice, whether he could tell him how far, it was to London. The official put forward his face to reply when, Cullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a, piston. The clerk flew backwards off his stool, and his yell of pain and, indignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance., They pursued Cullingworth; but he, as active and as fit as a greyhound\\n\\nSo there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices, and wonderful introductions! I believe the only person in the whole, house who regretted me was Jimmy, who was quite downcast at the news., His grief, however, did not prevent him from brushing my new top-hat, the wrong way on the morning that I left. I did not notice it until I, reached the station, and a most undignified object I must have looked, when I took my departure.\\n\\nI ask myself, where is the man, the very, very inmost essence of the, man? See how much you may subtract from him without touching it. It does, not lie in the limbs which serve him as tools, nor in the apparatus by, which he is to digest, nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen. All, these are mere accessories, the slaves of the lord within. Where\\n\\ncataracts, iritis, refractions, what you like; here's the great Signor, Cullingworth, right up to date and ready for anything!' In they come of, course, droves of them, and then I arrive and take the money. Here's, my luggage!\\\" he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room., \\\"Those are glasses, my boy, concave and convex, hundreds of them. I test, an eye, fit him on the spot, and send him away shouting. Then I load, up a steamer and come home, unless I elect to buy one of their little, States and run it.\\\"\\n\\nYou will wonder, perhaps, how we get on--my wife and I--in the matter, of religion. Well, we both go our own ways. Why should I proselytise? I, would not for the sake of abstract truth take away her child-like faith, which serves to make life easier and brighter to her. I have made myself, ill-understood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in, them any bitterness against the orthodox creeds. Far from saying that, they are all false, it would express my position better to say that they, are all true. Providence would not have used them were they not the best, available tools, and in that sense divine. That they are final I deny. A, simpler and more universal creed will take their place, when the mind of, man is ready for it; and I believe it will be a creed founded upon those, lines of absolute and provable truth which I have indicated. But the old, creeds are still the best suited to certain minds, and to certain ages., If they are good enough for Providence to use, they are good enough for, us to endure. We have but to wait upon the survival of the truest. If I, have seemed to say anything aggressive against them, it was directed, at those who wish to limit the Almighty's favour to their own little, clique, or who wish to build a Chinese wall round religion, with no, assimilation of fresh truths, and no hope of expansion in the future. It, is with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce. As for my, wife, I would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers, as, she would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table., She is not narrow in her views; but if one could stand upon the very, topmost pinnacle of broad-mindedness, one would doubtless see from it, that even the narrow have their mission.\\n\\nonly I may have been a little more emphatic. \\\"Pain in the jaw,\\\" said he., \\\"You needn't make such a noise,\\\" said I; \\\"other people are ill besides, you.\\\" \\\"If I pay my money, young man, I'll make such noise as I like.\\\", And actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door., He would have gone on with his devil's tattoo all morning if I had not, led him down the path and seen him off the premises. An hour afterwards, Horton whirled into the surgery, with a trail of banged doors behind, him. \\\"What's this about Mr. Usher, Munro?\\\" he asked. \\\"He says that you, were violent towards him.\\\" \\\"There was a club patient here who kept on, banging the knocker,\\\" said I; \\\"I was afraid that he would disturb Mrs., White, and so I made him stop.\\\" Horton's eyes began to twinkle. \\\"My, boy,\\\" said he, \\\"that club patient, as you call him, is the richest man, in Merton, and worth a hundred a year to me.\\\" I have no doubt that he, appeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation; but I have not, heard anything of the matter since.\\n\\nthat there was no getting away from him. He was on me once more with, a regular football rush that knocked me off my balance. Before I knew, where I was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear. I, tripped over a footstool, and then before I could get my balance he had, me on the same ear again, and my head was singing like a tea-kettle., He was as pleased as possible with himself, blowing out his chest and, slapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the, room.\\n\\n\\\"By God, Dr. Munro, sir, I'm the man that's going to stick to you. I'm, only an old sailor-man, sir, with perhaps more liquor than sense; but, I'm the Queen's servant, and touch my pension every quarter day. I, don't claim to be R. N., but I'm not merchant service either. Here I, am, rotting in lodgings, but by ----, Dr. Munro, sir, I carried seven, thousand stinking Turks from Varna to Balaclava Bay. I'm with you, Dr., Munro, and we put this thing through together.\\\"\\n\\nwhen only a senior midshipman, lost the sight of one eye and the use of, one arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable Pah in, the Maori war. The other was a sad-faced poetical-looking man, of, good birth as I understood, who had been disowned by his family on the, occasion of his eloping with the cook. His name was Carr, and his chief, peculiarity, that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could, always tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in., He would cock his head, think over his own symptoms, and then give, you the hour fairly correctly. An unusual drink would disarrange him\\n\\nI led off, and then in he came hitting with both hands, and grunting, like a pig at every blow. From what I could see of him he was no boxer, at all, but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter. I was guarding, with both hands for half a minute, and then was rushed clean off my legs, and banged up against the door, with my head nearly through one of the, panels. He wouldn't stop then, though he saw that I had no space to get, my elbows back; and he let fly a right-hander which would have put me, into the hall, if I hadn't slipped it and got back to the middle of the, room.\\n\\nFred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time. I, gave him his usual dose last thing at night; and then, as he seemed to, be sleeping peacefully, I went to my own room for the rest which I badly, needed. I did not wake until eight in the morning, when I was roused, by the jingling of a spoon in a saucer, and the step of Miss Williams, passing my door. She was taking him the arrowroot which I had ordered, over-night. I heard her open the door, and the next moment my heart, sprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream, and her cup and saucer, crashed upon the floor. An instant later she had burst into my room\\n\\nand all these bodies for? Eh, laddie? For encouraging the best interests, of the profession. Do you suppose they do that by making the, population healthy? It's about time we had a mutiny among the general, practitioners. If I had the use of half the funds which the Association, has, I should spend part of them in drain-blocking, and the rest in the, cultivation of disease germs, and the contamination of drinking water.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we came down to the dining-room for supper, Mrs. Cullingworth was, waiting there to greet me. I was sorry to see that she was pale and, weary-looking. However, we had a merry meal in the old style, and her, husband's animation reflected itself upon her face, until at last we, might have been back in the little room, where the Medical Journals, served as a chair, instead of in the great oak-furnished, picture-hung, chamber to which we had been promoted. All the time, however, not one, word as to the object of my journey.\\n\\nWhen I came back I settled down once more to the routine of my father's, practice, holding on there until something may turn up. And for six, months I have had to wait; a weary six months they have been. You see I, cannot ask my father for money--or, at least, I cannot bring myself to, take an unnecessary penny of his money--for I know how hard a fight, it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest, little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose, is to a tailor. Foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of, guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury! We can just hold, on, and I would not have him a pound the poorer for me. But you can, understand, Bertie, that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have, to go about without any money in my pocket. It affects me in so many, petty ways. A poor man may do me a kindness, and I have to seem mean in, his eyes. I may want a flower for a girl, and must be content to appear, ungallant. I don't know why I should be ashamed of this, since it is no, fault of mine, and I hope that I don't show it to any one else that I AM, ashamed of it; but to you, my dear Bertie, I don't mind confessing that, it hurts my self-respect terribly.\\n\\nAfter this bit of bravado I felt better, and I thought over the, situation. I was alone in a strange town, without connections, without, introductions, with less than a pound in my pocket, and with no, possibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities. I had no one at, all to look to for help, for all my recent letters from home had given a, dreary account of the state of things there. My poor father's health and, his income were dwindling together. On the other hand, I reflected that, there were some points in my favour. I was young. I was energetic. I had, been brought up hard, and was quite prepared to rough it. I was well up, in my work, and believed I could get on with patients. My house was an, excellent one for my purpose, and I had already put the essentials of, furniture into it. The game was not played out yet. I jumped to my feet, and clenched my hand, and swore to the chandelier that it never should, be played out until I had to beckon for help from the window.\\n\\nRound he came, and very helpful he was. He seemed to know all about the, procedure--\\\"Buried two wives, Dr. Munro, sir!\\\" I signed the certificate, myself, conveyed it to the registrar, got the order for burial, took, it round to the parish clerk, arranged an hour, then off to the, undertaker's, and back to my practice. It was a kind of nightmare, morning to look back upon, relieved only by the figure of my old, Bohemian, with his pea jacket, his black thorn, his puffy, crinkly face\\n\\nthat he should not say one word about his phenomenal success here--of, which I am naturally most anxious to hear--not a word either upon the, important subject of our partnership, but will think and talk of nothing, but this extraordinary naval idea. In a week he will have tossed it, aside in all probability, and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the, Jews and settling them in Madagascar. Yet from all he has said, and all, I have seen, there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way, made a tremendous hit, and to-morrow I shall let you know all about, it. Come what may, I am delighted that I came, for things promise to be, interesting. Regard this not as the end of a letter, but of a paragraph., You shall have the conclusion to-morrow, or on Thursday at the latest., Goodbye, and my remembrance to Lawrence if you see him. How's your, friend from Yale?\\n\\nOne day we went to the Central Hotel billiard-room in the evening to, play a match. Our form is just about the same, and we should have bad an, enjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his. He had, been in a sullen humour the whole day, pretending not to hear what, I said to him, or else giving snappy answers, and looking like a, thunder-cloud. I was determined not to have a row, so I took no notice, at all of his continual provocations, which, instead of pacifying him\\n\\nI think that I mentioned, when I gave you a short sketch of my dear old, mother, that she has a very high standard of family honour. She really, tries to live up to the Percy-Plantagenet blend which is said to flow, in our veins; and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her, from sailing through life, like the grande dame that she is, throwing, largesse to right and left, with her head in the air and her soul in the, clouds. I have often heard her say (and I am quite convinced that she, meant it) that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves, than know that we had committed a dishonourable action. Yes; for all her, softness and femininity, she could freeze iron-hard at the suspicion of, baseness; and I have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace, collar when she has heard of an act of meanness.\\n\\nThere was no need of three insertions. One would have been ample. Within, half an hour of the appearance of the first edition, I had an applicant, at the end of my bell-wire, and for the remainder of the evening Paul, was ushering them in and I interviewing them with hardly a break. I, should have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat;, but as we saw the demand increase, our conditions went up and up;, white aprons, proper dress for answering door, doing beds and boots\\n\\nHowever, I had not quite got to the end of Whitehall's visit yet. When, I went back I took down the beautiful lava jug, and inside I found his, card. On the back was written, \\\"You have gone into action, sir. It may, be your fate to sink or to swim, but it can never be your degradation, to strike. Die on the last plank and be damned to you, or come into port, with your ensign flying mast-high.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you this, Bertie, because if I put reason above emotion I would, not have you think that I am not open to attacks of the latter also., I feel that what I say about religion is too cold and academic. I feel, that there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting., But if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a, thing to be true, which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out, against, then you are selling your opiates too high. I'm a volunteer for, \\\"God's own forlorn hope,\\\" and I'll clamber up the breech as long as I, think I can see the flag of truth waving in front of me.\\n\\nthe man whom they were after, running at the top of his speed in their, direction. His little peculiarity had asserted itself, you see, and, he had unconsciously turned in his flight. They tripped him up, flung, themselves upon him, and after a long and desperate struggle dragged, him to the police station. He was charged before the magistrate next, morning, but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own, defence that he carried the Court with him, and escaped with a nominal, fine. At his invitation, the witnesses and the police trooped after, him to the nearest hotel, and the affair ended in universal, whisky-and-sodas.\\n\\na sitting-room, and a fourth room, which Cullingworth insisted upon, regarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease, though, I am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from, below which had given him the idea. At any rate, with his usual energy, he had not only locked the room up, but had gummed varnished paper over, all the cracks of the door, to prevent the imaginary contagion from, spreading. The furniture was the sparest possible. There were, I, remember, only two chairs in the sitting-room; so that when a guest came, (and I think I was the only one) Cullingworth used to squat upon a pile, of yearly volumes of the British Medical Journal in the corner. I can, see him now levering himself up from his lowly seat, and striding about, the room roaring and striking with his hands, while his little wife, sat mum in the corner, listening to him with love and admiration in her, eyes. What did we care, any one of the three of us, where we sat or how, we lived, when youth throbbed hot in our veins, and our souls were all, aflame with the possibilities of life? I still look upon those Bohemian, evenings, in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese, as being among, the happiest that I have known.\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to have any doctoring it must come from you, laddie,\\\" he said;, \\\"for if I was to turn my toes up in the public square, there's not a man, here who would do more than sign my certificate. By Crums, they might, get the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me, for, there's no love lost between us. But I want to go down to the practice, all the same.\\\"\\n\\nYou see, it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first, appearance in Birchespool was not in the dock of the police-court. I, should have had no one to answer for me, if I had been arrested, and, should have been put quite on a level with my adversary. I daresay you, think I made a great fool of myself, but I should like to know how, I could have acted otherwise. The only thing that I feel now is my, loneliness. What a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child!\\n\\nI was a frequent visitor to the Cullingworths, for the pleasure that I, got was made the sweeter by the pleasure which I hoped that I gave. They, knew no one, and desired to know no one; so that socially I seemed to be, the only link that bound them to the world. I even ventured to interfere, in the details of their little menage. Cullingworth had a fad at the, time, that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment, of the open-air life of our ancestors, and as a corollary he kept his, windows open day and night. As his wife was obviously fragile, and yet, would have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint, I, took it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she, suffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a, draught. He scowled savagely at me for my interference; and I thought, we were on the verge of a quarrel, but it blew over, and he became more, considerate in the matter of ventilation.\\n\\n, You write reproachfully, my dear Bertie, and you say that absence must, have weakened our close friendship, since I have not sent you a line, during this long seven months. The real truth of the matter is that, I had not the heart to write to you until I could tell you something, cheery; and something cheery has been terribly long in coming. At, present I can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at, the edges.\\n\\ntogether with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among, the ancient Londoners. Several examples of these metallic cylinders, or tubings were on exhibition in the hall, and were passed round for, inspection among the audience. The learned lecturer prefaced his remarks, by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which, separated them from the days when London was a flourishing city, it, behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might, come as to the habits of the inhabitants. Recent research appeared to, have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall, of London was somewhat later than that of the erection of the Egyptian, Pyramids. A large building had recently been unearthed near the dried-up, bed of the river Thames; and there could be no question from existing, records that this was the seat of the law-making council among the, ancient Britons--or Anglicans, as they were sometimes called. The, lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the Thames had been, tunnelled under by a monarch named Brunel, who is supposed by some, authorities to have succeeded Alfred the Great. The open spaces of, London, he went on to remark, must have been far from safe, as the, bones of lions, tigers, and other extinct forms of carnivora had, been discovered in the Regent's Park. Having briefly referred to the, mysterious structures known as 'pillar-boxes,' which are scattered, thickly over the city, and which are either religious in their origin\\n\\nAfter all, I see more and more clearly that both men and women are, incomplete, fragmentary, mutilated creatures, as long as they are, single. Do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is, the happiest, they are still full of vague unrests, of dim, ill-defined, dissatisfactions, of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts., Alone each is a half-made being, with every instinct and feeling, yearning for its missing moiety. Together they form a complete and, symmetrical whole, the minds of each strongest where that of the other, needs reinforcing. I often think that if our souls survive death (and I, believe they do, though I base my believe on very different grounds from, yours), every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined, with it, to round it off and give it symmetry. So thought the old, Mormon, you remember, who used it as an argument for his creed. \\\"You, cannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you,\\\" he said., \\\"But with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the, world to come.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that I must, tell you of it. Cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel, darts. With this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet, the, length of the back room. We were shooting at a mark after dinner, when, he asked me whether I would hold a halfpenny between my finger and, thumb, and allow him to shoot it out. A halfpenny not being forthcoming\\n\\nits dogmatism about what seems to be false, its conflict with what we, know to be true. We KNOW that man has ascended, not descended; so what, is the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition, of his fall? We KNOW that the world was not made in six days, that the, sun could never be stopped since it was never moving, and that no man, ever lived three days in a fish; so what becomes of the inspiration of a, book which contains such statements? \\\"Truth, though it crush me!\\\"\\n\\nThe room was a large bare one, at the end of a long corridor. Near the, door was seated a footman, placed there to fill up the gap between two, doctors, and looking considerably relieved at my advent. Over by the, window (which was furnished with a wooden guard, like that of a nursery), sat a tall, yellow-haired, yellow-bearded, young man, who raised a pair, of startled blue eyes as we entered. He was turning over the pages of a, bound copy of the Illustrated London News.\\n\\nI had enough to make a man serious before, when I had to face the world, without money or interest. But now to think of the mother and my sisters, and little Paul all leaning upon me when I cannot stand myself--it is, a nightmare. Could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have, those whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it?, But perhaps it won't come to that. Perhaps my father may hold his, own for years. Come what may, I am bound to think that all things are, ordered for the best; though when the good is a furlong off, and we with, our beetle eyes can only see three inches, it takes some confidence in, general principles to pull us through.\\n\\n\\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo Player,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle,\\\" for five shillings;, a tiny fender, half-a-crown; a toilet set, five shillings; another, very small square-topped table, three and sixpence. Whenever I bid, for anything, Whitehall thrust his black-thorn up into the air, and, presently I found him doing so on my behalf when I had no intention of, buying. I narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a, stuffed macaw in a glass case.\\n\\nIt was about four in the afternoon when I reached Birchespool, which, is fifty-three miles by rail from Bradfield. It may be merely a name to, you, and, indeed, until I set foot in it I knew nothing of it myself;, but I can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and, thirty thousand souls (about the same as Bradfield), that it is mildly, manufacturing, that it is within an hour's journey of the sea, that it, has an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well, and that the, country round is exceedingly beautiful. It is small enough to have a, character of its own, and large enough for solitude, which is always the, great charm of a city, after the offensive publicity of the country.\\n\\nThis was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd. The folk, behind, wishing to see all that was going on, pushed against those in, front, until half-a-dozen of the foremost (with, I think, a woman among, them) were flung right up against us. One of these, a rough, sailor-like, fellow in a jersey, got wedged between us; and my antagonist, in his, blind rage, got one of his swinging blows home upon this new-comer's, ear. \\\"What, you----!\\\" yelled the sailor; and in an instant he had taken, over the whole contract, and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty., I grabbed my stick, which had fallen among the crowd, and backed my way, out, rather dishevelled, but very glad to get off so cheaply. From the, shouting which I could hear some time after I reached the door of my, lodgings, I gathered that a good battle was still raging.\\n\\nwe won't leave a doctor in it. It's all they can do now to get butter, to their bread; and when we get to work together they'll have to eat it, dry. Listen to me, my boy! There are a hundred and twenty thousand folk, in this town, all shrieking for advice, and there isn't a doctor who, knows a rhubarb pill from a calculus. Man, we only have to gather them, in. I stand and take the money until my arm aches.\\\"\\n\\nWell, when I had finished my empty-house-and-doctor chart, I found that, there was one villa to let, which undoubtedly was far the most suitable, for my purpose. In the first place it was fairly cheap-forty pounds, or, fifty with taxes. The front looked well. It had no garden. It stood with, the well-to-do quarter upon the one side, and the poorer upon the other., Finally, it was almost at the intersection of four roads, one of which, was a main artery of the town. Altogether, if I had ordered a house for, my purpose I could hardly have got anything better, and I was thrilled, with apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent. I, hurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather, startled the demure clerk inside.\\n\\nMy father took the news philosophically enough, with some rather, sardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep, each other company. But to my mother it was a flash of joy, followed by, a thunderclap of consternation. I had only three under-shirts, the, best of my linen had gone to Belfast to be refronted and recuffed, the, night-gowns were not marked yet--there were a dozen of those domestic, difficulties of which the mere male never thinks. A dreadful vision of, Lady Saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of, my socks obsessed my mother. Out we trudged together, and before evening, her soul was at rest, and I had mortgaged in advance my first month's, salary. She was great, as we walked home, upon the grand people into, whose service I was to enter. \\\"As a matter of fact, my dear,\\\" said she\\n\\nWe used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors; and, there we made a curious quartette: Jimmy (as he wished me to call him), glum and silent; I with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him;, Lady Saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins; and the, good-natured peer, fussy and genial, but always rather subdued in the, presence of his wife. She looked as if a glass of good wine would do, her good, and he as if he would be the better for abstinence; and so, in, accordance with the usual lopsidedness of life, he drank freely, and, she took nothing but lime-juice and water. You cannot imagine a more, ignorant, intolerant, narrow-minded woman than she. If she had only been, content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers, it would, not have mattered; but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating, clacking. What was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease, from one generation to another? She was bounded by insanity upon the, north and upon the south. I resolutely set myself to avoid all argument, with her; but she knew, with her woman's instinct, that we were as far, apart as the poles, and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before, me. One day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an, Episcopal church performing any service in a Presbyterian chapel. Some, neighbouring minister had done it, it seems; and if he had been marked, down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing., I suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue, for she, suddenly turned upon me with:\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, holding out a twitching hand., \\\"I compliment you, sir! You look fresh, ---- fresh, and me with a head, like a toy-shop. We had a pleasant, quiet evening, and I took nothing to, hurt, but it is the ---- relaxing air of this place that settles me. I, can't bear up against it. Last year it gave me the horrors, and I expect, it will again. You're off house-hunting, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\nand calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as, to his position. The good people were so touched by the picture that, he drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them, wept, and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their, bills stand over, but even some talk of a collection then and there to, help Cullingworth on his way. He has, I understand, left Avonmouth, but, no one has any idea what has become of him. It is generally supposed, that he has gone to England. He is a strange fellow, but I wish him luck, wherever he goes.\\n\\nI never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life. He used, language of self-reproach which would have been extravagant if he had, shot off one of my limbs. Our positions were absurdly reversed; and it, was he who sat collapsed in a chair, while it was I, with the dart, still in my finger, who leaned over him and laughed the matter off. Mrs., Cullingworth had run for hot water, and presently with a tweezers we, got the intruder out. There was very little pain (more to-day than, yesterday), but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may, look for a star at the end of my right forefinger.\\n\\nAnd then there came another and a more serious accident. This would be, about two months after the beginning, though already I find it hard to, put things in their due order. A lawyer in the town named Dickson was, riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him. I was, eating saveloys in the back room at the time, but I heard the noise and, rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in., They flooded into my house, thronged my hall, dirtied my consulting, room, and even pushed their way into my back room, which they found, elegantly furnished with a portmanteau, a lump of bread, and a cold, sausage.\\n\\nI had plenty of time on my way to Birchespool to reflect upon my, prospects and present situation. My baggage consisted of a large, brassplate, a small leather trunk, and a hat-box. The plate with my name, engraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head. In my box, were a stethoscope, several medical books, a second pair of boots, two, suits of clothes, my linen and my toilet things. With this, and the five, pounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse, I was sallying out, to clear standing-room, and win the right to live from my fellow-men., But at least there was some chance of permanency about this; and if, there was the promise of poverty and hardship, there was also that of, freedom. I should have no Lady Saltire to toss up her chin because I had, my own view of things, no Cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing. I, would be my own--my very own. I capered up and down the carriage at the, thought. After all, I had everything to gain and nothing in the whole, wide world to lose. And I had youth and strength and energy, and the, whole science of medicine packed in between my two ears. I felt as, exultant as though I were going to take over some practice which lay, ready for me.\\n\\nThe Cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return. There was, a singular look upon both their faces which seemed to ME to mean that, they were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me. When I think, of their absolute geniality a few days ago, and their markedly reserved, manner now, I can make no sense out of it. I asked Cullingworth point, blank what it meant, but he only turned it off with a forced laugh, and, some nonsense about my thin skin. I think that I am the last man in the, world to take offence where none is meant; but at any rate I determined, to end the matter by leaving Bradfield at once. It had struck me, during, my journey back from Stockwell, that Birchespool would be a good place;, so on the very next day I started off, taking my luggage with me, and, bidding a final good-bye to Cullingworth and his wife.\\n\\nWe were away for several weeks in the Isle of Man, and then came back, to Oakley Villa, where Miss Williams was awaiting us in a house in which, even my mother could have found no dust, and with a series of cheering, legends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my, absence. There really was a marked increase in my practice; and for the, last six months or so, without being actually busy, I have always had, enough to occupy me. My people are poor, and I have to work hard for a, small fee; but I still study and attend the local hospital, and keep my, knowledge up-to-date, so as to be ready for my opening when it comes., There are times when I chafe that I may not play a part upon some, larger stage than this; but my happiness is complete, and if fate has, no further use for me, I am content now from my heart to live and to die, where I am.\\n\\nTalking about horses, we had no end of a fuss here the other day., Cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a first-class riding, horse; and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him, he, commissioned a horse dealer to get him one. The man told us of a charger, which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of. He, did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was, because he considered it to be dangerous; but, he added, that Captain, Lucas had given L150 for it, and was prepared to sell it at seventy., This excited Cullingworth, and he ordered the creature to be saddled and, brought round. It was a beautiful animal, coal black, with a magnificent, neck and shoulders, but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears, and an, unpleasant way of looking at you. The horse dealer said that our yard, was too small to try the creature in; but Cullingworth clambered up upon, its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the, ears with the bone handle of his whip. Then ensued one of the most, lively ten minutes that I can remember. The beast justified his, reputation; but Cullingworth, although he was no horseman, stuck to him, like a limpet. Backwards, forwards, sideways, on his fore feet, on, his hind feet, with his back curved, with his back sunk, bucking and, kicking, there was nothing the creature did not try. Cullingworth was, sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail--never by, any chance in the saddle--he had lost both stirrups, and his knees were, drawn up and his heels dug into the creature's ribs, while his hands, clawed at mane, saddle, or ears, whichever he saw in front of him. He, kept his whip, however; and whenever the brute eased down, Cullingworth, lammed him once more with the bone handle. His idea, I suppose, was to, break its spirit, but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry, through. The animal bunched his four feet together, ducked down his, head, arched his back like a yawning cat, and gave three convulsive, springs into the air. At the first, Cullingworth's knees were above the, saddle flaps, at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive, grip, at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling, narrowly, missed the coping of the wall, broke with his head the iron bar which, held some wire netting, and toppled back with a thud into the yard. Up, he bounded with the blood streaming down his face, and running into our, half-finished stables he seized a hatchet, and with a bellow of, rage rushed at the horse. I caught him by the coat and put on a, fourteen-stone drag, while the horse dealer (who was as white as a, cheese) ran off with his horse into the street. Cullingworth broke away, from my grip, and cursing incoherently, his face slobbered with blood\\n\\nBut how do I know what is truth, you ask? I don't. But I know, particularly well what isn't. And surely that is something to have, gained. It isn't true that the great central Mind that planned all, things is capable of jealousy or of revenge, or of cruelty or of, injustice. These are human attributes; and the book which ascribes, them to the Infinite must be human also. It isn't true that the laws of, Nature have been capriciously disturbed, that snakes have talked, that, women have been turned to salt, that rods have brought water out of, rocks. You must in honesty confess that if these things were presented, to us when we were, adults for the first time, we should smile at them., It isn't true that the Fountain of all common sense should punish a race, for a venial offence committed by a person long since dead, and then, should add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon, a single innocent scapegoat. Can you not see all the want of justice, and logic, to say nothing of the want of mercy, involved in such a, conception? Can you not see it, Bertie? How can you blind yourself to, it! Take your eyes away from the details for a moment, and look at this, root idea of the predominant Faith. Is the general conception of it, consistent with infinite wisdom and mercy? If not, what becomes of the, dogmas, the sacraments, the whole scheme which is founded upon this, sand-bank? Courage, my friend! At the right moment all will be laid, aside, as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which, has been a good friend to him in his weakness. But his changes won't be, over then. His hobble will become a walk, and his walk a run. There is, no finality--CAN be none since the question concerns the infinite. All, this, which appears too advanced to you to-day, will seem reactionary, and conservative a thousand years hence.\\n\\nWhen I woke in the morning, and looked round at the bare walls and the, basin on the packing case, I hardly knew where I was. Cullingworth came, charging into the room in his dressing gown, however, and roused me, effectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed, and, throwing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow, with a thud. He was in great spirits, and, squatting on the bed, he held, forth about his plans while I dressed.\\n\\nand I spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to, celebrate the occasion. Old Cullingworth has always had a very high, opinion of lunatics for beginners. \\\"Get a lunatic, my boy! Get a, lunatic!\\\" he used to say. Then it was not only the situation, but the, fine connection that it opened up. I seemed to see exactly what would, happen. There would be illness in the family,--Lord Saltire himself, perhaps, or his wife. There would be no time to send for advice. I would, be consulted. I would gain their confidence and become their family, attendant. They would recommend me to their wealthy friends. It was all, as clear as possible. I was debating before I reached home whether it, would be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order, to take the Professorship which might be offered me.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"If you are so anxious to make a business matter, of it, you can arrange it so.\\\" I could not make out, and cannot make out, now, what had happened to freeze them up so; but I supposed that they, had been talking it over, and came to the conclusion that I was settling, down too much upon the old lines, and that they must remind me that I, was under orders to quit. They might have done it with more tact.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the more human traits--'weak' is hardly the word I should have, used. His rebuke of the Sabbatarians, His personal violence to the, hucksters, His outbursts against the Pharisees, His rather unreasoning, petulance against the fig-tree because it bore no fruit at the wrong, season of the year, His very human feeling towards the housewife who, bustled about when He was talking, his gratification that the ointment, should have been used for Him instead of being devoted to the poor\\n\\nI have told you this trivial little scene, Bertie, to show the strange, way in which Cullingworth springs quarrels upon me; suddenly, without, the slightest possible provocation, taking a most offensive tone, and, then when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance, turning, the whole thing to chaff. This has occurred again and again recently;, and, when coupled with the change in Mrs. Cullingworth's demeanour\\n\\nAs to old Cullingworth, he is booming along as merrily as ever. You say, in your last, that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of, the public in so short a time. That is just the point which I have found, it hard to get light upon. He told me that after his first coming he had, not a patient for a month, and that he was so disheartened that he very, nearly made a moonlight exodus. At last, however, a few cases came his, way--and he made such extraordinary cures of them, or else impressed, them so by his eccentricity, that they would do nothing but talk of him., Some of his wonderful results got into the local press, though, after, my Avonmouth experience, I should not like to guarantee that he did not, himself convey them there. He showed me an almanac, which had a great, circulation in the district.\\n\\nBut--there is a great big \\\"but\\\" in the case. You must ride yourself on, the curb the whole time. Unless you are sure--absolutely sure--that you, can do this, you are far best at home. You must never for one instant, forget yourself. You must remember what your object is in being there., You must inspire respect. Be friendly, genial, convivial--what you, will--but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman. If you can make, yourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that, you join a fresh introduction to practice. But beware of drink! Above, everything, beware of drink! The company that you are in may condone, it in each other, but never in the man who wishes them to commit their, lives to his safe keeping. A slip is fatal--a half slip perilous. Make, your rule of life and go by it, in spite of challenge or coaxers. It, will be remembered in your favour next morning.\\n\\nWhen first I came out of the faith in which I had been reared, I, certainly did feel for a time as if my life-belt had burst. I won't, exaggerate and say that I was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual, darkness. Youth is too full of action for that. But I was conscious of a, vague unrest, of a constant want of repose, of an emptiness and hardness, which I had not noticed in life before. I had so identified religion, with the Bible that I could not conceive them apart. When the foundation, proved false, the whole structure came rattling about my ears. And then, good old Carlyle came to the rescue; and partly from him, and partly, from my own broodings, I made a little hut of my own, which has kept me, snug ever since, and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides.\\n\\nfull of every lofty aspiration, and that a gross physical cause, such, as the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on, to the surface of the membrane which covers his brain, may have the, ultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every, bestial attribute! That a man's individuality should swing round, from pole to pole, and yet that one life should contain these two, contradictory personalities--is it not a wondrous thing?\\n\\nSmeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some, one is conspiring to poison him with copper, against which he takes the, most extravagant precautions. It is the strangest sight, he says, to, see Cullingworth at his meals; for he sits with an elaborate chemical, apparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow, with which he, tests samples of every course. I could not help laughing at Smeaton's, description, and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it. Of all, ruins, that of a fine man is the saddest.\\n\\ncooking,--we became more and more exacting. So at last we made our, selection; a Miss Wotton, who asked leave to bring her sister with her., She was a hard-faced brusque-mannered person, whose appearance in a, bachelor's household was not likely to cause a scandal. Her nose was in, itself a certificate of virtue. She was to bring her furniture into, the basement, and I was to give her and her sister one of the two upper, rooms for a bedroom.\\n\\nFrom that I turned to the most important point of all--the arrangement, of my consulting room. My experience with Cullingworth had taught me, one thing at least,--that patients care nothing about your house if they, only think that you can cure them. Once get that idea into their, heads, and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your, prescriptions on the manger. Still, as this was, for many a day to, come, to be the only furnished room in my house, it was worth a little, planning to get it set out to the best advantage.\\n\\n, I am writing this, my dear Bertie, at a little table which has been, fitted up in the window of my bedroom. Every one in the house is asleep, except myself; and all the noise of the city is hushed. Yet my own brain, is singularly active, and I feel that I am better employed in sitting, up and writing to you, than in tossing about upon my bed. I am often, accused of being sleepy in the daytime, but every now and then Nature, gets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night.\\n\\nI was supposed to have my eye upon him all day, with a two-hour interval, every afternoon and an evening to myself upon Fridays. But then what was, the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near, and I had, no friends whom I could visit? I did a fair amount of reading, for Lord, Saltire let me have the run of his library. Gibbon gave me a couple of, enchanting weeks. You know the effect that he produces. You seem to, be serenely floating upon a cloud, and looking down on all these pigmy, armies and navies, with a wise Mentor ever at your side to whisper to, you the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama.\\n\\nas we wonder to-day. I suppose that we DO know a little more than they., We have an arc of about three thousand years given us, from which to, calculate out the course to be described by our descendants; but that, arc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which Providence uses in, working out its designs that our deductions from it must, I think, be, uncertain. Will civilisation be swamped by barbarism? It happened once, before, because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of, darkness. But what, for example, could break down the great country in, which you dwell? No, our civilisation will endure and grow more complex., Man will live in the air and below the water. Preventive medicine will, develop until old age shall become the sole cause of death. Education, and a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime. The, English-speaking races will unite, with their centre in the United, States. Gradually the European States will follow their example. War, will become rare, but more terrible. The forms of religion will be, abandoned, but the essence will be maintained; so that one universal, creed will embrace the whole civilised earth, which will preach trust, in that central power, which will be as unknown then as now. That's my, horoscope, and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking. But, Bertie Swanborough and Stark Munro will be blowing about on the west, wind, and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half, of it has come to pass.\\n\\nI sat in my house all day, with that ever-present sense of privacy and, novelty which had thrilled me when I first shut the street door behind, me. At evening I sallied out and bought a loaf of bread, half a pound, of tea (\\\"sweepings,\\\" they call it, and it cost eightpence), a tin, kettle (fivepence), a pound of sugar, a tin of Swiss milk, and a tin, of American potted meat. I had often heard my mother groan over the, expenses of housekeeping, and now I began to understand what she meant., Two and ninepence went like a flash, but at least I had enough to keep, myself going for some days.\\n\\nwhich has been deepening from day to day. Well, it seemed to reach a, climax this morning, and on our way to the rooms I could hardly get a, word out of him. The place was fairly crowded with patients, but my, own share was rather below the average. When I had finished I added a, chapter to my novel, and waited until he and his wife were ready for the, daily bag-carrying homewards.\\n\\nThat evening, and for many evenings to come, we worked upon our liver., For our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat, in an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the, non-nitrogenous waxy matter. With our limited appliances the only way, we could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying, pan. So night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of, a beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in, making these grim fricassees. Nothing came of all our work; for though, Cullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case, and, wrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject, he was never, apt at stating his views with his pen, and he left, I am sure, a very, confused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was, driving at. Again, as he was a mere student without any letters after, his name, he got scant attention, and I never heard that he gained over, a single supporter.\\n\\nNow and again young Derwent introduced some excitement into my dull, life. On one occasion when we were walking in the grounds, he suddenly, snatched up a spade from a grass-plot, and rushed at an inoffensive, under-gardener. The man ran screaming for his life, with my patient, cursing at his very heels, and me within a few paces of him. When I at, last laid my hand on his collar, he threw down his weapon and burst into, shrieks of laughter. It was only mischief and not ferocity; but when, that under-gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like, a cream cheese. At night the attendant slept in a camp-bed at the foot, of the patient's, and my room was next door, so that I could be called, if necessary. No, it was not a very exhilarating life!\\n\\nand I hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and, theologians: \\\"our gross frames\\\" and \\\"our miserable mortal clay\\\" are, phrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety. It, is no compliment to the Creator to depreciate His handiwork. Whatever, theory or belief we may hold about the soul, there can, I suppose, be, no doubt that the body is immortal. Matter may be transformed (in which, case it may be re-transformed), but it can never be destroyed. If, a comet were to strike this globule of ours, and to knock it into a, billion fragments, which were splashed all over the solar system--if, its fiery breath were to lick up the earth's surface until it was peeled, like an orange, still at the end of a hundred millions of years, every tiniest particle of our bodies would exist--in other forms and, combinations, it is true, but still those very atoms which now form the, forefinger which traces these words. So the child with the same wooden, bricks will build a wall, then strew them on the table; then a tower\\n\\nIt wasn't a pretty sight. A woman, pinched and bedraggled, with a baby, on her arm, was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom I, judged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her. He was, one of those red-faced, dark-eyed men who can look peculiarly malignant, when they choose. It was clear that he was half mad with drink, and that, she had been trying to lure him away from some den. I was just in time, to see him take a flying kick at her, amid cries of \\\"Shame!\\\" from the, crowd, and then lurch forward again, with the evident intention of, having another, the mob still expostulating vaguely.\\n\\nThis pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes., I remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent, London specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row, who, amused himself by interjecting remarks. The lecturer appealed to his, audience at last. \\\"These interruptions are insufferable, gentlemen,\\\", said he; \\\"will no one free me from this annoyance?\\\" \\\"Hold your, tongue--you, sir, on the front bench,\\\" cried Cullingworth, in his, bull's bellow. \\\"Perhaps you'll make me,\\\" said the fellow, turning a, contemptuous face over his shoulder. Cullingworth closed his note-book\\n\\n, He was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity. You, cannot imagine a more savage-looking creature than Cullingworth is when, his temper goes wrong. He gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his, light blue eyes, and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra. He, isn't a beauty at his best, but at his worst he's really phenomenal. At, the first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room.\\n\\n\\\"You will permit me, Dr. Munro, sir, to place this trifle in your room., It's lava, sir; lava from Vesuvius, and made in Naples. By ----, you may, think its empty, Dr. Munro, sir, but it is full of my best wishes; and, when you've got the best practice in this town you may point to that, vase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport, who, backed you from the start.\\\"\\n\\nI had the kindest of leave takings from Horton. If he had been my, brother he could not have been more affectionate. I could not have, thought that I should grow so fond of a man in so short a time. He, takes the keenest interest in my venture, and I am to write him a full, account. He gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had, coloured himself--the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker., It was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at Bradfield, I, had a little harbour at Merton for which I could make. Still, of course\\n\\nmakes a most substantial meal. Butter I have discarded for the present., My actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day, but I am a, patron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day, which I, expend upon an evening paper; for with events hurrying on like this in, Alexandria, I cannot bear to be without the news. Still I often reproach, myself with that halfpenny, for if I went out in the evening and looked, at the placards I might save it, and yet have a general idea of what is, going on. Of course, a halfpenny a night sounds nothing, but think of a, shilling a month! Perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on, this diet! I am thin, it is true, but I never felt more fit in my life., So full of energy am I that I start off sometimes at ten at night and, walk hard until two or three in the morning. I dare not go out during, the day, you see, for fear that I should miss a patient. I have asked my, mother not to send little Paul down yet until I see my way more clearly.\\n\\nThen there are other cures which depend, I think, upon his own personal, magnetism. He is so robust and loud-voiced and hearty that a weak, nervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality. He is so, perfectly confident that he can cure them, that he makes them perfectly, confident that they can be cured; and you know how in nervous cases the, mind reacts upon the body. If he chose to preserve crutches and sticks\\n\\nThere was one other incident, however. One day after I had been in, practice about two months, I observed a bearded commonplace-looking, person lounging about on the other side of the road. In the afternoon he, was again visible from my consulting-room window. When I saw him there, once more next morning, my suspicions were aroused, and they became, certainties when, a day or so afterwards, I came out of a patient's, house in a poor street, and saw the same fellow looking into a, greengrocer's shop upon the other side. I walked to the end of the, street, waited round the corner, and met him as he came hurrying after.\\n\\nHowever, she took it most admirably. They were all three at breakfast, when I came round, the general, Mrs. La Force, and the daughter. Somehow, they seemed to know all that I had to say at the very sight of me; and, in their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me, for the, shock I had suffered, and the disturbance of my household. I found, myself turned from the consoler into the consoled. For an hour or more, we talked it over, I explaining what I hope needed no explanation, that, as the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to, know how immediate was his danger. There can be no doubt that the fall, of temperature and the quietness which both Porter and I had looked upon, as a hopeful sign, were really the beginning to the end.\\n\\nthere's order! And where there is order there must be mind, and where, there is mind there must be sense of Justice. I don't allow that there, can be any doubt as to the existence of that central Mind, or as to the, possession by it of certain attributes. The stars help me to realise, these. It is strange, when one looks upon them, to think that the, Churches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether, the Almighty is most gratified by our emptying a tea-spoonful of water, over our babies' heads, or by our waiting a few years and then plunging, them bodily into a tank. It would be comic if it were not so tragic.\\n\\nimmediately after my breach with Cullingworth. It's rather hard to know, where to begin when one has so many events to narrate, disconnected from, each other, and trivial in themselves, yet which have each loomed large, as I came upon them, though they look small enough now that they are so, far astern. As I have mentioned Cullingworth, I may as well say first, the little that is to be said about him. I answered his letter in the, way which I have, I think, already described. I hardly expected to hear, from him again; but my note had evidently stung him, and I had a, brusque message in which he said that if I wished him to believe in my, \\\"bona-fides\\\" (whatever he may have meant by that), I would return the, money which I had had during the time that I was with him at Bradfield., To this I replied that the sum was about twelve pounds; that I still, retained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds, if I came to Bradfield, that the balance in my favour was two hundred, and eighty-eight pounds; and that unless I had a cheque by return, I, should put the matter into the hands of my solicitor. This put a final, end to our correspondence.\\n\\nWhen the supper was finished, Cullingworth led the way into a small, sitting-room, where we both lit our pipes, and Mrs. Cullingworth her, cigarette. He sat for some little time in silence, and then bounding up, rushed to the door and flung it open. It is always one of his strange, peculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring, against him; for, in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness\\n\\npull up your socks!\\\" I should have been less surprised. And then, suddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind, and I rushed to, the cellar. The cask was tilted forward on the trestles. I struck it and, it boomed like a drum. I turned the tap, and not one drop appeared. Let, us draw a veil over the painful scene. Suffice it that Mrs. Wotton got, her marching orders then and there--and that next day Paul and I found, ourselves alone in the empty house once more.\\n\\nBut in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the, beginning of my stay with him, for my mother's letters stigmatising his, conduct had begun very early. For some time he had been uncertain how, to proceed. Then he had invented the excuse (which seemed to me at the, time, if you remember, to be quite inadequate) about the slight weekly, decline in the practice in order to get me out of it. His next move, was to persuade me to start for myself; and as this would be impossible, without money, he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small, weekly loan. I remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about, ordering furniture and other things, because tradesmen gave long credit, to beginners, and I could always fall back upon him if necessary. He, knew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at, least a year's tenancy. Then he waited to spring his mine until I had, written to say that I had finally committed myself, on which by return, of post came his letter breaking the connection. It was so long and so, elaborate a course of deceit, that I for the first time felt something, like fear as I thought of Cullingworth. It was as though in the, guise and dress of a man I had caught a sudden glimpse of something, sub-human--of something so outside my own range of thought that I was, powerless against it.\\n\\nIt was only when I went to my bedroom that I realised the oversights, which I had made in my furnishing. There was no mattress and no pillow, or bed-clothes. My mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the, practice, that I had never given a thought to my own private wants. I, slept that night upon the irons of my bed, and rose up like St. Lawrence, from the gridiron. My second suit of clothes with Bristowe's \\\"Principles, of Medicine\\\" made an excellent pillow, while on a warm June night a, man can do well wrapped in his overcoat. I had no fancy for second-hand, bed-clothes, and determined until I could buy some new ones, to make, myself a straw pillow, and to put on both my suits of clothes on the, colder nights. Two days later, however, the problem was solved in more, luxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother\\n\\nso that Lady Teazle or Mrs. Sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan, chair without soiling her dainty satin shoes. It brings home to me what, an unstable chemical compound man is. Here are the stage accessories, as good as ever, while the players have all split up into hydrogen, and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, with traces of iron and silica and, phosphorus. A tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water,--there, is the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair! It's a curious double, picture, if one could but conjure it up. On the one side, the high-born, bucks, the mincing ladies, the scheming courtiers, pushing and planning\\n\\n\\\"Of course, you see that the whole thing is to scale. My warship of the, future carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much, larger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet., Or I might have a separate raft, possibly, to carry my apparatus. My, ship goes into action. What happens then, Munro? Eh, what! Every shot, fired at her goes smack on to the magnet. There's a reservoir below into, which they drop when the electric circuit is broken. After every action, they are sold by auction for old metal, and the result divided as prize, money among the crew. But think of it, man! I tell you it is an absolute, impossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my, apparatus. And then look at the cheapness. You don't want armour. You, want nothing. Any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of, these. The war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound, ten. You're grinning again; but if you give me a magnet and a Brixton, trawler with a seven-pounder gun I'll show sport to the finest, battle-ship afloat.\\\"\\n\\nOf course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the, question. I could not feed one, far less pay one, and I had no kitchen, furniture. I must open my door to my own patients--let them think what, they would of it. I must clean my own plate and brush down my own front;, and these duties must be thoroughly done, come what might, for I must, show a presentable outside to the public. Well, there was no great, hardship in that, for I could do it under the cover of night. But I had, had a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely. She, had written to say that if I wished she would send my little brother, Paul to keep me company. I wrote back eagerly to agree. He was a hardy, cheery little fellow of nine, who would, I knew, gladly share hard times, with me; while, if they became unduly so, I could always have him taken, home again. Some weeks must pass before he could come, but it cheered me, to think of him. Apart from his company, there were a thousand ways in, which he might be useful.\\n\\nPoor chap, he had little enough to be cheery over either. He was an old, soldier who had lost a good many teeth, but who had continued to find, room between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe. Lately there, appeared a small sore on his nose which had spread, and become crusted., On feeling it I found it as hard as a streak of glue, with constant, darting pains passing through it. Of course, there could be no question, as to diagnosis. It was epitheliomatous cancer, caused by the irritation, of the hot tobacco smoke. I sent him back to his village, and two days, after I drove over in Cullingworth's dog-cart, and removed the growth. I, only got a sovereign for it. But it may be a nucleus for cases. The, old fellow did most admirably, and he has just been in (with a most, aristocratic curl to his nostrils) to tell me that he has bought a box, full of churchwardens. It was my first operation, and I daresay I was, more nervous about it than my patient, but the result has given me, confidence. I have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me. Come, what may, I am prepared to do it. Why should a man wait? Of course\\n\\nhowever, that at its best it is not worth more than L700 a year, with no, room for expansion. This is not large enough to keep two of us at work., Then, again, there are times when I can see that my religious opinions, annoy the dear old man. On the whole, and for every reason, I think, that it would be better if I were out of this. I applied for several, steamship lines, and for at least a dozen house surgeonships; but there, is as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as, if it were the Viceroyship of India. As a rule, I simply get my, testimonials returned without any comment, which is the sort of thing, that teaches a man humility. Of course, it is very pleasant to live with, the mater, and my little brother Paul is a regular trump. I am teaching, him boxing; and you should see him put his tiny fists up, and counter, with his right. He got me under the jaw this evening, and I had to ask, for poached eggs for supper.\\n\\nI wrote to you last on the night that I reached here. Next morning I set, to work upon my task. You would be surprised (at least I was) to see, how practical and methodical I can be. First of all I walked down to the, post-office and I bought a large shilling map of the town. Then back I, came and pinned this out upon the lodging-house table. This done, I set, to work to study it, and to arrange a series of walks by which I should, pass through every street of the place. You have no idea what that means, until you try to do it. I used to have breakfast, get out about ten\\n\\nIt was a newspaper cutting, which gave the true account of the incident., Suffice it that it was an ice accident, and that Cullingworth had really, behaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible, with, the child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered, his senses that they were able to separate them. I had hardly finished, reading it when we heard his step on the stairs; and she, thrusting, the paper back into her bosom, became in an instant the same silently, watchful woman as ever.\\n\\nwhich might no doubt involve some technical impossibility, but which, would at least be quite plausible and new. Then as he drew, his, bristling eyebrows would contract, his small eyes would gleam with, excitement, his lips would be pressed together, and he would end by, banging on the paper with his open hand, and shouting in his exultation., You would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes., But next instant, if you were to express surprise as to how it was that, the Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids, out, would come the pencil and envelope, and he would propound a scheme for, doing that with equal energy and conviction. This ingenuity was joined, to an extremely sanguine nature. As he paced up and down in his jerky, quick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention, he would, take out patents for it, receive you as his partner in the enterprise\\n\\n, I was so delighted, my dear chap, to have your assurance that nothing, that I have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend, you. It is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved I was at your, cordial letter. I have no one to whom I can talk upon such matters. I, am all driven inwards, and thought turns sour when one lets it, stagnate like that. It is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a, sympathetic listener--and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all, from another standpoint. It steadies and sobers one.\\n\\n\\\"By ----, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, \\\"I've asked every ---- man in, Birchespool that's got anything the matter with him. You'll have the, lot as patients within a week. There's Fraser, who's got a touch of, Martell's three star. He's coming. And there's Saunders, who talks about, nothing but his spleen. I'm sick of his ---- spleen! But I asked him., And there's Turpey's wound! This wet weather sets it tingling, and his, own surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline. He'll be there. And, there's Carr, who is drinking himself to death. He has not much for the, doctors, but what there is you may as well have.\\\"\\n\\nHis carriage was waiting, and we drove out to his residence, The, Myrtles, where I was speedily introduced both to his family and his, practice. The former is small, and the latter enormous. The wife is, dead; but her mother, Mrs. White, keeps house for him; and there are two, dear little girls, about five and seven. Then there is an unqualified, assistant, a young Irish student, who, with the three maids, the, coachman, and the stable boy, make up the whole establishment. When I, tell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do, you will, have an idea of the ground we cover.\\n\\nBut then our individuality? I often wonder whether something of that, wilt cling to our atoms--whether the dust of Johnnie Munro will ever, have something of him about it, and be separable from that of Bertie, Swanborough. I think it is possible that we DO impress ourselves upon, the units of our own structure. There are facts which tend to show that, every tiny organic cell of which a man is composed, contains in its, microcosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a, part. The ovum itself from which we are all produced is, as you know\\n\\n\\\"Let us see!\\\" says she, looking at the slate. \\\"He will be clear at seven, minutes past eight this evening. Yes, he could just manage it then. He, has no one at all from seven past to the quarter past\\\"--and so at the, appointed hour I have my patient precipitating himself into my room with, the demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a, railway station. If he knew that he is probably the only patient who has, opened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry--or think so, much of my advice.\\n\\n\\\"That's it,\\\" he shouted, stabbing at me with the amber. \\\"Naval supremacy, and command of the seas. It's all here right under your nose. I tell, you, Munro, I could go to Switzerland to-morrow, and I could say to, them--'Look here, you haven't got a seaboard and you haven't got a port;, but just find me a ship, and hoist your flag on it, and I'll give you, every ocean under heaven.' I'd sweep the seas until there wasn't a, match-box floating on them. Or I could make them over to a limited, company, and join the board after allotment. I hold the salt water in, the cup of this hand, every drop of it.\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed again in the most good-humoured way, and, as soon as, the young fellow had recovered, we all joined in quite a confidential, conversation. It is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities, of life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette. In half an hour we knew, all about each other, or at any rate I knew all about them. Mrs. La, Force was the mother's name, a widow with these two children. They had, given up housekeeping, and found it more pleasant to live in apartments\\n\\n\\\"I take a cursed interest in the whole thing. You may think it a ----, impertinence, but that's the way I'm made. As long as I can steam I'll, throw a rope to whoever wants a tow. I'll tell you what I'll do, Dr., Munro, sir. I'll stand on one tack if you'll stand on the other, and, I'll let you know if I come across anything that will do.\\\"\\n\\nThis train of thought is the after-swell from an argument with, Cullingworth this evening. He holds that the human race is deteriorating, mentally and morally. He calls out at the grossness which confounds the, Creator with a young Jewish Philosopher. I tried to show him that this, is no proof of degeneration, since the Jewish Philosopher at least, represented a moral idea, and was therefore on an infinitely higher, plane than the sensual divinities of the ancients. His own views of the, Creator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration. He declares, that looking round at Nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and, brutality. \\\"Either the Creator is not all-powerful, or else He is not, all-good,\\\" says he. \\\"Either He can stop these atrocities and won't, in, which case He is not all-good; or else He would stop them but can't, in, which case He is not all-powerful.\\\" It was a difficult dilemma for a man, who professes to stick to reason to get out of. Of course, if you plead, faith, you can always slip out of anything. I was forced to get behind, a corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own, thrusts. I said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted, that that which seemed evil really was EVIL. \\\"It lies with you to prove, that it isn't,\\\" said he. \\\"We may hope that it isn't,\\\" said I. \\\"Wait, until some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the, stomach,\\\" said he; and he shouted it out again every time I tried to, renew the argument.\\n\\nand I was going to leave Cullingworth at once. Then within a couple, of posts I had to write again and announce that my departure was, indefinitely postponed, and that I was actually doing his whole, practice. Well, the dear old lady was very angry. I don't suppose she, quite understood how temporary the necessity was, and how impossible it, would have been to leave Cullingworth in the lurch. She was silent for, nearly three weeks, and then she wrote a very stinging letter (and she, handles her adjectives most deftly when she likes). She went so far, as to say that Cullingworth was a \\\"bankrupt swindler,\\\" and that I had, dragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association, with him. This letter came on the morning of the very last day that my, patient was confined to the house. When I returned from work I found him, sitting in his dressing-gown downstairs. His wife, who had driven home\\n\\nIn the morning I went round to Mrs. La Force and gave her a bulletin., Her brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left., He had the Victoria Cross it seems, and was one of the desperate little, garrison who held Lucknow in that hell-whirl of a mutiny. And now the, sudden opening of a door sets him shaking, and a dropped tongs gives him, palpitations. Are we not the strangest kind of beings?\\n\\nWell, matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up, to the Dad saying that Mrs. Andrews' servant was ill, and would he come, at once. The old man had a touch of gout, so I donned my professional, coat and sallied forth, thinking that perhaps I might combine pleasure, with business, and have a few words with Laura. Sure enough, as I passed, up the gravel drive which curves round to the door, I glanced through, the drawing-room window, and saw her sitting painting, with her back, to the light. It was clear that she had not heard me. The hall door was, ajar, and when I pushed it open, no one was in the hall. A sudden fit, of roguishness came over me. I pushed the drawing-room door very slowly, wider, crept in on tiptoe, stole quietly across, and bending down, I, kissed the artist upon the nape of her neck. She turned round with a, squeal, and it was the mother!\\n\\nwhich was as extraordinary as everything else he did. I won't tell it, to you here, my dear Bertie, for I feel that I have dived down too many, side streets already; but it was a most bustling business, in which the, locking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of Cullingworth's, hair played prominent parts. Apropos of the latter he was never quite, able to get rid of its traces; and from this time forward there was, added to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight, struck upon his hair at certain angles, it turned it all iridescent and, shimmering.\\n\\nWe had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both, of us, without, however, any allusion to our past quarrel. He would, not admit that he had left Bradfield on account of a falling-off in his, practice, or for any reason except that he found the place too small., His spring-screen invention had, he said, been favourably reported upon, by one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the Clyde, and there, was every probability of their adopting it.\\n\\n\\\"Why the devil should we do all the good, Munro?\\\" he shouts. \\\"Eh, what? A, butcher would do good to the race, would he not, if he served his chops, out gratis through the window? He'd be a real benefactor; but he goes, on selling them at a shilling the pound for all that. Take the case of, a doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science. He flushes out drains\\n\\nAnd then the more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance, not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound, interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been, accumulated since the dawning of time. Some eighty thousand years are, supposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man. Yet, in all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of, chipping them. But within our father's lives what changes have there not, been? The railway and the telegraph, chloroform and applied electricity., Ten years now go further than a thousand then, not so much on account, of our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to, more. Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain, footsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal.\\n\\nWe filed off once more, he leading with the huge brass \\\"Dr. Munro\\\", under his arm; then the little woman, and then this rather perturbed, and bemuddled young man. He and his wife sat on the deal table in the, consulting room, like a hawk and a turtle-dove on the same perch, while, I leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets. Nothing, could be more prosaic and informal; but I knew very well that I was at a, crisis of my life. Before, it was only a choosing between two roads. Now, my main track had run suddenly to nothing, and I must go back or find a, bye-path.\\n\\nAm I not the slowest of story-tellers? But you encourage me to it by, your sympathetic interest in details. However, I shall move along a, little faster now. Next morning I was off to Lochtully, which, as you, know, is in the north of Perthshire. It stands three miles from the, station, a great gray pinnacled house, with two towers cocking out above, the fir woods, like a hare's ears from a tussock of grass. As we drove, up to the door I felt pretty solemn--not at all as the main line should, do when it condescends to visit the cadet branch. Into the hall as I, entered came a grave learned-looking man, with whom in my nervousness, I was about to shake hands cordially. Fortunately he forestalled the, impending embrace by explaining that he was the butler. He showed, me into a small study, where everything stank of varnish and morocco, leather, there to await the great man. He proved when he came to be a, much less formidable figure than his retainer--indeed, I felt thoroughly, at my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth. He is grizzled\\n\\nSo those were the last words of Cullingworth, and the last that I may, ever see of him also, for he starts almost immediately upon his strange, venture. He must succeed. He is a man whom nothing could hold down. I, wish him luck, and have a kindly feeling towards him, and yet I distrust, him from the bottom of my heart, and shall be just as pleased to know, that the Atlantic rolls between us.\\n\\nThey moved in a few days later. I was out at the time, and the first, intimation I had was finding three little dogs in my hall when I, returned. I had her up, and explained that this was a breach of, contract, and that I had no thoughts of running a menagerie. She pleaded, very hard for her little dogs, which it seems are a mother and two, daughters of some rare breed; so I at last gave in on the point., The other sister appeared to lead a subterranean troglodytic sort of, existence; for, though I caught a glimpse of her whisking round the, corner at times, it was a good month before I could have sworn to her in, a police court.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}],"source":["dataset.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"id":"_-SNsspNmNy-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714499408526,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset['processed_text'] = dataset['processed_text'].apply(lambda x: \" \".join(x))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"uVZSMNOer3-q","outputId":"508e9f1b-d353-4dfe-f151-37306abe3569","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714499410666,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2144,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   author_id                                               text  \\\n","1        132  \"It was a good kowl,\" said the leader. \"First ...   \n","2        132  till the Hall rang and the hounds bayed.

She was dressed as for a journey, and about the corners, of her mouth were lines familiar to Christopher, the sight of which sent, his heart into his boots. Fortunately, he recovered himself in time to, greet her with a smile. It was not the smile he had been rehearsing half, the day, but that it was a smile of any sort astonished the words away, from Mrs. Korner's lips, and gave him the inestimable advantage of first, speech.\\n\\n\\\"I was unable to oblige you before,\\\" explained Mr. Korner, \\\"having to, keep my head clear for business, and not knowing what the effect upon, one might be. Yesterday I did my best, and I hope you are pleased with, me. Though, if you could see your way to being content--just for the, present and until I get more used to it--with a similar performance not, oftener than once a fortnight, say, I should be grateful,\\\" added Mr., Korner.\\n\\n\\\"We had one bottle of claret between us,\\\" Mr. Korner would often recall, to his mind, \\\"of which he drank the greater part. And then he brought, out the little green flask. He said it was made from pears--that in Peru, they kept it specially for Children's parties. Of course, that may have, been his joke; but in any case I cannot see how just one glass--I wonder, could I have taken more than one glass while he was talking.\\\" It was a, point that worried Mr. Korner.\\n\\nThe \\\"he\\\" who had talked, possibly, to such bad effect was a distant, cousin of Mr. Korner's, one Bill Damon, chief mate of the steamship, _La Fortuna_. Until their chance meeting that afternoon in Leadenhall, Street, they had not seen each other since they were boys together. The, _Fortuna_ was leaving St. Katherine's Docks early the next morning bound, for South America, and it might be years before they met again. As Mr., Damon pointed out, Fate, by thus throwing them into each other's arms\\n\\n\\\"Sorry I am late,\\\" said Mr. Korner, bursting cheerfully into the room., It was a point with Mr. Korner always to be cheerful in the morning., \\\"Greet the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing,\\\" was, the motto Mrs. Korner, this day a married woman of six months and three, weeks standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on, precisely two hundred and two occasions. The Motto entered largely into, the scheme of Mr. Korner's life. Written in fine copperplate upon cards, all of the same size, a choice selection counselled him each morning, from the rim of his shaving-glass.\\n\\n\\\"You sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached, eggs, while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table. At, the end of it, seeing you had gone to sleep yourself, I persuaded her, to go to bed. It was three o'clock, and we thought you would not mind.\\\", Miss Greene drew up a chair, and, with her elbows on the table, looked, across at Mr. Korner. Decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of Mrs., Korner's bosom friend.\\n\\nMr. Korner sat up suddenly and looked about him. This was not bed., The fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the, tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A, tingling sensation about his head called for investigation. Mr. Korner, was forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a, salad of him--somebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard. A, sound directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.\\n\\nThe sight of Acacia Villa, suggesting that everybody was in bed and, asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife would have been, sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting, on the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As, the door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring., The window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.\\n\\nit suddenly occurred to Mr. Korner that he was an unappreciated man., Mrs. Korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which, the beauties of the Southern Main endeavoured feebly to express their, consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no way--as far as he could, see--to Mr. Korner himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner, did say and did do, tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes. Noticing that, a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and, hurried on. Pacing the platform of the Mansion House Station, where, it is always draughty, the thought of his wrongs returned to him with, renewed force. Why was there no trace of doglike devotion about Mrs., Korner? The fault--so he bitterly told himself--the fault was his., \\\"A woman loves her master; it is her instinct,\\\" mused Mr. Korner to, himself. \\\"Damme,\\\" thought Mr. Korner, \\\"I don't believe that half her, time she knows I am her master.\\\"\\n\\nThe two friends talked of many things. And later on they spoke of, sweethearts and of wives. Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been, wide and varied. They talked--or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr., Korner listened--of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of, the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian, valleys. The mate had theories concerning the care and management of, women: theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood, the test of studied application. A new world opened out to Mr. Korner;, a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who\",\n          \"and such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you., You said what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered, to no one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost, like a gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the, devil himself. Why should you? While your cousin Philip, with his, parrot talk and sneaking ways, turned my stomach. I was sick of him\\n\\nScarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon Mrs., Manners. Her first care, and Dorothy's, was to catechise me most, particularly on my state. And whilst they were so occupied Mr. Marmaduke, entered, wholly frenzied from fright, and utterly oblivious to his own, blame in the matter. He was sent out again directly. After that, with, Aunt Lucy to assist, they hurriedly packed what few things might be, taken. The costly relics of Arlington Street were untouched, and the, French clock was left on the mantel to tick all the night, and for days, to come, in a silent and forsaken room; or perhaps to greet impassively, the King's officers when they broke in at the door. But I caught my lady, in the act of wrapping up the Wedgwood cups and dishes.\\n\\nalways chosen by my lady herself. There I sat by the hour, swathed in, many layers of wool, and tended by her hands alone. Every nook and, cranny of our lives were revealed to the other. She loved to hear of, Patty and my years at Gordon's, and would listen with bated breath to the, stories of the Ranger and the Bonhomme Richard, and of that strange man, whom we both loved, whose genius had made those cruises famous., Sometimes, in low voices, we talked of our future; but often, when the, wind blew and the deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters, a, silence would fall between us that needed no word to interpret.\\n\\nlaunching forth at once, nothing daunted by such cold conservatism., \\\"What Israelite brickmaker of Pharaoh's dreamed of Solomon's temple?, Nay, Moses himself had no conception of it. And God will send us our, pillars of cloud and of fire. We must be reconciled to our great, destiny, Mr. Carroll. No fight ever was won by man or nation content, with half a victory. We have forests to build an hundred armadas, and I, will command a fleet and it is given me.\\\"\\n\\nNot a sound came from Dorothy, nor did I dare to look at her face. The, whole matter was clear to me now. After his conversation with me, Mr., Marmaduke had lost no time in seeing Mr. Dix, in order to raise money on, my prospects. And the man of business had gone straight to Grafton with, the intelligence. The suspicion flashed through me that Mr. Allen had, been sent to spy, but his very next words disarmed it.\\n\\nThen a cry came floating down from aloft. Thrice did I hear it, like one, waking out of a sleep, ere I grasped its import. \\\"The Alliance! The, Alliance!\\\" But hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the, ship, when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft, forward. \\\"She rakes us! She rakes us!\\\" And the French soldiers tumbled, headlong down from the poop with a wail of \\\"Les Anglais font prise!\\\", \\\"Her Englishmen have taken her, and turned her guns against us!\\\" Our, captain was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and, stripes waved black in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what, happened next. The gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down, his face, shouting that the Richard was sinking, and yelling for quarter, as he made for the ensign-staff on the poop, for the flag was shot away., Him the commodore felled with a pistol-butt. At the gunner's heels were, the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken, released by the master at, arms. They swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of, Tartars, unkempt and wild and desperate with fear, until I thought that, the added weight on the scarce-supported deck would land us all in the, bilges. Words fail me when I come to describe the frightful panic of, these creatures, frenzied by the instinct of self-preservation. They, surged hither and thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a, storm-swept coast. They trampled rough-shod over the moaning heaps of, wounded and dying, and crowded the crews at the guns, who were powerless, before their numbers. Some fought like maniacs, and others flung, themselves into the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, \\\"you have not dined, and neither have I. We shall be, merry to-day, and you shall have some of the best Madeira in the, colonies.\\\" I commanded a room, that we might have privacy. As he took, his seat opposite me I marked that he had grown heavier and more browned., But his eye had the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore. And, first I upbraided him for not having writ me.\\n\\nThe door creaked, and in my eagerness I tried to lift myself. 'Twas Aunt, Lucy's hand that restrained me, and the next face I saw was that of, Dorothy's mother. But why did it appear so old and sorrow-lined? And, why was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap? She took, my fingers in her own, and asked me anxiously if I felt any pain.\\n\\n\\\"Despite the host of troubles he had on his hands, your commodore himself, came with us to Rotterdam. Now I protest I love that man, who has more, humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in England who call him, hard names. If you could have seen him leaning over you, and speaking to, you, and feeling every minute for your heart-beats, egad, you would have, cried. And when I took you off to the schooner, he gave me an hundred, directions how to care for you, and then his sorrow bowled him all in a, heap.\\\"\\n\\nWhen I came on deck the next morning our yards were a-drip with a clammy, fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze. We were, standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused, in the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, and that we, were near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all, that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though, we had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my, eyes through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our, starboard beam.\\n\\nMrs. Manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to Carvel Hall. It was, on a sparkling morning in February that we sighted the familiar toe of, Kent Island, and the good-natured skipper put about and made for the, mouth of our river. Then, as of old, the white cupola of Carvel House, gleamed a signal of greeting, to which our full hearts beat a silent, response. Once again the great windmill waved its welcome, and the same, memory was upon us both as we gazed. Of a hale old gentleman in the, sheets of a sailing pinnace, of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering, with excitement of the days to come. Dorothy gently pressed my hand as, the bark came into the wind, and the boat was dropped into the green, water. Slowly they lowered me into it, for I was still helpless, Dorothy, and her mother and Aunt Lucy were got down, and finally Mr. Marmaduke, stepped gingerly from the sea-ladder over the gunwale. The cutter leaped, under the strong strokes up the river with the tide. Then, as we rounded, the bend, we were suddenly astonished to see people gathered on the, landing at the foot of the lawn, where they had run, no doubt, in a, flurry at sight of the ship below. In the front of the group stood, out a strangely familiar figure.\\n\\nFifty and five minutes had been registered by the French clock, when the, rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below, and Charles Fox, panted up the stairs, muffled in a huge wrap-rascal. 'Twas he and Aunt, Lucy carried me down to the street, Dorothy walking at my side, and, propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting., This was an ample travelling-carriage with a lamp hanging from its top\\n\\nSuddenly, glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were, aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big, Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great, ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the, mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes, sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the, commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our, guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.\\n\\nBefore we could answer he was gone into the night; and my Lord, standing, without, had closed the carriage door. And that was the last I saw of, this noble man, the true friend of America, who devoted his glorious, talents and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the, greatness of England. He who was followed by the prayers of the English, race was ever remembered in our own humble ones.\\n\\nwaited on by the old servants of my grandfather. At our whim my chair, would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts; on cool days, we sat in the sun by the dial, where the flowers mingled their odours, with the salt breezes off the Chesapeake; or anon, when it was warmer, in, the summer-house my mother loved, or under the shade of the great trees, on the lawn, looking out over the river. And once my lady went off very, mysteriously, her eyes brimful of mischief, to come back with the first, strawberries of the year staining her apron.\\n\\nLord Comyn and Mr. Fox. They may do something for you, now you own your, estate. My dear sir, I dislike to say aught against any man. Mrs., Manners will tell you of their kindness to us, but I vow I have not been, able to see it. With all the money at their command they will not loan, me a penny in my pressing need. And I shame to say it, my own daughter, prevents me from obtaining the money to keep us out of the Fleet. I know, she has spoken to Dulany. Think of it, Richard, my own daughter, upon, whom I lavished all when I had it, who might have made a score of grand, matches when I gave her the opportunity, and now we had all been rolling, in wealth. I'll be sworn I don't comprehend her, nor her mother either\\n\\n\\\"I have seen many men since, but never have I met your equal for a most, damnable frankness, Richard Carvel. Even Jack, here, is not half so, blunt and uncompromising. But you took my fancy--God knows why!--that, first night I clapped eyes on you in Arlington Street, and I loved you, when your simplicity made us that speech at Brooks's Club. So you have, not forgotten that morning under the trees, when the dew was on the, grass. Faith, I am glad of it. What children we were!\\\" he said, and, sighed.\\n\\nthough not very handsomely. Fears for my own safety alone kept me from, telling you and Mr. Swain. And I swear to you that I was sorry for the, venture almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling., The scheme was laid out before I took you for a pupil; indeed, that was, part of it, as you no doubt have guessed. As God hears me, I learned to, love you, Richard, in those days at the rectory. You were all of a man\\n\\n\\\"Ay, he's back,\\\" he returned, with a grunt that was half a growl; \\\"arter, three weeks breakin' o' liberty. I tell 'ee what, sir, them Frenchies is, treecherous devils, an' not to be trusted the len'th of a lead line. An', they beant seamen eno' to keep a full an' by with all their 'takteek'., Ez fer that Landais, I hearn him whinin' at the commodore in the round, house when we was off Clear, an' sayin' as how he would tell Sartin on us, when he gets back to Paree. An' jabberin to th'other Frenchmen as was, there that this here butter-cask was er King's ship, an' that the, commodore weren't no commodore nohow. They say as how Cap'n Jones be, bound up in a hard knot by some articles of agreement, an' daresn't, punish him. Be that so, Mr. Carvel?\\\"\\n\\nAs few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of Charles, James Fox and of John Paul Jones. The latter hero actually made a voyage, in the brigantine 'John' about the time he picked up Richard Carvel from, the Black Moll, after the episode with Mungo Maxwell at Tobago. The, Scotch scene, of course, is purely imaginary. Accuracy has been aimed at, in the account of the fight between the 'Bonhomme Richard' and the, 'Serapis', while a little different arrangement might have been better, for the medium of the narrative. To be sure, it was Mr. Mease, the, purser, instead of Richard Carvel, who so bravely fought the quarter-deck, guns; and in reality Midshipman Mayrant, Commodore Jones's aide, was, wounded by a pike in the thigh after the surrender. No injustice is done, to the second and third lieutenants, who were absent from the ship during, the action.\\n\\n\\\"You will cherish her, Richard,\\\" he said brokenly, \\\"for her like is not, to be found in this world. I knew her worth when first she came to, London, as arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance. I saw then that a, great love alone was needed to make her the highest among women, and from, the night I fought with you at the Coffee House I have felt upon whom, that love would fall. O thou of little faith,\\\" he cried, \\\"what little I, may have done has been for her. No, Richard, you do not deserve her, but, I would rather think of her as your wife than that of any man living.\\\"\\n\\nI cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after Mr. Swain's death., One hope had lightened all the years of my servitude. For, when I, examined my soul, I knew that it was for Dorothy I had laboured. And, every letter that came from Comyn telling me she was still free gave me, new heart for my work. By some mystic communion--I know not what--I felt, that she loved me yet, and despite distance and degree. I would wake of, a morning with the knowledge of it, and be silent for half the day with, some particle of a dream in my head, lingering like the burden of a song, with its train of memories.\\n\\nIn the meantime the American frigate 'Alliance' had brought Lafayette to, France, and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the, 'Bon homme Richard'. One of the most fatal mistakes Congress ever made, was to put Captain Pierre Landais in command of her, out of compliment to, the French allies. He was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to, get him a command in his own navy. His insulting conduct and treachery, to Captain Jones are strongly attested to in Mr. Carvel's manuscript:, they were amply proved by the written statements of other officers.\\n\\n\\\"A hawser, Mr. Stacey, a hawser!\\\" I heard the commodore shout, and saw, the sailing-master slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and, wounded and mass of broken spars and tackles, and finally pick up a, smeared rope's end, which I helped him drag to the poop. There we found, the commodore himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the, severed stays and shrouds dangling from the bowsprit, the French marines, looking on.\\n\\n\\\"No one knows of it, Richard, or is likely to. Dr. Barry, like so many, in England, is a good Whig and friend to America. And you are in a part, of London far removed from Mayfair.\\\" She hesitated, and then continued, in a voice that strove to be lighter: \\\"This little house is in Charlotte, Street, Mary-le-Bone, for the war has made all of us suffer some. And we, are more fortunate than many, for we are very comfortable here, and, though I say it, happier than in Arlington Street. And the best of our, friends are still faithful. Mr. Fox, with all his greatness, has never, deserted us, nor my Lord Comyn. Indeed, we owe them much more than I can, tell you of now,\\\" she said, and sighed. \\\"They are here every day of the, world to inquire for you, and it was his Lordship brought you out of, Holland.\\\"\\n\\nA master might picture my happiness, waking and sleeping, through the, short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light. The, memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe, a little more rounded, than of yore, and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the, world's mysteries. Dorothy had looked the lady in rags, and housewife's, cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades. When for any, reason she was absent from my side, I moped, to the quiet amusement of, Mrs. Manners and the more boisterous delight of Aunt Lucy, who took her, turn sewing in the window. I was near to forgetting the use of words\\n\\nNo one may read the annals of these men, who were at once brave and, courtly, and of these women, who were ladies by nature as well as by, birth, and not love them. The fascination of that free and hospitable, life has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it, with a genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to, the pleasure he has derived from the history of Maryland.\\n\\nThe squadron sailed from L'Orient in June, but owing to a collision, between the Bon homme Richard and the Alliance it was forced to put back, into the Groix roads for repairs. Nails and rivets were with difficulty, got to hold in the sides of the old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul, Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels:, Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve;, and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed, upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have, absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf, parted company, never to return. After the most outrageous conduct off, the coast of Ireland, Landais, in the 'Alliance', left the squadron on, September 6th, and did not reappear until the 23d, the day of the battle.\\n\\nBefore Christmas we went to the Eastern Shore. In Annapolis fife and, drum had taken the place of fiddle and clarion; militia companies were, drilling in the empty streets; despatches were arriving daily from the, North; and grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings. But if the war was, to come, I must settle what was to be done at Gordon's Pride with all, possible speed. It was only a few days after our going there, that I, rode into Oxford with a black cockade in my hat Patty had made me, and, the army sword Captain Jack had given Captain Daniel at my side. For I, had been elected a lieutenant in the Oxford company, of which Percy, Singleton was captain.\\n\\nI smiled, but more in sadness than amusement. Hardship had only degraded, Mr. Marmaduke the more, and even in trouble his memory was convenient as, is that of most people in prosperity. I was of no mind to jog his, recollection. But I wanted badly to ask about his Grace. Where had my, fine nobleman been at the critical point of his friend's misfortunes?, For I had had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk, with McAndrews.\\n\\n\\\"I came here to-night to betray you, and might have gone hence to your, uncle to claim my pieces of silver. I remain to tell you that Grafton, has an appointment at nine with his Majesty's chief Secretary of State., I need not mention his motives, nor dwell upon your peril. For the, King's sentiments toward Paul Jones are well known. You must leave, London without delay, and so must Mr. Manners and his family.\\\"\\n\\npresently to be pieced together. The injuries Mr. Marmaduke had done me, were the first to collect, since I was searching for the cause of my, resentment against him. The incidents arrived haphazard as magic, lanthorn views, but very vivid. His denial of me before Mr. Dix, and his, treachery at Vauxhall, when he had sent me to be murdered. Next I felt, myself clutching the skin over his ribs in Arlington Street, when I had, flung him across the room in his yellow night-gown. That brought me to, the most painful scene of my life, when I had parted with Dorothy at the, top of the stairs. Afterward followed scraps of the years at Gordon's, Pride, and on top of them the talk with McAndrews. Here was the secret, I sought. The crash had come. And they were no longer in Mayfair, but, must have taken a house in some poorer part of London. This thought cast, me down tremendously.\\n\\n\\\"Orchardson died before I had made one voyage,\\\" he replied, \\\"and the, Betsy changed owners. But I did not forget you, Richard, and was, resolved but now not to leave Maryland until I had seen you. But I burn, to hear of you,\\\" he added. \\\"I have had an inkling of your story from the, landlord. So your grandfather is dead, and that blastie, your uncle, of, whom you told me on the John, is in possession.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and, stripes over a man-o'-war. They got away on November 14, 1777, with a, fair crew and a poor lot of officers. Mr. Carvel had many a brush with, the mutinous first lieutenant Simpson. Family influence deterred the, captain from placing this man under arrest, and even Dr. Franklin found, trouble, some years after, in bringing about his dismissal from the, service. To add to the troubles, the Ranger proved crank and, slow-sailing; and she had only one barrel of rum aboard, which made, the men discontented.\\n\\nThose of us who had clung to hope lost it then. Standing with my back, to the mast, beating them off with a pike, visions of an English, prison-ship, of an English gallows, came before me. I counted the, seconds until the enemy's seamen would be pouring through our ragged, ports. The seventh and last time, and we were beaten, for we had not men, enough left on our two decks to force them down again. Yes,--I shame to, confess it--the heart went clean out of me, and with that the pain, pulsed and leaped in my head like a devil unbound. At a turn of the hand, I should have sunk to the boards, had not a voice risen strong and clear, above that turmoil, compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps.\\n\\n\\\"And now I shall tell you something of the story of the Duke of, Chartersea,\\\" she went on, and I felt her tremble as she spoke that name., \\\"I think of all we have Lord Comyn to thank for, next to saving your life, twice, was his telling you of the danger I ran. And, Richard, after, refusing you that day on the balcony over the Park, I had no hope left., You may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in London, after that. Richard,\\\" she said, \\\"do you recall my asking you in the, coach, on the way from Castle Yard, for the exact day you met my father, in Arlington Street?\\\"\\n\\nand then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet. For the old, archness, at least, would never be eradicated. Presently, after she had, taken the cup and smoothed my pillow, I reached out for her hand. It was, a boldness of which I had not believed myself capable; but she did not, resist, and even, as I thought, pressed my fingers with her own slender, ones, the red of our Maryland holly blushing in her cheeks. And what, need of words, indeed! Our thoughts, too, flew coursing hand in hand, through primrose paths, and the angels themselves were not to be envied.\\n\\n\\\"And I possessed the love of such a woman, Richard,\\\" he said, in another, tone, \\\"I think I should die of happiness. She will never tell you how, these weeks past she has scarce left your side. The threats combined, of her mother and the doctor, and Charles and me, would not induce her, to take any sleep. And time and time have I walked from here to Brook, Street without recognizing a step of the way, lifted clear out of myself, by the sight of her devotion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are always finding friends, Richard,\\\" said he; \\\"no matter what your, misfortunes, they are ever double discounted. As for me; I am like, Fulmer in Mr. Cumberland's 'West Indian': 'I have beat through every, quarter of the compass; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to, serve my country; I have'--I am engaging to betray it. No, Scotland is, no longer my country, and so I cannot betray her. It is she who has, betrayed me.\\\"\\n\\nMy own duties took me to the dark lower deck, a vile place indeed, and, reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals. There I had charge of, the battery of old eighteens, while Mr. Dale commanded the twelves on the, middle deck. We loaded our guns with two shots apiece, though I had my, doubts about their standing such a charge, and then the men stripped, until they stood naked to the waist, waiting for the fight to begin. For, we could see nothing of what was going forward. I was pacing up and, down, for it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the, gun-ports closed, when about three bells of the dog, Mr. Mease, the, purser, appeared on the ladder.\\n\\nThat the rough and bluff captains of the American service should have, regarded a man of Paul Jones's type with suspicion is not surprising., They resented his polish and accomplishments, and could not understand, his language. Perhaps it was for this reason, as well as a reward for, his brilliant services, that he was always given a separate command. In, the summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power, of the United States, nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate, 'Indien', then building at Amsterdam. And he was ordered to France in, command of the 'Ranger', a new ship then fitting at Portsmouth. Captain, Jones was the admiration of all the young officers in the navy, and was, immediately flooded with requests to sail with him. One of his first, acts, after receiving his command, was to apply to the Marine Committee, for Mr. Carvel. The favour was granted.\\n\\n\\\"We are not yet an infant state, sir,\\\" Mr. Carroll put in, with a shade, of rebuke. For Maryland was well content with the government she had, enjoyed, and her best patriots long after shunned the length of, secession. \\\"I believe and pray that the King will come to his senses., And as for the navy, it is folly. How can we hope to compete with, England on the sea?\\\"\\n\\nrolling his quid to show his pleasure of the topic, \\\"they sits on their, bottoms in Brest and L'Oriong an' talks takteek wi' their han's and, mouths, and daresn't as much as show the noses o' their three-deckers in, th' Bay o' Biscay, while Cap'n Jones pokes his bowsprit into every port, in England with a hulk the rats have left. I've had my bellyful o', Frenchies, Mr. Carvell save it be to fight 'em. An' I tell 'ee 'twould, give me the greatest joy in life t' leave loose 'Scolding Sairy' at that, there Landais. Th' gal ain't had a match on her this here cruise, an' t', my mind she couldn't be christened better, sir.\\\"\\n\\nThe boatswains' whistles trilled through the ship, pikes were seized, and, pistol and cutlass buckled on. But even as we waited with set teeth, our, bows ground into the enemy's weather quarter-gallery. For the Richard's, rigging was much cut away, and she was crank at best. So we backed and, filled once more, passing the Englishman close aboard, himself being, aback at the time. Several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in, front of me, shattering a nine-pounder and killing half of its crew. And, it is only a miracle that I stand alive to be able to tell the tale., Then I caught a glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our, wheel, and over went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the, 'Serapis', where we might rake and rush her decks. Our old Indiaman, answered but doggedly; and the huge bowsprit of the Serapis, towering, over our heads, snapped off our spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen, rigging.\\n\\nAs a result of that trip he got the Duras, which he renamed the 'Bon, homme Richard' in honour of Dr. Franklin. The Duras was an ancient, Indiaman with a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw, her, at the remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy. She was, perfectly rotten, and in the constructor's opinion not worth refitting., Her lowest deck (too low for the purpose) was pierced aft with three, ports on a side, and six worn-out eighteen-pounders mounted there. Some, of them burst in the action, killing their people. The main battery, on, the deck above, was composed of twenty-eight twelve-pounders. On the, uncovered deck eight nine-pounders were mounted. Captain Jones again, showed his desire to serve the cause by taking such a ship, and not, waiting for something better.\\n\\nmy old tutor, and rector of St. Anne's. And 'twas a baffling, intangible, change. 'Twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face, for he was now, just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul. The, coarse wine and coarse food of the lower coffee-houses of London had, replaced the rich and abundant fare of Maryland. The next day was become, one of the terrors of his life. His clothes were of poor stuff, but, aimed at the fashion. And yet--and yet, as I looked upon him, a, something was in his face to puzzle me entirely. I had seen many stamps, of men, but this thing I could not recognize.\\n\\n\\\"You will not believe him, Richard,\\\" cried my Lord; \\\"you have only to, look at him to see that he lies. Take note of the ragged uniform of the, rebel army he carries, and then think of him 'en petite maitre', with his, cabriolet and his chestnuts. Egad, he might be as rich as Rigby were it, not for those principles which he chooses to deride. And I have seen him, reduced to a crown for them. I tell you, Richard,\\\" said my Lord, \\\"by, espousing your cause Charles is become greater than the King. For he, has the hearts of the English people, which George has not, and the, allegiance of you Americans, which George will never have. And if you, once heard him, in Parliament, you should hear him now, and see the, Speaker wagging his wig like a man bewitched, and hear friends and, enemies calling out for him to go on whenever he gives the sign of a, pause.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ill uncos, sir,\\\" he answered, shaking his head with violence. He had, indeed but a sorry tale for my ear, and one to make my heart heavier than, it was. McAndrews opened his mind to me, and seemed the better for it., How Mr. Marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was, more than the honest Scotchman could imagine. There was a country place, in Sussex now, said he, that was the latest. And drafts were coming in, before the wheat was in the ear; and the plantations of tobacco on the, Western Shore had been idle since the non-exportation, and were mortgaged, to their limit to Mr. Willard. Money was even loaned on the Wilmot House, estate. McAndrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither Mrs. Manners nor, Miss Dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs.\\n\\n\\\"Now, and never again, dear,\\\" she said. \\\"Yes, I saw and heard all that, passed in the drawing-room. And I did not blame, but praised you for it., I have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since. God, forgive me!\\\" she cried, \\\"but I have despised him from that hour. When, I knew that he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute, working, upon me to save his honour, of which he has not the smallest spark; that, he had recognized and denied you, friendless before our house, and sent, you into the darkness at Vauxhall to be murdered, then he was no father, of mine. I would that you might know what my mother has suffered from, such a man, Richard.\\\"\\n\\nIf the divine power of genius ever made itself felt, 'twas on that May, evening, at candle-light, in the Annapolis Coffee House. With my own, eyes I witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province, thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight, and twenty. As for good Captain Daniel, enthusiasm is but a poor word to, express his feelings. A map was sent for and spread out upon the table., And it was a late hour when Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll went home\\n\\nThe author makes most humble apologies to any who have, or think they, have, an ancestor in this book. He has drawn the foregoing with a very, free hand, and in the Maryland scenes has made use of names rather than, of actual personages. His purpose, however poorly accomplished, was to, give some semblance of reality to this part of the story. Hence he has, introduced those names in the setting, choosing them entirely at random, from the many prominent families of the colony.\\n\\nThey were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking, hatches, and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a, desperate vigour. Then, all at once, the towering mainmast of the enemy, cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds., The first intense silence of the battle followed, in the midst of which, came a cry from our top:\\n\\nNor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the Atlantic., We reached Lisbon in safety, and after a week of lodgings in that city by, the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for Baltimore. For, the Chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war, and kept alive the, credit of the young nation. There were many excitements ere we sighted, the sand-spits of Virginia, and off the Azores we were chased for a day, and a night by a British sloop of war. Our captain, however, was a cool, man and a seaman, and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the, Capes very triumphantly.\\n\\n\\\"What plan, sir!\\\" said Captain John Paul, those wonderful eyes of his, alight. \\\"In the first place, we Americans build the fastest ships in the, world,--yours of the Chesapeake are as fleet as any. Here, if I am not, mistaken, one hundred and eighty-two were built in the year '71. They, are idle now. To them I would issue letters of marque, to harry, England's trade. From Carolina to Maine we have the wood and iron to, build cruisers, in harbours that may not easily be got at. And skilled, masters and seamen to elude the enemy.\\\"\\n\\nMy heart bled for him. Some minutes passed that he did not speak, making, shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by, a strong emotion. \\\"'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was, greatest. Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles, in his coat, and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on, since Dolly and he and I had stood together on the Betsy's deck.\\n\\nWhen next consciousness came, the tarry, salt smell of a ship was in my, nostrils, and I knew that we were embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a, fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and, the tramp of feet on the deck above my head. Framed against the, irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water, beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.\\n\\nand the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead. At last, when I, was getting fairly restless, the distant tones of a voice, deep and, reverberating, smote upon my ear, jarring painfully some long-forgotten, chord. That voice belonged to but one man alive, and yet I could not, name him. Even as I strained, the tones drew nearer, and they were mixed, with sweeter ones I knew well, and Dorothy's mother's voice. Whilst I, was still searching, the door opened, the voices fell calm, and Dorothy, came in bearing a candle in each hand. As she set them down on the, table, I saw an agitation in her face, which she strove to hide as she, addressed me.\\n\\nThe scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning. A knot of, midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing Landais's conduct, and, cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up, short. Mr. Stacey, the sailing-master, had the deck, and the coasting, pilot was conning; now and anon the boatswain's whistle piped for Garrett, or Quito or Fogg to lay aft to the mast, where the first lieutenant stood, talking to Colonel de Chamillard, of the French marines. The scavengers, were sweeping down, and part of the after guard was bending a new, bolt-rope on a storm staysail.\\n\\nMr. Carvel's chapter opens with Landais's sudden reappearance on the, morning of the day the battle was fought. He shows the resentment and, anger against the Frenchman felt by all on board, from cabin-boy to, commodore. But none went so far as to accuse the captain of the, 'Alliance' of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action., Cowardice may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from, the two duels in which the Richard and the Pallas engaged. But the fact, that he poured broadsides into the Richard, and into her off side, makes, it seem probable that his motive was to sink the commodore's ship, and so, get the credit of saving the day, to the detriment of the hero who won it, despite all disasters. To account for the cry that was raised when first, she attacked the Richard, it must be borne in mind that the crew of the, 'Alliance' was largely composed of Englishmen. It was thought that these, had mutinied and taken her.\\n\\nAt noon, when I relieved Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun had eaten up the, fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming, up across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind, us. I had the starboard watch piped to dinner, and reported twelve, o'clock to the commodore. And had just got permission to \\\"make it,\\\", according to a time-honoured custom at sea, when another \\\"Sail, ho!\\\" came, down from aloft.\\n\\n\\\"Charles,\\\" I said, \\\"this is all of a piece with your old recklessness., You were ever one to take any risk, but I will not hear of such a venture, as this. Do you think I will allow the hope of all England to be staked, for a pirate? And would you break our commander of her rank? All that, Dorothy need do at Portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she, meets, and I'll warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain,\\\" I said to my old friend, \\\"I have a rare joy this day in making, known to you Mr. John Paul Jones, of whom I have spoken to you a score of, times. He it is whose bravery sank the Black Moll, whose charity took me, to London, and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in, a debtors' prison. For his honour, as I have told you, would allow him, to accept none, nor his principles to take the commission in the Royal, Navy which Mr. Fox offered him.\\\"\\n\\nThe room had a prodigious sense of change about it. That came over me, with something of a shock, since the moment before I had it settled that, I was in Marlboro' Street. The bare branches swaying in the wind outside, should belong to the trees in Freshwater Lane. But beyond the branches, were houses, the like of which I had no remembrance of in Annapolis. And, then my grandfather should be sitting in that window. Surely, he was, there! He moved! He was coming toward me to say: \\\"Richard, you are, forgiven,\\\" and to brush his eyes with his ruffles.\\n\\nShe closed the door softly behind her, and stood looking down upon me, with such a wondrous love-light in her eyes as no man may describe., My fancy had not lifted me within its compass, my dreams even had not, imagined it. And the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler, souls. So she stood gazing, those lips which once had been the seat of, pride now parted in a smile of infinite tenderness. But her head she, still held high, and her body straight. Down the front of her dress fell, a tucked apron of the whitest linen, and in her hand was a cup of, steaming broth.\\n\\nmy dear. Well, when the big British fleet sailed up the bay in '77, your, precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality., He began to correspond with the British at Philadelphia, and one of his, letters was captured near the Head of Elk. A squad was sent to the Kent, estate, where he had been living, to arrest him, but he made his escape, to New York. And his lands were at once confiscated by the state.\\\"\\n\\nBringing the official news of Burgoyne's surrender, which was to cause, King Louis to acknowledge the independence of the United States, the, Ranger arrived at Nantes, December 2. Mr. Carvel accompanied Captain, Jones to Paris, where a serious blow awaited him. The American, Commissioners informed him that the Indien had been transferred to France, to prevent her confiscation. That winter John Paul spent striving in, vain for a better ship, and imbibing tactics from the French admirals., Incidentally, he obtained a salute for the American flag. The cruise of, the Ranger in English waters the following spring was a striking, fulfilment, with an absurdly poor and inadequate force, of the plan set, forth by John Paul Jones in the Annapolis Coffee House. His descent upon, Whitehaven spread terror and consternation broadcast through England, and, he was branded as a pirate and a traitor. Mr. Carvel was fortunately not, of the landing party on St. Mary's Isle, which place he had last beheld, in John Paul's company, on the brigantine John, when entering, Kirkcudbright. The object of that expedition, as is well known, was to, obtain the person of the Earl of Selkirk, in order to bring about the, rescue of the unfortunate Americans suffering in British prisons. After, the celebrated capture of the sloop-of-war Drake, Paul Jones returned to, France a hero.\\n\\nAll that morning I pondered over the devious lane of my life, which had, led up to so fair a garden. And one thing above all kept turning and, turning in my head, until I thought I should die of waiting for its, fulfilment. Now was I free to ask Dorothy to marry me, to promise her, the ease and comfort that had once been hers, should God bring us safe, back to Maryland. The change in her was little less than a marvel to me\\n\\n\\\"'Ods! Blest if I know what he is,\\\" says Mr. Claude. \\\"He may be, anything, an impostor or a high-mightiness. But he's something to strike, the eye and hold it, for all his Quaker clothes. He is swarth and, thickset, and some five feet eight inches--full six inches under your, own height. And he comes asking for you as if you owned the town between, you. 'Send a fellow to Marlboro' Street for Mr. Richard Carvel, my good, host!' says he, with a snap of his fingers. And when I tell him the news, of you, he is prodigiously affected, and cries--but here's my gentleman, now!\\\"\\n\\nI arrived at Wye Island in season to dine with the good judge and his, family, and there I made over to his charge the property of Patty and her, mother. The afternoon we spent in sober talk, Mr. Bordley giving me much, sound advice, and writing me several letters of recommendation to, gentlemen in Congress. His conduct was distinguished by even more of, kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me.\\n\\n\\\"I could answer nothing. 'Twas because of her father's dying wish I, asked her, and she guessed that same. I would not tell her a lie, for, only the one woman lives whom I love, and whom I have loved ever since, we were children together among the strawberries. Need I say that that, woman is you, Dorothy? I loved you before we sailed to Carvel Hall, between my grandfather's knees, and I will love you till death claims, me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he followed Mrs. Manners out of the room, frowning and shaking his, fist at me in mock fierceness. I would have died for the man. For a, space--a prodigious long space--I lay very still, my heart bumping like a, gun-carriage broke loose, and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door., Then I caught the sound of a light footstep, the knob turned, and joy, poured into my soul with the sweep of a Fundy tide.\\n\\nOur men raised a hoarse yell, drowned all at once by the popping of, musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about, the decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to, larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the, space between the ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports., And next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them, muzzle to muzzle below, our rammers leaning into the Serapis to send, their shot home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us, in moments of suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce, to leap a cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the, English guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign\\n\\nwhich I saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort. And I, was made to take a spoonful of something. Never, I believe, was medicine, swallowed with a greater willingness. Talk was impossible, so I lay back, in the corner and looked at her; and now and anon she would glance at my, face, with a troubled guess in her own as to how I might stand the night., For we were still in London. That I knew by the trot of our horses, and, by the granite we traversed from time to time. But at length we rumbled, over a bridge, there was a sharp call back from our post-boy to him of, the chaise behind, and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying, and creaking, which was to last the whole night long, save for the brief, stops at the post-houses.\\n\\nThe rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme, Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck. Less than three score, of the seamen were American born; near four score were British, inclusive, of sixteen Irish; one hundred and thirty-seven were French soldiers, who, acted as marines; and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight, her were from all over the earth,--Malays and Maltese and Portuguese., In the hold were more than one hundred and fifty English prisoners.\\n\\ntoo, for now am I known from Mary-le-bone to Chelsea, while before my, name was unheard of out of little Mayfair. Indeed, I would not have, missed the experience for a lady-in-waiting-ship. I have learned a deal, since I saw you last, sir. I know that the world, like our Continental, money, must not be taken for the price that is stamped upon it. And as, for the watching with you,\\\" said my lady, \\\"that had to be borne with as, cheerfully as might be. Since I had sent off for you, I was in duty, bound to do my share toward your recovery. I was even going to add, that this watching was a pleasure,--our curate says the sense of duty, performed is sure to be. But you used to cry out the most terrifying, things to frighten me: the pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies, on the decks, and the black rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never, stopped; and strange, rough commands I could not understand; and the name, of your commodore whom you love so much. And often you would repeat over, and over: 'I have not yet begun, to fight, I have not yet begun to, fight!'\\\"\\n\\nThen there was the bed-canopy, the pleatings of which were gone, and it, was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That, was unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the, mantel was now but a bit of a shelf, and held many things that seemed, scarce at home on the rough and painted wood,--gold filigree; and China, and Japan, and a French clock that ought not to have been just there., Ah, the teacups! Here at last was something to touch a fibre of my, brain, but a pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back, to my grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as, Scipio's, and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too, large for him. And he was sewing. This was monstrous!\\n\\nI turned and followed him aft to the taffrail, where we were clear of the, French soldiers. The sun was hanging red over the Yorkshire Wolds, the, Head of Flamborough was in the blue shadow, and the clouds were like rose, leaves in the sky. The enemy had tacked and was standing west, with, ensign and jack and pennant flying, the level light washing his sails to, the whiteness of paper. 'Twas then I first remarked that the Alliance, had left her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the, Serapis. The commodore seemed to read my exclamation.\\n\\nI turned my face to the wall, completely overcome, and the tears scalding, in my eyes, at the thought of Dorothy and her mother bending over the, stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood, and watching at my bedside, night and day despite their weariness of body. And not a word out of, these noble women of their sacrifice, nor of the shame and trouble and, labour of their lives, who always had been used to every luxury! Nothing, but cheer had they brought to the sickroom, and not a sign of their, poverty and hardship, for they knew that their broths and biscuit and, jellies must have choked me. No. It remained for this contemptible, cur of a husband and father to open my eyes.\\n\\nstriking everywhere, sometimes sending casks of salt water over the, nettings. Incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering, sand over the black pools that kept running, running together as the, minutes were tolled out, and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces, in a hideous contortion. One little fellow, with whom I had had many a, lively word at mess, had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went, skipping past me with the charge under his coat, and I have but to listen, now to hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him, away to the cockpit below. Out of the main hatch, from that charnel, house, rose one continuous cry. It was an odd trick of the mind or soul, that put a hymn on my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human, misery, when men were calling the name of their Maker in vain. But as, I ran from crew to crew, I sang over and over again a long-forgotten, Christmas carol, and with it came a fleeting memory of my mother on the, stairs at Carvel Hall, and of the negroes gathered on the lawn without.\\n\\nI knew full well she meant it, and the terror of losing her kept me, silent. She put down the cup, placed another pillow behind my head with, a marvellous deftness, and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls, something which was surely nectar. And mine eyes, too, had their feast., Never before had I seen my lady in this gentle guise, this task of, nursing the sick, which her doing raised to a queenly art.\\n\\nSo passed that winter, the darkest of my life. One soft spring day, when, the birds were twittering amid new-born leaves, and the hyacinths and, tulips in Patty's garden were coming to their glory, Master Tom rode, leisurely down the drive at Gordon's Pride. That was a Saturday, the, 29th of April, 1775. The news which had flown southward, night and day, alike, was in no hurry to run off his tongue; he had been lolling on the, porch for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the, minute-men of Massachusetts and the British regulars, of the rout of, Percy's panting redcoats from Concord to Boston. Tom added, with the, brutal nonchalance which characterized his dealings with his mother and, sister, that he was on his way to Philadelphia to join a company.\\n\\nThe next morning, after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me, to his heart's content, enters Mr. Marmaduke Manners. I was prodigiously, struck by the change in him, and pitied him then near as much as I had, once despised him. He was arrayed in finery, as of old. But the finery, was some thing shabby; the lace was frayed at the edges, there was a neat, but obvious patch in his small-clothes, and two more in his coat. His, air was what distressed me most of all, being that of a man who spends, his days seeking favours and getting none. I had seen too many of the, type not to know the sign of it.\\n\\nto put in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once, visited. And how much of that money do you suppose I get, sir? Will you, believe it that I--\\\" (he was shrieking now), \\\"that I, the man of the, family, am allowed only my simple meals, a farthing for snuff, and not a, groat for chaise-hire? At my age I am obliged to walk to and from their, lordships' side entrances in patched clothes, egad, when a new suit might, obtain us a handsome year's income!\\\"\\n\\nWe were married on the fifteenth of June, already an anniversary for us, both, in the long drawing-room. General Clapsaddle was there from the, army to take Dorothy in his arms, even as he had embraced another bride, on the same spot in years gone by. She wore the wedding gown that was, her mother's, but when the hour was come to dress her Aunt Lucy and Aunt, Hester failed in their task, and it was Patty who performed the most of, that office, and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck.\\n\\nAt that the commodore hurried forward, the men falling back to the, bulwarks respectfully, and he mounted the fore-rigging as agile as any, topman, followed by his aide with a glass. From the masthead he sung out, to me to set our stu'nsails, and he remained aloft till near seven bells, of the watch. At that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety, behind the head, and from the deck a great yellow King's frigate could be, plainly seen standing south to meet us, followed by her smaller consort., Presently she hove to, and through our glasses we discerned a small boat, making for her side, and then a man clambering up her sea-ladder.\\n\\nIt makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that, tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the, King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that, stood so straight upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love, and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns, piped and sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the, long roll and the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive., Breechings were loosed and gun-tackles unlashed, rammer and sponge laid, out, and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy, when the time came to rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled, over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and, canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers, rigged the splinter nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes, against those that were sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of, water to put out the fires. Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is, slippery upon the boards. The French marines, their scarlet and white, very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were, mustered on poop and forecastle, and some were sent aloft to the tops to, assist the tars there to sweep the British decks with handgrenade and, musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and, steerage, to make ready for the grimmest work of all.\\n\\nI rushed back to my guns, for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of, the Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into, play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside, into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching, together, the disordered riggings locking, and both pointed northward to, a leeward tide in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to, shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.\\n\\n\\\"The duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to London., I think my father wrote of that to Dr. Courtenay.\\\" (I smiled at the, recollection, now.) \\\"Then his Grace persisted in following me, everywhere, and vowed publicly that he would marry me. I ordered him, from our house, since my father would not. At last one afternoon he came, back to dine with us, insolent to excess. I left the table. He sat with, my father two hours or more, drinking and singing, and giving orders to, the servants. I shut my door, that I might not hear. After a while my, mother came up to me, crying, saying that Mr. Manners would be branded, with dishonour and I did not consent to marry his Grace,--a most terrible, dishonour, of which she could not speak. That the duke had given my, father a month to win my consent. And that month was up, Richard, the, very afternoon you appeared with Mr. Dix in Arlington Street.\\\"\\n\\ninstead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and, prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen, gibberish of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the, first fury of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn, at the main hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had, burst, killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them., At this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches.\\n\\nbe accused of mercenary motives. The ragged crew of the Ranger was paid, in part out of his own pocket, and for a whole month he supported the, Drake's officers and men, no provision having been made for prisoners., He was at large expense in fitting out the Ranger, and he bought back at, twice what it was worth the plate taken from St. Mary's Isle, getting but, a tardy recognition from the Earl of Selkirk for such a noble and, unheard-of action. And, I take pride in writing it, Mr. Carvel spent, much of what he had earned at Gordon's Pride in a like honourable manner.\\n\\n\\\"Richard,\\\" replied he, with an ineffable sadness, \\\"I am naught but a, wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,--no, real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom, I lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life, I must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I know that, now, and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently, broken forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a wild young creature then, my dear, with little beside vanity, under my cap. And the notion that you could admire and love any girl but, me was beyond endurance. Then his Lordship arrived in England, brimming, with praise of you, to assure me that the affair was not about Patty at, all. This was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love, with her, and I may say now that I was miserable. Then, as we were, setting out for Castle Howard, came the news of your death on the road, to Upper Marlboro. I could not go a step. Poor Jack, he was very honest, when he proposed,\\\" she added, with a sigh.\\n\\nIt was Aunt Lucy who spent the morning with me, and Mrs. Manners brought, my dinner. I observed a questioning glance as she entered, which I took, for an attempt to read whether Mr. Marmaduke had spoke more than he, ought. But I would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my, discoveries, though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern., She stayed to talk on the progress of the war, relating the gallant, storming of Stony Point by Mad Anthony in July, and the latest Tory, insurrection on our own Eastern Shore. She passed from these matters to, a discussion of General Washington's new policy of the defensive, for, Mrs. Manners had always been at heart a patriot. And whilst I lay, listening with a deep interest, in comes my lady herself. So was it, ever, when you least expected her, even as Mammy had said. She curtseyed, very prettily, with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red, and asked me, how I did.\\n\\nRichard. You must have seen even then that I loved you, dear, though, I was so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his Grace. I could not, bear to think that you knew of any stain upon our family. I think--I, think I would rather have died, or have married him. That day I threw, Chartersea's presents out of the window, but my father made the servants, gather them all which escaped breaking, and put them in the drawing-room., Then I fell ill.\\\"\\n\\nAfter an hour of it, I was holding my breath against the lurches, like a, sea-sick man against that bottomless fall of the ship's bows on the, ocean. I had no pain,--only an over whelming exhaustion,--but the joy, of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy, dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary, twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning, ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic; or, reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of, that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous, of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort\\n\\nhis successful elusions of the 'Cerberus', which hounded him, and his, escape from the 'Solebay', are too famous to be dwelt upon here., Obtaining the Alfred, he captured and brought into Boston ten thousand, suits of uniform for Washington's shivering army. Then, by the bungling, of Congress, thirteen officers were promoted over his head. The, bitterness this act engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for, distinction was as great as Captain Jones's may be imagined. To his, everlasting credit be it recorded that he remained true to the country to, which he had dedicated his life and his talents. And it was not until, 1781 that he got the justice due him.\\n\\nWe had now but one of our starboard nine-pounders on its carriage, and, word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to, scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, we did, not have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away, for, the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy', from her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the, bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of, sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and, shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull\\n\\nTo us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay., Seven times, I say, was that battle lost, and seven times regained again., What was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their, posts through that hell of flame and shot, when a madman could scarce, have hoped for victory? What but the knowledge that somewhere in the, swirl above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept, all obstacles from before him, and into whose mind the thought of defeat, could not enter. His spirit held us to our task, for flesh and blood, might not have endured alone.\\n\\nand bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet, were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound, her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the, while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew, around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress, for the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her, muff and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs, of failure.\\n\\n\\\"I would never meet it, sir,\\\" he replied instantly. \\\"That would be the, height of folly. I would divide our forces into small, swift-sailing, squadrons, of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers. And I would, carry the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade. I can name, a score of such defenceless places, and I know every shoal of their, harbours. For example, Whitehaven might be entered. That is a town of, fifty thousand inhabitants. The fleet of merchantmen might with the, greatest ease be destroyed, a contribution levied, and Ireland's coal cut, off for a winter. The whole of the shipping might be swept out of the, Clyde. Newcastle is another likely place, and in almost any of the Irish, ports valuable vessels may be found. The Baltic and West Indian fleets, are to be intercepted. I have reflected upon these matters for years\\n\\nwhatever the pain they give. And my heart aches now when I think of that, dark day in Arlington Street when I gave you the locket, and you went out, of my life. I knew that I had done wrong then, Richard, as soon as ever, the door closed behind you. I should have gone with you, for better for, worse, for richer for poorer. I should have run after you in the rain, and thrown myself at your feet. And that would have been best for my, father and for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe Serapis, too, was now beginning to blaze aloft, and choking, wood-smoke eddied out of the Richard's hold and mingled with the powder, fumes. Then the enemy's fire abreast us seemed to lull, and Mr. Stacey, mounted the bulwarks, and cried out: \\\"You have cleared their decks, my, hearties!\\\" Aloft, a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the, very top of the Englishman, where he threw a hand-grenade, as I thought\\n\\nthat this was the man of whose innermost life I had had so intimate a, view. Who had taken me to the humble cottage under Criffel, who had, poured into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together, in the dingy room of the Castle Yard sponging-house. Then some of those, ludicrous scenes on the road to London came up to me, for which the, sky-blue frock was responsible. And yet this commodore was not greatly, removed from him I had first beheld on the brigantine John. His, confidence in his future had not so much as wavered since that day. That, future was now not so far distant as the horizon, and he was ready to, meet it.\\n\\nmerciful or cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act, of coolness and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a, gunner called for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch, the rammer from Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot, through his chest. Poor Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work, 'Scolding Sairy' was to do that night. I had but dragged him beyond, reach of the recoil when he was gone.\\n\\n\\\"To speak truth, I am heartily tired of that life,\\\" said he. \\\"There is, little glory in raising nicotia, and sipping bumbo, and cursing negroes., Ho for the sea!\\\" he cried. \\\"The salt sea, and the British prizes. Give, me a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake. Mark me, Richard,\\\" he, said, a restless gleam coning into his dark eyes, \\\"stirring times are, here, and a chance for all of us to make a name.\\\" For so it seemed ever, to be with him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I am speaking the truth,\\\" he said bitterly. \\\"And I assume no virtue, for the little justice it remains in my power to do. It is the lot of my, life that I must be false to some one always, and even now I am false to, your uncle. Yes, I am come to do justice, and 'tis a strange errand for, me. I know that estates have been restored to you by the Maryland, Legislature, Richard, and I believe in my heart that you will win this, war.\\\" Here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket. \\\"But to make you, secure,\\\" said he, \\\"in the year 1710, and on the 9th of March, old style\\n\\n\\\"I do not tell you that I shall change my life, Richard, for I have said, that too many times before. Indeed, I warn you that any money you may, send will be spent in drink, and--and worse. I will be no hypocrite to, you. But I believe that I am better this hour than I have been since, last I knelt at my mother's knee in the little Oxfordshire cottage where, I was born.\\\"\\n\\nDazed, I put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet. When I, had been hit, I knew not. But I shook my head, for the very notion of, that cockpit turned my stomach. The blood was streaming from a gash in, his own temple, to which he gave no heed, and stood encouraging that, panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the, ring-bolts of its companion that lay shattered there. \\\"Serve her with, double-headed, my lads,\\\" he shouted, \\\"and every shot into the, Englishman's mainmast!\\\"\\n\\nand set off at the devil's pace for the Texel. You must know that the, whole Dutch nation was in an uproar--as much of an uproar as those boors, ever reach--over the arrival of your infamous squadron. The Court Party, and our ambassador were for having you kicked out, and the Republicans, for making you at home. I heard that their High Mightinesses had given, Paul Jones the use of the Texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners\\n\\nNot until October of that year, 1775, was the infant navy born. Mr., Carvel was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical, seamanship and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of, instructors, John Paul Jones. An interesting side light is thrown upon, the character of that hero by the fact that, with all his supreme, confidence in his ability, he applied to Congress only for a first, lieutenancy. This was in deference to the older men before that body., \\\"I hoped,\\\" said he, \\\"in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from, those of more experience than myself.\\\" His lack of assertion for once, cost him dear. He sailed on the New Providence expedition under, Commodore Hopkins as first lieutenant of the Alfred, thirty; and he soon, discovered that, instead of gaining information, he was obliged to inform, others. He trained the men so thoroughly in the use of the great guns, \\\"that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as, soldiers generally perform the manual exercise.\\\"\\n\\nwhen I remembered the wilful miss who had come to London bent upon, pleasure alone. Truly, she was of that rare metal which refines, and, then outshines all others. And there was much I could not understand., A miracle had saved her from the Duke of Chartersea, but why she had, refused so many great men and good was beyond my comprehension. Not a, glimpse of her did I get that day, though my eyes wandered little from, the knob of the door. And even from Aunt Lucy no satisfaction was to be, had as to the cause of her absence.\\n\\n'Twas at this critical moment, when that fearful battle once more was, won, another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads, and that, name which we dreaded most of all was spread again. As we halted in, consternation, a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side, and, a babel of voices hailed the treacherous Landais with oaths and, imprecations. We made out the Alliance with a full head of canvas, black, and sharp, between us and the moon. Smoke hung above her rail. Getting, over against the signal fires blazing on Flamborough Head, she wore ship, and stood across our bows, the midshipman on the forecastle singing out, to her, by the commodore's orders, to lay the enemy by the board. There, was no response.\\n\\nI hurried over to the tea-cups, such a twinge did that discovery give me., But they troubled me near as much, and the sea-coal fire held strange, images. The fascination in the window was not to be denied, for it stood, in line with the houses and the trees. Suddenly there rose up before me, a gate. Yes, I knew that gate, and the girlish figure leaning over it., They were in Prince George Street. Behind them was a mass of golden-rose, bushes, and out of these came forth a black face under a turban, saying\\n\\n\\\"Ay, that he is, with our English cruisers thick as gulls outside', waiting for a dead fish. But he has spurned the French commission they, have offered him, saying that of the Congress is good enough for him., And he declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the, Alliance under the Stars and Stripes. And for this I honour him,\\\" added, he, \\\"and Charles honours him, and so must all Englishmen honour him when, they come to their senses. And by Gads life, I believe he will get, clear, for he is a marvel at seamanship.\\\"\\n\\nand worn themselves out with nursing me. Nor did I forget the risk they, ran with such a guest. For the first time in many years my heart, relented toward Mr. Marmaduke. For their sakes I forgave him over and, over what I had suffered, and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon, me. And how was I to repay them? They needed the money I had cost them\",\n          \", [This is the last letter which I was destined to receive from my poor, friend. He started to spend the Christmas of that year (1884) with his, people, and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident, at Sittingfleet, where the express ran into a freight train which was, standing in the depot. Dr. and Mrs. Munro were the only occupants of, the car next the locomotive, and were killed instantly, as were the, brakesman and one other passenger. It was such an end as both he and, his wife would have chosen; and no one who knew them would regret that, neither was left to mourn the other. His insurance policy of eleven, hundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own, family, which, as his father was sick, was the one worldly matter which, could have caused him concern.--H. S.]\\n\\nI told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious, return from Lochtully Castle. When I had settled for the flannel vests, which my mother had ordered so lavishly I had only five pounds left out, of my pay. With this, as it was the first money that I had ever earned, im{sic} my life, I bought her a gold bangle, so behold me reduced at, once to my usual empty pocketed condition. Well, it was something just, to feel that I HAD earned money. It gave me an assurance that I might, again.\\n\\nGood-bye, old chap, and never think that I forget you. Your letters are, read and re-read with avidity. I think I have every line you ever wrote, me. You simply knock Paley out every time. I am so glad that you got out, of that brewery business all right. For a time I was really afraid that, you must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares. I can, only thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques.\\n\\n\\\"A million pounds. Not a penny under. And dirt cheap to the nation that, buys it. I shall let it go at that, though I could make ten times as, much if I held on. I shall take it up to the Secretary of the Navy in, a week or two; and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person I, shall do business with him. It's not every day, Munro, that a man comes, into his office with the Atlantic under one arm and the Pacific under, the other. Eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nSince I am upon this topic, may I say just a little more without boring, you? You say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive, and that, I have nothing to offer in place of what I pull down. This is not quite, correct. I think that there are certain elemental truths within our, grasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance, and which are, sufficient to furnish us with a practical religion, having so much of, reason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold, not drive, them forth from it.\\n\\nfrom all I can learn of him, has suddenly swung clean over from one, extreme of character to the other. Every plus has in an instant become a, minus. He's another man, but in the same case. I am told that he used, to be (only a few months ago, mind you) most fastidious in dress, and speech. Now he is a foul-tongued rough! He had a nice taste in, literature. Now he stares at you if you speak of Shakespeare. Queerest, of all, he used to be a very high-and-dry Tory in his opinions. He, is fond now of airing the most democratic views, and in a needlessly, offensive way. When I did get on terms with him at last, I found that, there was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on, politics. In substance, I am bound to say that I think his new views are, probably saner than his old ones, but the insanity lies in his sudden, reasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech.\\n\\nYou know that you are turning up your nose at me, Bertie. I can see you, do it. But I'll come off the thin ice, and you shall have nothing but, facts now. I'm afraid that I should never do for a story-teller, for the, first stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me, off, with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me.\\n\\nYou'll laugh, Bertie, but it was no laughing matter to me. He wanted, eight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either, had or had not done. Otherwise the company would remove the gas-meter., How little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting, to me was either to pay away more than half my capital, or to give up, cooking my food! I at last appeased him by a promise that I should look, into the matter, and so escaped for the moment, badly shaken but still, solvent. He gave me a good deal of information about the state of his, tubes (his own, not the gas company's) before he departed; but I had, rather lost interest in the subject since I had learned that he was, being treated by his club doctor.\\n\\nWho do you think was the first person who broke this spell of, silence? The ruffian whom I had fought under the lamp-post. He is a, scissors-grinder it seems, and rang to know if I had a job for him. I, could not help grinning at him when I opened the door and saw who it, was. He showed no sign of recognising me, however, which is hardly to be, wondered at.\\n\\nthat years ago the name of Bradfield used to strike with a causeless, familiarity upon my ear; and since then, as you know, the course of my, life has flowed through it. And so when I first saw Winnie La Force in, the railway carriage, before I had spoken to her or knew her name, I, felt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her. Have you had, no experience of the sort in your life? Or was it merely that she was, obviously gentle and retiring, and so made a silent claim upon all that, was helpful and manly in me? At any rate, I was conscious of it; and, again and again every time that I met her. How good is that saying of, some Russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole, sex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand! I thought I, knew something of women. I suppose every medical student does. But now I, can see that I really knew nothing. My knowledge was all external. I did, not know the woman soul, that crowning gift of Providence to man, which\\n\\nshe runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a, household word, and they all pretend to sympathise with her, and, agree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man. I, quarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct, and it ended, by my throwing him down the stairs. What was the result? He talked so, much about it that the whole village from which he came, sick and, well, trooped to see me. The little country practitioner who had been, buttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well, put up his shutters. It's human nature, my boy, and you can't alter it., Eh, what? You make yourself cheap and you become cheap. You put a high, price on yourself and they rate you at that price. Suppose I set up in, Harley Street to-morrow, and made it all nice and easy, with hours from, ten to three, do you think I should get a patient? I might starve first., How would I work it? I should let it be known that I only saw patients, from midnight until two in the morning, and that bald-headed people, must pay double. That would set people talking, their curiosity would, be stimulated, and in four months the street would be blocked all night., Eh, what? laddie, you'd go yourself. That's my principle here. I often, come in of a morning and send them all about their business, tell them, I'm going off to the country for a day. I turn away forty pounds, and, it's worth four hundred as an advertisement!\\\"\\n\\nWell, this made me sit down and gasp. I am, I think, one of the most, unsuspicious men upon earth, and through a certain easy-going indolence, of disposition I never even think of the possibility of those with whom, I am brought in contact trying to deceive me. It does not occur to me., But let me once get on that line of thought--let me have proof that, there is reason for suspicion--and then all faith slips completely away, from me. Now I could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at, Bradfield. Those sudden fits of ill temper, the occasional ill-concealed, animosity of Cullingworth--did they not mark the arrival of each of, my mother's letters? I was convinced that they did. He had read them, then--read them from the pockets of the little house coat which I used, to leave carelessly in the hall when I put on my professional one to go, out. I could remember, for example, how at the end of his illness his, manner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my, mother's had arrived. Yes, it was certain that he had read them from the, beginning.\\n\\nThe time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this; but, we gradually whittled it down to five and to four. My income had risen, to about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time; and Winnie had, agreed, with a somewhat enigmatical smile, that we could manage very, well on that--the more so as marriage sends a doctor's income up. The, reason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that, date I received a most portentous blue document in which \\\"We, Brown, & Woodhouse, the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned, Winifred La Force, do hereby\\\"--state a surprising number of things\\n\\nNow about the Cullingworths. Madam is as amiable as ever; and yet, somehow, unless I am deceiving myself, she has changed somewhat of late, in her feelings towards me. I have turned upon her suddenly more than, once, and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than, malignant. In one or two small matters I have also detected a hardness, in her which I had never observed before. Is it that I have intruded, too much into their family life? Have I come between the husband and the, wife? Goodness knows I have striven with all my little stock of tact to, avoid doing so. And yet I have often felt that my position was a false, one. Perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a woman's, glances and gestures. He wishes to assign a definite meaning to each\\n\\nTo commence with what is of most moment, you may rest assured that what, you said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest, attention. I am sorry that I have not got it by me to refer to (I, lent it to Charlie), but I think I have the contents in my head. It is, notorious, as you say, that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of, the orthodox, and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to, dogma. Such men are the real enemies of free thought. If anything could, persuade me to turn traitor to my reason, it would, for example, be, the blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic, journals.\\n\\nI travelled down part of the way with young Leslie Duncan, whom I think, you know. He was gracious enough to consider that a third-class carriage, and my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude. You, know that he came into his uncle's money a little time ago, and after a, first delirious outbreak, he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state, of despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for., How absurd are the ambitions of life when I think that I, who am fairly, happy and as keen as a razor edge, should be struggling for that which, I can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him! And yet, if I, can read my own nature, it is not the accumulation of money which is my, real aim, but only that I may acquire so much as will relieve my mind, of sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which I may have\\n\\nwith the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character. Always, a lady, whether she was bargaining with the butcher, or breaking in a, skittish charwoman, or stirring the porridge, which I can see her doing, with the porridge-stick in one hand, and the other holding her Revue, des deux Mondes within two inches of her dear nose. That was always her, favourite reading, and I can never think of her without the association, of its browny-yellow cover.\\n\\nYou must know, then, that within the boundaries of this city there are, two ladies, a mother and a daughter, whom I shall call Mrs. and Miss, Laura Andrews. They are patients of the governor's, and have become, to some extent friends of the family. Madame is Welsh, charming, in appearance, dignified in her manners, and High Church in her, convictions. The daughter is rather taller than the mother, but, otherwise they are strikingly alike. The mother is thirty-six and, the daughter eighteen. Both are exceedingly charming. Had I to choose, between them, I think, entre nous, that the mother would have attracted, me most, for I am thoroughly of Balzac's opinion as to the woman of, thirty. However, fate was to will it otherwise.\\n\\nAfter all, I own to you, that it might have been better had I listened, to what he had to say, and refused to give my own views. On the other, hand, truth MUST be as broad as the universe which it is to explain, and, therefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive., A protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards, truth. Who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the Almighty? It would be, an insolence on the part of a solar system, and yet it is done every, day by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers. There lies the real, impiety.\\n\\nI read over what I have written, but I can see that I give you no real, insight into the demoniac cleverness of Cullingworth. His views upon, medicine were most revolutionary, but I daresay that if things fulfil, their promise I may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel., With his brilliant and unusual gifts, his fine athletic record, his, strange way of dressing (his hat on the back of his head and his throat, bare), his thundering voice, and his ugly, powerful face, he had quite, the most marked individuality of any man that I have ever known.\\n\\nI was compelled, by the way, to forego an opening which a few months ago, would have been the very summit of my ambition. You must know (possibly, I told you), that immediately after I passed, I put my name down as a, candidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship, lines. It was done as a forlorn hope, for a man has usually to wait, several years before his turn comes round. Well, just a week after I, started here, I got a telegram one night from Liverpool: \\\"Join the Decia, to-morrow as surgeon, not later than eight in the evening.\\\" It was from, Staunton & Merivale, the famous South American firm, and the Decia is, a fine 6000-ton passenger boat, doing the round journey by Bahia and, Buenos Ayres to Rio and Valparaiso. I had a bad quarter of an hour, I, can tell you. I don't think I was ever so undecided about anything in my, life. Cullingworth was dead against my going, and his influence carried, the day.\\n\\ntickled the child, and gained over the whole household. He had these, attacks periodically, and made an arrangement with me by which I was to, deal with him, and we were to balance bills against each other. It was, a ghoulish compact, by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to, me, while a spell of health for Haywood sent me back to dry bread and, saveloys. However, it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling, which must otherwise have gone in food. At last, however, the poor, fellow died, and there was our final settlement.\\n\\na selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her, attacks, insisting upon my carrying them away then and there; so that I, stagger out of the house like one of Napoleon's generals coming out of, Italy. There is a good deal of method in the old lady, however, and on, her recovery she invariably sends round a porter, with a polite note to, say that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again.\\n\\nthinking that it was an accident, but an instant afterwards I received, another and a harder one. I dropped my paper with a growl, but the, moment that I glanced at him I saw how the matter stood. His foot was, jerking spasmodically, his two hands clenched, and drumming against his, breast, while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his, iris was to be seen. I sprang upon him, tore open his collar, unbuttoned, his waistcoat, and pulled his head down upon the seat. Crash went one of, his heels through the carriage window, but I contrived to sit upon his, knees while I kept hold of his two wrists.\\n\\nWell, I was averse from going myself, but Winnie was all for peace and, forgiveness. Women who claim nothing invariably get everything, and so, my gentle little wife always carries her point. Half an hour later I was, in Cadogan Terrace with very mixed feelings, but the kindlier ones at, the top. I tried to think that Cullingworth's treatment of me had been, pathological--the result of a diseased brain. If a delirious man had, struck me, I should not have been angry with him. That must be my way of, looking at it.\\n\\n\\\"You may label me as you like,\\\" I answered (and by this time I fear that, I had got my preaching stop fairly out); \\\"I don't pretend to know what, truth is, for it is infinite, and I finite; but I know particularly well, what it is NOT. It is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen, hundred years ago, and that we are for ever to refer back to what was, written and said in those days. No, sir; religion is a vital living, thing, still growing and working, capable of endless extension and, development, like all other fields of thought. There were many eternal, truths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book, some parts, of which may indeed be called holy. But there are others yet to be, revealed; and if we are to reject them because they are not in those, pages, we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice, of Kirschoff's spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in, Albertus Magnus. A modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write, to the magazines; but none the less he may be the little pipe which, conveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth. Look at this!\\\" I, cried, rising and reading my Carlyle text. \\\"That comes from no Hebrew, prophet, but from a ratepayer in Chelsea. He and Emerson are also among, the prophets. The Almighty has not said His last say to the human race\\n\\nAnd first of all, a thousand thanks for your two long letters, which lie, before me as I write. There is little enough personal news in them, but, I can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels, off very smoothly from week to week. On the other hand, you give me, plenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more, interesting. After all, we may very well agree to differ. You think, some things are proved which I don't believe in. You think some things, edifying which do not appear to me to be so. Well, I know that you are, perfectly honest in your belief. I am sure you give me credit for being, the same. The future wilt decide which of us is right. The survival of, the truest is a constant law, I fancy, though it must be acknowledged, that it is very slow in action.\\n\\n\\\"Too provincial, my boy! What's the good of a village practice with, a miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to, spread? My head was sticking out at one end of Bradfield and my feet at, the other. Why, there wasn't room for Hetty in the place, let alone, me! I've taken to the eye, my boy. There's a fortune in the eye. A man, grudges a half-crown to cure his chest or his throat, but he'd spend his, last dollar over his eye. There's money in ears, but the eye is a gold, mine.\\\"\\n\\nshoved them against the wall, and occasionally rushed out to the head, of the stair to address them en masse. At the same time, behind all, this tomfoolery, I, watching his prescriptions, could see a quickness of, diagnosis, a scientific insight, and a daring and unconventional use of, drugs, which satisfied me that he was right in saying that, under all, this charlatanism, there lay solid reasons for his success. Indeed\\n\\nIt was some weeks, however, before I gained his confidence, so far as, to be able to hold a real conversation with him. For a long time he was, very sullen and suspicious, resenting the constant watch which I kept, upon him. This could not be relaxed, for he was full of the most apish, tricks. One day he got hold of my tobacco pouch, and stuffed two ounces, of my tobacco into the long barrel of an Eastern gun which hangs on the, wall. He jammed it all down with the ramrod, and I was never able to get, it up again. Another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the, window, and would have sent the clock after it had I not prevented, him. Every day I took him for a two hours' constitutional, save when it, rained, and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down, the room. Heh! but it was a deadly, dreary, kind of life.\\n\\nThis took some thinking out. It had an ugly sound, but I gathered that, she meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since, these gentlemen were satisfied. So the bargain was struck, and I ordered, tea to be ready in an hour, while I went back to the station to fetch up, my luggage. A porter brought it up for eightpence (saving fourpence on, a cab, my boy!) and so I found myself in the heart of Birchespool with, a base of operations secured. I looked out of the little window of my, lodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs, with a spire or, two spurting up among them, and I shook my teaspoon defiantly at them., \\\"You've got to conquer me,\\\" said I, \\\"or else I'm man enough to conquer, you.\\\"\\n\\nSo, after much argument, it ended in the kind fellow going off and, leaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table. The money, burned my fingers, for I knew that his pension was not a very large one;, and yet, since I could not avoid taking it, there was no denying that it, was exceedingly useful. Out I sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it, upon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my, bed. Already, you see, I was getting to a state of enervating luxury, in my household arrangements, and I could only lull my conscience by, reminding myself that little Paul would have to sleep with me when he, came.\\n\\nor else may be taken as marking the tombs of Anglican chiefs, the, lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping. This had been explained, by the Patagonian school as being a universal system of, lightning-conductors. He (the lecturer) could not assent to this theory., In a series of observations, extending over several months, he had, discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing, if followed, out, invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were, connected with furnaces. No one who knew how addicted the ancient, Britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant., Evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central, chamber, and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the, tubes to the house of every citizen, so that he might inhale it at will., Having illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams, the lecturer, concluded by saying that, although true science was invariably cautious, and undogmatic, it was none the less an incontestable fact that so, much light had been thrown upon old London, that every action of the, citizens' daily life was known, from the taking of a tub in the morning\\n\\nnow that I come to think of it, I have never enjoyed very much of your, confidence in return. But that may be my fault. Perhaps you don't find, me sympathetic, even though I have every wish to be. I can only say that, I find you intensely so, and perhaps I presume too much upon the fact., But no, every instinct in my nature tells me that I don't bore you by my, confidences.\\n\\nAnd all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news. It is, that I had a telegram from Cullingworth this morning--after nine months', silence. It was dated from Avonmouth, the town where I had suspected, that he had settled, and it said simply, \\\"Come at once. I have urgent, need of you. CULLINGWORTH.\\\" Of course, I shall go by the first train, to-morrow. It may mean anything or nothing. In my heart of hearts I hope, and believe that old Cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his, partner or in some other way. I always believed that he would turn up, trumps, and make my fortune as well as his own. He knows that if I am, not very quick or brilliant I am fairly steady and reliable. So that's, what I've been working up to all along, Bertie, that to-morrow I go to, join Cullingworth, and that it looks as if there was to be an opening, for me at last. I gave you a sketch of him and his ways, so that you may, take an interest in the development of my fortune, which you could not, do if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand, to me.\\n\\n, Do you think that such a thing as chance exists? Rather an explosive, sentence to start a letter with; but pray cast your mind back over your, own life, and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of, chance. You know how often the turning down this street or that, the, accepting or rejecting of an invitation, may deflect the whole current, of our lives into some other channel. Are we mere leaves, fluttered, hither and thither by the wind, or are we rather, with every conviction, that we are free agents, carried steadily along to a definite and, pre-determined end? I confess that as I advance through life, I become, more and more confirmed in that fatalism to which I have always had an, inclination.\\n\\nWell, I made the most dreadful fool of myself. At first, the good lady, who (as I think I told you) is very dignified and rather reserved, could, not believe her senses. Then, as the full force of my enormity came upon, her she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest, woman I had ever seen. It was an interview with a refrigerator. She, asked me what I had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged, me to subject her to such an outrage. I saw, of course, that any excuses, upon my part would put her on the right track and give poor Laura away;, so I stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand, presenting\\n\\nand two layers of them squatting in the cellar? Well, that's my house of, business on an average day. The folk come in from the county fifty miles, off, and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep, so as to be first in, when the housekeeper comes down. The medical officer of health made an, official complaint of the over-crowding of my waiting-rooms. They wait, in the stables, and sit along the racks and under the horses' bellies., I'll turn some of 'em on to you, my boy, and then you'll know a little, more about it.\\\"\\n\\nI walked down to the Park, which is the chief centre of the place, and I, found that I liked everything I saw of it. It was a lovely evening, and, the air was fresh and sweet. I sat down and listened to the band for an, hour, watching all the family parties, and feeling particularly lonely., Music nearly always puts me into the minor key; so there came a time, when I could stand it no longer, and I set off to find my way back to my, lodgings. On the whole, I felt that Birchespool was a place in which a, man might very well spend a happy life.\\n\\n\\\"The best dispenser in the world!\\\" cried Cullingworth, patting her on, the shoulder. \\\"You see how I do it, Munro. I write on a label what the, prescription is, and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged., The man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon, hole. Hetty makes it up, passes out the bottle, and takes the money., Now, come on and clear some of these folk out of the house.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Williams and I stood for five minutes without a word, hushed by the, presence of that supreme fact. Then we laid him straight, and drew the, sheet over him. She knelt down and prayed and sobbed, while I sat on, the bed, with the cold hand in mine. Then my heart turned to lead as I, remembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the, moral principles of right and wrong. But when you look closely it is a, question whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not, prove to have been a right to the interests of posterity. That sounds, a little foggy; but I will make my meaning more clear when I say that, I think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those, great hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe, that both, are making for improvement; but that the action of the one is immediate\\n\\nso they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks. They have the, most singular notions about medicines. \\\"It's that strong that a spoon, will stand oop in't!\\\" is one man's description. Above all, they love to, have two bottles, one with a solution of citric acid, and the other with, carbonate of soda. When the mixture begins to fizz, they realise that, there is indeed a science of medicine.\\n\\n\\\"Deuced interesting thing, Munro,\\\" said he. \\\"Come and look at this, temperature chart. I've been taking it every quarter of an hour since I, couldn't sleep, and it's up and down till it looks like the mountains in, the geography books. We'll have some drugs in--eh, what, Munro?--and by, Crums, we'll revolutionise all their ideas about fevers. I'll write a, pamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean, out of date, and they'll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And there is one more thing, Mr. Detective, sir,\\\" said Whitehall, explosively. \\\"I'm not a rich man, sir, only the ---- half-pay skipper, of an armed transport; but by ----, sir, I'd give you this hat full of, dollars to know the name of the ---- rascal who wrote that anonymous, letter, sir. By ---- sir, you'd have a real case to look after then.\\\", And he waved his black thorn ferociously.\\n\\nWell, I sat down there and brooded. In my heart I did not believe that, Cullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease. That could not, have been his real reason for driving me from the practice. He had found, me in the way in his domestic life, no doubt, and he had devised, this excuse for getting rid of me. Whatever the reason was, it was, sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice\\n\\ninto forced smiles when I had asked him point blank what was the matter?, One obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without, telling also how he had acquired his information. But I knew enough of, Cullingworth's resource to feel that he could easily have got over such, a difficulty as that. In fact, in this last letter he HAD got over it, by his tale about the grate and the maid. He must have had some stronger, reason for restraint. As I thought over the course of our relations I, was convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until I had, committed myself, and then to abandon me, so that I should myself have, no resource but to compound with my creditors-to be, in fact, that which, my mother had called him.\\n\\nWisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme, of Nature. What proof do we want, then, from a book? If the man who, observes the myriad stars, and considers that they and their innumerable, satellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens, each, swinging clear of the other's orbit--if, I say, the man who sees this, cannot realise the Creator's attributes without the help of the book of, Job, then his view of things is beyond my understanding. Nor is it only, in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some, intelligent force. Nothing is too tiny for that fostering care. We see, the minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the, calyx of the flower, the most microscopic hair and gland each with its, definite purposeful function to perform. What matter whether these came, by special creation or by evolution? We know as a matter of fact that, they came by evolution, but that only defines the law. It does not, explain it.\\n\\nWell, we all work back again by two o'clock, when we find dinner waiting, for us. We may or may not have finished our rounds. If not away we go, again. If we have, Horton dictates his prescriptions, and strides off, to bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth. He is the most abandoned, smoker I have ever met with, collecting the dottles of his pipes in, the evening, and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the, stable yard. When he has departed for his nap, McCarthy and I get to, work on the medicine. There are, perhaps, fifty bottles to put up, with, pills, ointment, etc. It is quite half-past four before we have them all, laid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids. Then we have, an hour or so of quiet, when we smoke or read, or box with the coachman, in the harness room. After tea the evening's work commences. From six to, nine people are coming in for their medicine, or fresh patients wishing, advice. When these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases, which may be on the list; and so, about ten o'clock, we may hope to have, another smoke, and perhaps a game of cards. Then it is a rare thing for, a night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a, case which may take us two hours, or may take us ten. Hard work, as you, see; but Horton is such a good chap, and works so hard himself, that one, does not mind what one does. And then we are all like brothers in the, house; our talk is just a rattle of chaff, and the patients are as, homely as ourselves, so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of, us.\\n\\nBut we were demoralised by luxury. We could no longer manage without a, helper--especially now in the winter time, when fires had to be lit--the, most heart-breaking task that a man can undertake. I bethought me of, the quiet Miss Williams, and hunted her up in her shop. She was quite, willing to come, and saw how she could get out of the rent; but the, difficulty lay with her stock. This sounded formidable at first, but, when I came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings, it, did not appear insurmountable. In half an hour my watch was pawned, and, the affair concluded. I returned with an excellent housekeeper, and, with a larger basketful of inferior Swedish matches, bootlaces, cakes of, black lead, and little figures made of sugar than I should have thought, it possible to get for the money. So now we have settled down, and I, hope that a period of comparative peace lies before us.\\n\\nI nearly snatched it out of his hands. Then away I ran to take, possession of my property. Never shall I forget my feelings, my dear, Bertie, when the key clicked in the lock, and the door flew open. It was, my own house--all my very own! I shut the door again, the noise of the, street died down, and I had, in that empty, dust-strewn hall, such a, sense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before. In all my life, it was the first time that I had ever stood upon boards which were not, paid for by another.\\n\\nAnd then as I walked back I considered how far I could avail myself of, this money from Cullingworth. It was not much, but it would be madness, to start without it, for I had sent home the little which I had saved at, Horton's. I had not more than six pounds in the whole world. I reflected, that the money could make no difference to Cullingworth, with his large, income, while it made a vast one to me. I should repay him in a year, or two at the latest. Perhaps I might get on so well as to be able to, dispense with it almost at once. There could be no doubt that it was the, representations of Cullingworth as to my future prospects in Bradfield, which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the Decia. I need, not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance, from his hands. On my return, I told him that I had decided to do so\\n\\nWhen the auction was over, I paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on, to a trolly, the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings., I found that I had over-estimated the cost of furnishing, for the total, expense was little more than three pounds. We walked round to Oakley, Villa, and I proudly deposited all my goods in the hall. And here came, another extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes. The, porter when I had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a, huge mat of oakum, as ugly a thing as I have ever set eyes upon. This he, laid down inside my door, and then without a word, brushing aside every, remonstrance or attempt at thanks, he vanished away with his trolly into, the night.\\n\\nfor a short spell I could manage to live on a couple of pence a day; but, what I am doing now is not to be a mere spurt, but my regular mode of, life for many a month to come. My tea and sugar and milk (Swiss), come collectively to one penny a day. The loaf is at twopence, three-farthings, and I consume one a day. My dinner consists in, rotation of one third of a pound of bacon, cooked over the gas (twopence, halfpenny), or two saveloys (twopence), or two pieces of fried, fish (twopence), or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of Chicago beef, (twopence). Any one of these, with a due allowance of bread and water\\n\\nBut once inside, there was so much to be done that I did not know what, I should turn to first. I bought a one-and-ninepenny broom and set to, work. You notice that I am precise about small sums, because just there, lies the whole key of the situation. In the yard I found a zinc pail, with a hole in it, which was most useful, for by its aid I managed to, carry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped. Then with my new, broom, my coat hung on a gas-bracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the, elbow, I cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall, brushing the refuse, into the yard. After that I did as much for the upper floor, with the, result that I brought several square yards of dust down into the hall, again, and undid my previous cleaning. This was disheartening, but at, least it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future. When I had, finished, I was as hot and dirty as if it were half-time at a football, match. I thought of our tidy charwoman at home, and realised what, splendid training she must be in.\\n\\nHis mind runs rather on naval architecture at present, and he has been, devising an ingenious method of preventing wooden-sided vessels from, being crippled by artillery fire. I did not think much of his magnetic, attractor, because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success, that he claimed for it, it would merely have the effect of substituting, some other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells. This new, project has, however, more to recommend it. This is the idea, as put in, his own words; and, as he has been speaking of little else for the last, two days, I ought to remember them.\\n\\nwhen we think of the more advanced type of young man, we picture him as, bald, and with double eye-glasses. I am an absolute animal myself, and, my only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going. On the, other hand, there is some evidence in favour of the development of a, sixth sense-that of perception. If I had it now I should know that you, are heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism.\\n\\nI confess that I have never been able to understand the position of the, atheist. In fact, I have come to disbelieve in his existence, and, to look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach. It may, represent a temporary condition, a passing mental phase, a defiant, reaction against an anthropomorphic ideal; but I cannot conceive that, any man can continue to survey Nature and to deny that there are laws at, work which display intelligence and power. The very existence of a world, carries with it the proof of a world-maker, as the table guarantees, the pre-existence of the carpenter. Granting this, one may form what, conception one will of that Maker, but one cannot be an atheist.\\n\\nwhich should keep parallel with his medical one, were for ever at an, end. On the whole, bearing in mind my mother's opposition, and the, continual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks, I was, not very sorry. On the contrary, a sudden curious little thrill of, happiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff, and, as a, drift of rooks passed cawing over my head, I began cawing also in the, overflow of my spirits.\\n\\nThe unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased, to deserve the name. You remember that in my last I had received my, dismissal, and was on the eve of starting for the little country town, of Stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there., Well, in the morning, before I came down to breakfast, I was putting one, or two things into a bag, when there came a timid knock at my door, and, there was Mrs. Cullingworth in her dressing-jacket, with her hair down, her back.\\n\\n\\\"You'll forgive me for saying, Dr. Munro, sir, that you are a ---- lucky, fellow,\\\" said he. \\\"You've put your hand in the bag, sir, and taken out, the eel first time, as any one with half an eye can see. Now, I've had, three dips, and landed a snake every dip. If I'd had a good woman at my, side, Dr. Munro, sir, I might not be the broken half-pay skipper of an, armed transport to-day.\\\"\\n\\nFred was a little better during the day, and even seemed in a dull, sort of way to recognise his sister, who brought him flowers in the, afternoon. Towards evening his temperature sank to 101.5@, and he, fell into a kind of stupor. As it happened, Dr. Porter came in about, supper-time, and I asked him if he would step up and have a look at my, patient. He did so, and we found him dozing peacefully. You would hardly, think that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous, in my life. It was the merest chance in the world that Porter went up at, all.\\n\\nthe coachman, Mrs. Cullingworth, and the coachman's wife. We dug, foundations, got bricks in by the cartload, made our own mortar, and I, think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it. It's not quite, as flat-chested as we could wish; and I think that if I were a horse, inside it, I should be careful about brushing against the walls;, but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished., Cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves; but as, we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing, need.\\n\\nOf course, I told him that his views were diabolical; but, especially, since that warning which I had from his wife, I discount everything, that he says. He begins in earnest; but as he goes on the humour of, exaggeration gets hold of him, and he winds up with things which he, would never uphold in cold blood. However, the fact remains that we, differ widely in our views of professional life, and I fear that we may, come to grief over the question.\\n\\nWell, there the matter might have ended; but about three days afterwards, who should be shown into my consulting room but Mrs. La Force and her, daughter. I thought the latter looked twice at me, when her mother, introduced her, as if she had some recollection of my face; but she, evidently could not recall where she had seen it, and I said nothing to, help her. They both seemed to be much distressed in mind--indeed\\n\\nInstead of \\\"pulling himself together,\\\" he very nearly knocked me, asunder. I was all abroad for an instant. He had turned on me like a, flash, and had struck me on the throat just under the chin, my head, being a little back at the moment. It made me swallow once or twice, I, can tell you. Sudden as the blow was, I had countered, in the automatic, sort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does. It was only, from the elbow, with no body behind it, but it served to stave him off, for the moment, while I was making inquiries about my windpipe. Then, in he came with a rush; and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of, delight, we were pushed, almost locked in each other's arms on to that, big pedestal of which I have spoken. \\\"Go it, little 'un!\\\" \\\"Give him, beans!\\\" yelled the mob, who had lost all sight of the origin of the, fray, and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter, man. So there, my dear Bertie, was I, within a few hours of my entrance, into this town, with my top-hat down to my ears, my highly professional, frock-coat, and my kid gloves, fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal, in one of the most public places, in the heart of a yelling and hostile, mob! I ask you whether that was cruel luck or not?\\n\\nas far as I have ever been able to observe it, has been that it allows, the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other, men could only reach by hard work. In this sense Cullingworth was the, greatest genius that I have ever known. He never seemed to work, and yet, he took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the ten-hour-a-day, men. That might not count for much, for he was quite capable of idling, ostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night; but, start a subject of your own for him, and then see his originality and, strength. Talk about torpedoes, and he would catch up a pencil, and on, the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some, novel contrivance for piercing a ship's netting and getting at her side\\n\\nI remember how struck I was when first I saw the actual cautery applied, in a case of spinal disease. The white hot iron was pressed firmly into, the patient's back, without the use of any anaesthetic, and what with, the sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh I felt faint and ill., Yet, to my astonishment, the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle, of his face, and on my inquiring afterwards, he assured me that the, proceeding was absolutely painless, a remark which was corroborated, by the surgeon. \\\"The nerves are so completely and instantaneously, destroyed,\\\" he explained, \\\"that they have no time to convey a painful, impression.\\\" But then if this be so, what becomes of all the martyrs, at the stake, and the victims of Red Indians, and other poor folk, over whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered? It may be that, Providence is not only not cruel itself, but will not allow man to be, cruel either. Do your worst, and it will step in with a \\\"No, I won't, allow this poor child of mine to be hurt\\\"; and then comes the dulling, of the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of, the tormentor. David Livingstone under the claws of the lion must have, looked like an object lesson of the evil side of things, and yet he has, left it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than, otherwise. I am well convinced that if the newly-born infant and the man, who had just died could compare their experiences, the former would have, proved to be the sufferer. It is not for nothing that the first thing, the newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and, protest energetically against fate.\\n\\nPerhaps it was too bad of me to say that. I might have guarded without, countering. Anyhow; it had the effect of ending an interview which was, becoming oppressive. My visitor was too indignant to answer, and swept, out of the room without a word. From my window I could see him hurry, down the street, a little black angry thing, very hot and troubled, because he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and, compasses.\\n\\nI face my study window as I write, Bertie. Slate-coloured clouds with, ragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead. Between them one has a, glimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray. I can hear the gentle swish, of the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller, among the leaves. Sometimes it falls straight and heavy, till the air is, full of the delicate gray shading, and for half a foot above the ground, there is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules. Then, without any change in the clouds it cases off again. Pools line my walk\\n\\nso I climbed out of bed, gathered a little heap of tobacco-dust from the, linings of my pocket, and smoked the whole thing over. That life-belt of, which I had spoken so confidingly had burst, and left me to kick as best, I might in very deep water. I read the note over and over again; and for, all my dilemma, I could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and, stupidity of the thing. The picture of the host and hostess busying, themselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest, struck me as one of the funniest things I could remember. And there, was the stupidity of it, because surely a child could have seen that my, mother's attack was in answer to my defence. Why should we write a duet, each saying the same thing? Well, I'm still very confused about it all\\n\\nand I knew that her mother's will was her law, and that her course, was already marked out for her. However, we exchanged our little, confidences, and met occasionally by appointment, and tried to make our, lives brighter without darkening those of any one else. I can see you, shake your head here and growl, like the comfortable married man that, you are, that such relations are very dangerous. So they are, my boy:, but neither of us cared, she out of innocence and I out of recklessness\\n\\n\\\"Your letter to hand. Why not call me a liar at once? I tell you that I, have seen thirty thousand patients in the last year. My actual takings, have been over four thousand pounds. All patients come to me. Would not, cross the street to see Queen Victoria. You can have all visiting, all, surgery, all midwifery. Make what you like of it. Will guarantee three, hundred pounds the first year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may knock,\\\" said he, when I began to percuss his chest, \\\"but I am, ---- sure there's no one at home. They've all gone visiting one another., Sir John Hutton had a try some years ago. 'Why, dammy, man, where's your, liver?' said he. 'Seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a, porridge stick,' said he. 'Nothing is in its right place.' 'Except, my heart, Sir John,' said I. 'Aye, by ----, that will never lose its, moorings while it has a flap left.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I have written to you about my practice, and I've wired to you, about it, and here you sit asking me if I work it in two rooms. I'll, have to hire the market square before I've finished, and then I won't, have space to wag my elbows. Can your imagination rise to a great house, with people waiting in every room, jammed in as tight as they'll fit\\n\\nWell, it ended by lord and lacquey moving off, and leaving me with my, patient. I thought that I should lose no time in establishing a kindly, relation with him, so I drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask, him a few questions about his health and habits. Not a word could I get, out of him in reply. He sat as sullen as a mule, with a kind of sneer, about his handsome face, which showed me very well that he had heard, everything. I tried this and tried that, but not a syllable could I, get from him; so at last I turned from him and began to look over some, illustrated papers on the table. He doesn't read, it seems, and will do, nothing but look at pictures. Well, I was sitting like this with my back, half turned, when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking, gently at me, and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into, my coat pocket. I caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round, but too, late to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind, the Hon. James Derwent, who sat grinning at me like a mischievous, monkey.\\n\\nif we do not ourselves degrade it, will set an edge to all that is good, in us. I did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a man's whole, life and every action with unselfishness. I did not know how easy it is, to be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be, so; or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes, instead of two. I had much to learn, you see; but I think I have learned, it.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Munro\\\" (this was the style of the thing), \\\"why was armour, abandoned, eh? What! I'll tell you why. It was because the weight of, metal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he, could carry. But battles are not fought now-a-days by men who are, standing up. Your infantry are all lying on their stomachs, and it would, take very little to protect them. And steel has improved, Munro! Chilled, steel! Bessemer! Bessemer! Very good. How much to cover a man? Fourteen, inches by twelve, meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance., A notch at one side for the rifle. There you have it, laddie--the, Cullingworth patent portable bullet-proof shield! Weight? Oh, the weight, would be sixteen pounds. I worked it out. Each company carries its, shields in go-carts, and they are served out on going into action. Give, me twenty thousand good shots, and I'll go in at Calais and come out at, Pekin. Think of it, my boy! the moral effect. One side gets home every, time and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates. No, troops would stand it. The nation that gets it first will pitchfork the, rest of Europe over the edge. They're bound to have it--all of them., Let's reckon it out. There's about eight million of them on a war, footing. Let us suppose that only half of them have it. I say only half\\n\\nWe are at one, he and I, in thinking that the infinite is beyond our, perception. We differ only in that he sees evil and I see good in the, working of the universe. Ah, what a mystery it all is! Let us be honest, and humble and think kindly of each other. There's a line of stars all, winking at me over the opposite roof--winking slyly at the silly little, person with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never, understand.\\n\\nWe came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd, waiting for our chance. Presently up went a very neat little table. I, gave a nod and got it for nine shillings. Then three rather striking, looking chairs, black wood and cane bottoms. Four shillings each I gave, for those. Then a metal umbrella-stand, four and sixpence. That was a, mere luxury, but I was warming to the work. A job lot of curtains all, tied together in a bundle went up. Somebody bid five shillings. The, auctioneer's eye came round to me, and I nodded. Mine again for five, and sixpence. Then I bought a square of red drugget for half-a-crown\\n\\nThen I pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which I had, from the first determined upon as my bedchamber. I found an old packing, case in the yard--a relic of my predecessor's removal--and this made a, very good wash-hand stand for my basin and jug. When it was all fixed up, I walked, swelling with pride, through my own chambers, giving a touch, here and a touch there until I had it perfect. I wish my mother could, see it--or, on second thoughts, I don't; for I know that her first act, would be to prepare gallons of hot water, and to holystone the whole, place down, from garret to cellar--and I know by my own small experience, what that means.\\n\\nThere, now, you see what comes of waving the red rag! Let me make, a concession to appease you. I do believe that Christianity in its, different forms has been the very best thing for the world during all, this long barbarous epoch. Of course, it has been the best thing, else, Providence would not have permitted it. The engineer knows best what, tools to use in strengthening his own machine. But when you say that, this is the best and last tool which will be used, you are laying down, the law a little too much.\\n\\nthough open to attacks of romance. I can recollect her coming to see me, at a junction through which my train passed, with a six months' absence, on either side of the incident. We had five minutes' conversation, my, head out of the carriage window. \\\"Wear flannel next your skin, my dear, boy, and never believe in eternal punishment,\\\" was her last item of, advice as we rolled out of the station. Then to finish her portrait, I need not tell you, who have seen her, that she is young-looking and, comely to be the mother of about thirty-five feet of humanity. She, was in the railway carriage and I on the platform the other day. \\\"Your, husband had better get in or we'll go without him,\\\" said the guard. As, we went off, the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket, and I know, that she was looking for a shilling.\\n\\nI may be doing you an injustice, Bertie, but it seemed to me in, your last that there were indications that the free expression of my, religious views had been distasteful to you. That you should disagree, with me I am prepared for; but that you should object to free and honest, discussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest, over, would, I confess, be a disappointment. The Freethinker is placed, at this disadvantage in ordinary society, that whereas it would be, considered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox, opinion, no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees., There was a time when it took a brave man to be a Christian. Now it, takes a brave man not to be. But if we are to wear a gag, and hide our, thoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimate----no, but I, won't believe it. You and I have put up too many thoughts together and, chased them where-ever{sic} they would double, Bertie; so just write to, me like a good fellow, and tell me that I am an ass. Until I have that, comforting assurance, I shall place a quarantine upon everything which, could conceivably be offensive to you.\\n\\nAnd so the matter blew over; but I very much fear, Bertie, that this is, the first row of a series. I have a presentiment that sooner or later my, position here will become untenable. Still, I shall give it a fair trial, as long as he will let me. Cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have, nothing but inferiors and dependants round him. Now, I like to stand on, my own legs, and think with my own mind. If he'll let me do this we'll, get along very well; but if I know the man he will claim submission\\n\\nwhite-haired, old Roman Catholic priest, who had sat quietly reading his, office in the corner. We fell into the most intimate talk, which lasted, all the way to Avonmouth--indeed, so interested was I that I very nearly, passed through the place without knowing it. Father Logan (for that was, his name) seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should, be--self-sacrificing and pure-minded, with a kind of simple cunning, about him, and a deal of innocent fun. He had the defects as well as the, virtues of his class, for he was absolutely reactionary in his views., We discussed religion with fervour, and his theology was somewhere, about the Early Pliocene. He might have chattered the matter over with, a priest of Charlemagne's Court, and they would have shaken hands after, every sentence. He would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit., It was consistency in his eyes. If our astronomers and inventors and, law-givers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation, be? Is religion the only domain of thought which is non-progressive, and, to be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago?, Can they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider, outlook? A half-formed brain makes a half-formed God, and who shall say, that our brains are even half-formed yet? The truly inspired priest is, the man or woman with the big brain. It is not the shaven patch on the, outside, but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of, election.\\n\\nMind, my dear Bertie, I do not wish to run down your view or that of any, other man. We who claim toleration should be the first to extend it, to others. I am only indicating my own position, as I have often done, before. And I know your reply so well. Can't I hear your grave voice, saying \\\"Have faith!\\\" Your conscience allows you to. Well, mine won't, allow me. I see so clearly that faith is not a virtue, but a vice. It is, a goat which has been herded with the sheep. If a man deliberately shut, his physical eyes and refused to use them, you would be as quick as any, one in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to Nature. And yet you, would counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift, the reason, and, to refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life.\\n\\nCullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as, I had advised, and that he would let me know the result in a few days., Mrs. C. would hardly shake hands with me when I said goodbye; but I like, her the better for that. He must have a great deal of good in him, or he, could not have won her love and confidence so completely. Perhaps there, is another Cullingworth behind the scenes--a softer, tenderer man, who, can love and invite love. If there is, I have never got near him. And, yet I may only have been tapping at the shell. Who knows? For that, matter, it is likely enough that he has never got at the real Johnnie, Munro. But you have, Bertie; and I think that you've had a little too, much of him this time, only you encourage me to this sort of excess by, your sympathetic replies. Well, I've done as much as the General Post, Office will carry for fivepence, so I'll conclude by merely remarking, that a fortnight has passed, and that I have had no news from Avonmouth\\n\\nI often have my doubts, Bertie, if there is such a thing as the, existence of evil? If we could honestly convince ourselves that there, was not, it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion., But don't let us strain truth even for such an object as that. I must, confess that there are some forms of vice, cruelty for example, for, which it is hard to find any explanation, save indeed that it is a, degenerate survival of that war-like ferocity which may once have been, of service in helping to protect the community. No; let me be frank, and, say that I can't make cruelty fit into my scheme. But when you find that, other evils, which seem at first sight black enough, really tend in, the long run to the good of mankind, it may be hoped that those which, continue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some, fashion which is now inexplicable.\\n\\nI left my baggage at the office, and jumped into a tramcar which was, passing the station, with the intention of looking for lodgings, as, I judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel. The conductor, interested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think, that the poorer classes in England are one of the kindliest races on, earth. Policemen, postmen, railway guards, busmen, what good helpful, fellows they all are! This one reckoned the whole thing out, how this, street was central but dear, and the other was out-of-the-way but cheap\\n\\n\\\"I am quite convinced that what you say is true,\\\" he answered; \\\"but Lady, Saltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas, into him. You know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason, with a lady. However, I have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if, you would see Lady Saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood, your views upon this point, and that you are personally a supporter of a, Hereditary Chamber.\\\"\\n\\nWith all respect to you, Bertie, it is very easy to be orthodox. A man, who wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would, certainly choose to be so. As Smiles says--\\\"A dead fish can float with, the stream, but it takes a man to swim against it.\\\" What could be more, noble than the start and the starter of Christianity? How beautiful, the upward struggle of an idea, like some sweet flower blossoming out, amongst rubble and cinders! But, alas! to say that this idea was a final, idea! That this scheme of thought was above the reason! That this, gentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even, imagine a personality without irreverence!--all this will come to rank, with the strangest delusions of mankind. And then how clouded has become, that fine daybreak of Christianity! Its representatives have risen from, the manger to the palace, from the fishing smack to the House of Lords., Nor is that other old potentate in the Vatican, with his art treasures\\n\\nAfter all, true science must be synonymous with religion, since science, is the acquirement of fact; and facts are all that we have from which to, deduce what we are and why we are here. But surely the more we pry into, the methods by which results are brougt{sic} about, the more stupendous, and wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind, the, power which drifts the solar system in safety through space, and, yet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the, honey-bearing flower. What is that central intelligence? You may fit, up your dogmatic scientist with a 300-diameter microscope, and with a, telescope with a six-foot speculum, but neither near nor far can he get, a trace of that great driving power.\\n\\n\\\"they are in a sense relations of yours. You are very closely allied to, the Percies, and the Saltires have Percy blood in them also. They are, only a cadet branch, and you are close upon the main line; but still it, is not for us to deny the connection.\\\" She brought a cold sweat out upon, me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to Lord, Saltire and explaining our respective positions. Several times during, the evening I heard her murmur complacently that they were only the, cadet branch.\\n\\nCullingworth and his wife. They visit nobody, and nobody visits them. My, living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my, head, although I have never done anything unprofessional myself. Who, should I see in the street the other day but the McFarlanes, whom you, will remember at Linlithgow? I was foolish enough to propose to Maimie, McFarlane once, and she was sensible enough to refuse me. What I should, have done had she accepted me, I can't imagine; for that was three years, ago, and I have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then., Well, there's no use yearning for what you can't have, and there's no, other man living to whom I would speak about the matter at all; but life, is a deadly, lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself., Why is it that I am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you\\n\\nI was, as you may imagine, all in a tingle to know what it was that he, wanted with me. However, as he made no allusion to it, I did not care to, ask, and, during our longish walk, we talked about indifferent matters., It was football first, I remember, whether Richmond had a chance against, Blackheath, and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the, old scrimmages. Then he got on to inventions, and became so excited that, he had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all, his points home with his fist upon his palm. I can see him now stopping\\n\\nbut a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth. One, feels that the white upon the hair, like that upon the mountain, should, signify a height attained. I rose and bade him good-night, with a last, impression of him leaning back in his dressing-gown, a sodden cigar-end, in the corner of his mouth, his beard all slopped with whisky, and his, half-glazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr. I, had to go into the street and walk up and down for half-an-hour before I, felt clean enough to go to bed.\\n\\nAt three in the morning, I was awakened by a dreadful crash. Bounding, out of bed I rushed into the other room. Poor Fred was standing in his, long gown, a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning, day. He had pulled over his washing-stand (with what object only his, bemuddled mind could say), and the whole place was a morass of water, with islands of broken crockery. I picked him up and put him back into, his bed again--his body glowing through his night-dress, and his eyes, staring wildly about him. It was evidently impossible to leave him, and, so I spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair., No, it was certainly not a sinecure that I had undertaken.\\n\\nand saying that, poor as our family was, none of them had ever fallen so, low as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous, character and doubtful antecedents. I answered that Cullingworth spoke, sometimes of paying his creditors, that Mrs. Cullingworth was in favour, of it also, and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that I, should sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which I had, no connection. I assured her that if Cullingworth did anything from then, onwards which seemed to me dishonourable, I would disassociate myself, from him, and I mentioned that I had already refused to adopt some of, his professional methods. Well, in reply to this, my mother wrote a, pretty violent letter about what she thought of Cullingworth, which led, to another from me defending him, and showing that there were some deep, and noble traits in his character. That produced another still more, outspoken letter from her; and so the correspondence went on, she, attacking and I defending, until a serious breach seemed to be opening, between us. I refrained from writing at last, not out of ill temper, but, because I thought that if she were given time she would cool down, and, take, perhaps, a more reasonable view of the situation. My father, from, the short note which he sent me, seemed to think the whole business, absolutely irregular, and to refuse to believe my accounts of, Cullingworth's practice and receipts. This double opposition, from the, very people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the, whole affair, caused me to be less disappointed than I should otherwise, have been when it all came to an end. In fact, I was quite in the humour, to finish it myself when Fate did it for me.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said I, \\\"that that is rather further than I am prepared, to go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain, friction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well, that I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall, be happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take, over my duties.\\\"\\n\\nYou make a mistake, however, in assuming that those who think as I, do are such a miserable minority. The whole essence of our thought is, independence and individual judgment; so that we don't get welded into, single bodies as the churches do, and have no opportunity of testing our, own strength. There are, no doubt, all shades of opinion among us; but, if you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the, doctrines usually accepted, and think that sectarian churches tend, to evil rather than good, I fancy that the figures would be rather, surprising. When I read your letter, I made a list of all those men with, whom I ever had intimate talk upon such matters. I got seventeen names\\n\\nthey have the merit of being consoling; for if we could conscientiously, see that sin served a purpose, and a good one, it would take some of the, blackness out of life. It seems to me, then, that Nature, still working, on the lines of evolution, strengthens the race in two ways. The one is, by improving those who are morally strong, which is done by increased, knowledge and broadening religious views; the other, and hardly less, important, is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally, weak. This is accomplished by drink and immorality. These are really two, of the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of, the race. I picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the, garden of life and plucking up the weeds. Looked at in one's own day\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" he explained, \\\"there's no good my putting a forty pound suite, into a bed-room, and then having to chuck it all out of the window in, order to make room for a hundred-pound one. No sense in that, Munro!, Eh, what! I'm going to furnish this house as no house has ever been, furnished. By Crums! I'll bring the folk from a hundred miles round just, to have leave to look at it. But I must do it room by room. Come down, with me and look at the dining-room. You must be hungry after your, journey.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then I have seen something of the same sort in Cullingworth; but, he is so strange a being that I never attach much importance to his, variations. He glares at me like an angry bull occasionally; and then, when I ask him what is the matter, he growls out, \\\"Oh, nothing!\\\" and, turns on his heel. Then at other times he is so cordial and friendly, that he almost overdoes it, and I find myself wondering whether he is, not acting. It must seem ungracious to you that I should speak so of a, man who has been my benefactor; and it seems so to me also, but still, that IS the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes. It's an, absurd idea, too; for what possible object could his wife and he have, in pretending to be amiable, if they did not really feel so? And yet you, know the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not, with his eyes.\\n\\nnever returned. I fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited, their confidence. Others have become warm partisans. But they have, nearly all been very poor people; and when you consider how many one and, sixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which, I must find every quarter for rent, taxes, gas and water, you will, understand that even with some success, I have still found it a hard, matter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder., However, my boy, two quarters are paid up, and I enter upon a third one, with my courage unabated. I have lost about a stone, but not my heart.\\n\\nfrom boot-blacking to medicine-carrying. His one dissipation is cutting, out of paper, or buying in lead (on the rare occasion when we find a, surplus), an army of little soldiers. I have brought a patient into the, consulting room, and found a torrent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, pouring across the table. I have been myself attacked as I sat silently, writing, and have looked up to find fringes of sharp-shooters pushing, up towards me, columns of infantry in reserve, a troop of cavalry on my, flank, while a battery of pea muzzle-loaders on the ridge of my medical, dictionary has raked my whole position--with the round, smiling face of, the general behind it all. I don't know how many regiments he has on a, peace footing; but if serious trouble were to break out, I am convinced, that every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms.\\n\\nIn that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty, night. He was gaily dressed in the first place, check trousers, white, waistcoat, a flower in his button hole. But the look of the man was, very much to my heart. He was ruddy checked and black eyed, with a jolly, stout figure and an honest genial smile. I felt as we clinched hands in, the foggy grimy station that I had met a man and a friend.\\n\\nWell, then, it was night when we reached Avonmouth, and as I popped my, head out of the carriage window, the first thing that my eyes rested, upon was old Cullingworth, standing in, the circle of light under a, gas-lamp. His frock coat was flying open, his waistcoat unbuttoned at, the top, and his hat (a top hat this time) jammed on the back of his, head, with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it. In every way\\n\\nshortly after my start, telling me that he had heard of my proceedings, from my mother, and that he hoped to learn of my success. He is, as I, think you know, an ardent Wesleyan, like all my father's people, and he, told me that the chief Wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend, of his own, that he had learned from him that there was no Wesleyan, doctor, and that, being of a Wesleyan stock myself, if I would present, the enclosed letter of introduction to the minister, I should certainly, find it very much to my advantage. I thought it over, Bertie, and, it seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a, religious organisation to my own advantage, when I condemned them in the, abstract. It was a sore temptation, but I destroyed the letter.\\n\\nShe is a very well-read woman is the mother; she keeps up to date in, French literature as well as in English, and can talk by the hour about, the Goncourts, and Flaubert, and Gautier. Yet she is always hard at, work; and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery. She reads when, she knits, she reads when she scrubs, she even reads when she feeds, her babies. We have a little joke against her, that at an interesting, passage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little, sister's car-hole, the child having turned her head at the critical, instant. Her hands are worn with work, and yet where is the idle woman, who has read as much?\\n\\nHe was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves, then His, existence loses its point, since we and He start upon a different basis., To my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty, and the moral of His life. If He was divine then He COULD not sin, and, there was an end of the matter. We who are not divine and can sin, have, little to learn from a life like that.\\\"\\n\\nWell, this began to look more like business--especially that last, sentence. I took it to Horton, and asked his advice. His opinion was, that I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. So it ended by my, wiring back accepting the partnership--if it is a partnership--and, to-morrow morning I am off to Bradfield with great hopes and a small, portmanteau. I know how interested you are in the personality of, Cullingworth--as every one is who comes, even at second hand, within, range of his influence; and so you may rely upon it that I shall give, you a very full and particular account of all that passes between us. I, am looking forward immensely to seeing him again, and I trust we won't, have any rows.\\n\\nThis was getting too hot, Bertie. I saw all the folly of the thing. I, believed that I might whip him; but at the same time I knew that we were, so much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without, any possible object to serve. For all that, I took my gloves off, and I, think perhaps it was the wisest course after all. If Cullingworth, once thought he had the whiphand of you, you might be sorry for it, afterwards.\\n\\nPoor Whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony. He was staggering, under the weight of a fine Japanese cabinet which he had carried round, from his lodgings. I had asked him to come to the church, and the old, gentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie. Between, ourselves, I had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should, upset him, as in the case of the dinner; but nothing could be more, exemplary than his conduct and appearance. I had introduced him to, Winnie some days before.\\n\\n\\\"Pray step in,\\\" I answered, and waved him into the consulting-room. He, was a pompous, heavy-stepping, thick-voiced sort of person, but to me he, was an angel from on high. I was nervous, and at the same time so afraid, that he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me, that I, found myself drifting into an extravagant geniality. He seated himself, at my invitation and gave a husky cough.\\n\\nyou and I, and have done ever since I have known you. You are true, to your faith, I to my reason--you to your family belief, I to my own, ideas; but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man, and, his affinity for others, depends upon quite other things than views on, abstract questions. Anyway, I can say with all my heart that I wish I, saw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth, sitting, in that ricketty American-leather armchair, with the villanous, lodging-house antimacassar over the back of it. It is good of you to, tell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures; though if I, had not KNOWN that you were so, you may be sure that I should never have, ventured to inflict any of them upon you. My future is now all involved, in obscurity, but it is obvious that the first thing I must do is to, find a fitting house, and my second to cajole the landlord into letting, me enter into possession of it without any prepayment. To that I will, turn myself to-morrow morning, and you shall know the result. Whom, should I hear from the other day but Archie McLagan? Of course it was a, begging letter. You can judge how far I am in a state to lose money; but, in a hot fit I sent him ten shillings, which now, in my cold, I bitterly, regret. With every good wish to you and yours, including your town, your, State, and your great country, yours as ever.\\n\\nI am sure, a most extraordinary figure. Indeed, she looked rather funny, herself, with her palette in one hand, her brush in the other, and the, blank astonishment on her face. I stammered out something about hoping, that she did not mind, which made her more angry than ever. \\\"The, only possible excuse for your conduct, sir, is that you are under the, influence of drink,\\\" said she. \\\"I need not say that we do not require, the services of a medical man in that condition.\\\" I did not try to, disabuse her of the idea, for really I could see no better explanation;, so I beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition. She wrote a letter, to my father about it in the evening, and the old man was very angry, indeed. As to the mother, she is as staunch as steel, and quite prepared, to prove that poor Mrs. A. was a very deep designing person, who had, laid a trap for innocent Johnnie. So there has been a grand row; and not, a soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means, except only, yourself as you read this letter.\\n\\nThen down a winding wooden stair to the basement, where were kitchen, and scullery, dimly lit, and asphalt-floored. As I entered the latter I, stood staring. In every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me., The place was a Golgotha! In that half light the effect was sepulchral., But as I approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished., They were of plaster-of-Paris, and were the leavings evidently of the, dentist, who had been the last tenant. A more welcome sight was a huge, wooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner. It only, wanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room.\\n\\n, The letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so, connected a whole, and to give so plain an account of some of the, troubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the, outset of his career, that I have handed them over to the gentleman who, is about to edit them. There are two of them, the fifth and the ninth\\n\\nand it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing--but then, would come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my, ledger. Where did it come from you will ask. Some from old Whitehall and, his circle of Bohemians. Some from accident cases. Some from new comers, to the town who drifted to me. Some from people whom I met first in, other capacities. An insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to, examine, and that was a very great help. Above all, I learned a fact, which I would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts, as I, have done, a stranger among strangers. Do not think that practice will, come to you. You must go to it. You may sit upon your consulting room, chair until it breaks under you, but without purchase or partnership you, will make little or no progress. The way to do it is to go out, to mix, everywhere with men, to let them know you. You will come back many a, time and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for, you in your absence. Never mind! Go out again. A noisy smoking concert, where you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two, whom you might have seen at home. It took me some time to realise, but I, speak now as one who knows.\\n\\nWait a bit, though! One did. I was awakened at six in the morning one, day by a ringing at my bell, and creeping to the angle of the stair, I saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a top-hat outside. Much, excited, with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head, I ran, back, pulled on some clothes, rushed down, opened the door, and found, myself in the grey morning light face to face with Horton. The good, fellow had come down from Merton in an excursion train, and had been, travelling all night. He had an umbrella under his arm, and two great, straw baskets in each hand, which contained, when unpacked, a cold leg, of mutton, half-a-dozen of beer, a bottle of port, and all sorts of, pasties and luxuries. We had a great day together, and when he rejoined, his excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he, had found.\\n\\neven when we know each other as well as I know you. Why should we, when, that which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of, advance from friendship to intimacy, and from intimacy to something, more sacred still, which can scarcely be written at all, far less made, interesting to another? The time came at last when they were to leave, Birchespool, and my mother and I went round the night before to say, goodbye. Winnie and I were thrown together for an instant.\\n\\nsomebody will be hanged. Questions about this--questions about that. At, last they asked me what I proposed to fasten my magnet to. I answered, to any solid impenetrable object, such as the head of an Admiralty, official. Well, that broke the whole thing up. They wrote with their, compliments, and they were returning my apparatus. I wrote with my, compliments, and they might go to the devil. And so ends a great, historical incident, Munro--eh, what?\\\"\\n\\nBut the thing that took the fun out of him, and made him gnash his, teeth, and stride cursing about the room, was to see a patient walking, up the steps which led to the door of Scarsdale, his opposite neighbour., Scarsdale had a fairly busy practice, and received his people at home, from ten to twelve, so that I got quite used to seeing Cullingworth fly, out of his chair, and rush raving to the window. He would diagnose, the cases, too, and estimate their money value until he was hardly, articulate.\\n\\nquiet-voiced and gentle-mannered. You had only to see the way in which, she looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his, control, and that do what he might, or say what he might, it would, always be the best thing to her. She could be obstinate, too, in a, gentle, dove-like sort of way; but her obstinacy lay always in the, direction of backing up his sayings and doings. This, however, I was, only to find out afterwards; and at that, my first visit, she impressed, me as being one of the sweetest little women that I had ever known.\\n\\nand I felt much more cheery by the time I had finished my letter. I was, just addressing the envelope (observe what a continuous narrative you, get of my proceedings!) when I was set jumping out of my carpet slippers, by a ring at the bell. Through the glass panel I observed that it was a, respectable-looking bearded individual with a top-hat. It was a patient., It MUST be a patient! Then first I realised what an entirely different, thing it is to treat the patient of another man (as I had done with, Horton) or to work a branch of another man's practice (as I had done, with Cullingworth), and to have to do with a complete stranger on your, own account. I had been thrilling to have one. Now that he had come I, felt for an instant as if I would not open the door. But of course that, was only a momentary weakness. I answered his ring with, I fear, rather, a hypocritical air of insouciance, as though I had happened to find, myself in the hall, and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the, stairs.\\n\\nNext morning I came round to my house--MY house, my boy!--for good, and all, after paying off my landlady. Her bill came to more than I, expected, for I only had breakfast and tea, always \\\"dining out\\\" as I, majestically expressed it. However, it was a relief to me to get it, settled, and to go round with my box to Oakley Villas. An ironmonger had, fixed my plate on to the railings for half-a-crown the evening before\\n\\nWell, it was nearly six o'clock, and evening was just creeping in when, we drew up in Bradfield Station. The first thing I saw when I looked out, of the window was Cullingworth, exactly the same as ever, striding in, his jerky way down the platform, his coat flying open, his chin thrust, forward (he is the most under-hung man I have ever seen), and his great, teeth all gleaming, like a good-natured blood-hound. He roared with, delight when he saw me, wrung my hand, and slapped me enthusiastically, upon the shoulder.\\n\\nAnd certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin, laying down laws about the future; for how do we know that there are not, phases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception?, After all, a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average, life is of the period during which we know that the world has been in, existence. But if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight, his, son the same, and his son the same, what would their united experiences, after a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call, night? So all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth, is not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception.\\n\\n\\\"There are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of, handling patients,\\\" he remarked, seating himself on the table and, swinging his legs. \\\"The most obvious is that you must never let them see, that you want them. It should be pure condescension on your part seeing, them at all; and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it, the, more they think of it. Break your patients in early, and keep them well, to heel. Never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many, foolish young men fall into this habit, and are ruined in consequence., Now, this is my form\\\"--he sprang to the door, and putting his two hands, to his mouth he bellowed: \\\"Stop your confounded jabbering down there! I, might as well be living above a poultry show! There, you see,\\\" he added, to me, \\\"they will think ever so much more of me for that.\\\"\\n\\nand skims plates out of the window at the passers-by. Of course, it is, really not funny, but pathetic and deplorable--all the same, it is hard, to keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and, her appearance. I was called in by accident in the first instance; but I, speedily acquired some control over her, so that now the neighbours send, for me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window. She, has a fair competence, so that her little vagaries are a help to me with, my rent. She has, too, a number of curious jugs, statues, and pictures\\n\\nWell, I know that I am a shocking bad story-teller, but I just try to, get things as near the truth as I can manage it. If I only knew how to, colour it up, I could make some of this better reading. I can get along, when I am on one line, but it is when I have to bring in a second line, of events that I understand what C. means when he says that I will never, be able to keep myself in nibs by what I earn in literature.\\n\\nOnce he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge, shop, a place that had been a raper's, with a counter about sixty feet, long. His reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a, little further down on the other side. Poor old \\\"armed transport\\\" worked, so hard that I could not help being touched and grateful; yet I longed, from my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent\\n\\n, Birchespool is really a delightful place, dear Bertie; and I ought to, know something about it, seeing that I have padded a good hundred miles, through its streets during the last seven days. Its mineral springs used, to be quite the mode a century or more ago; and it retains many traces, of its aristocratic past, carrying it with a certain grace, too, as an, emigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled, in Versailles. I forget the new roaring suburbs with their out-going, manufactures and their incoming wealth, and I live in the queer, health-giving old city of the past. The wave of fashion has long passed, over it, but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind., In the High Street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the, railings where the link-boys used to put out their torches, instead of, stamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement, as was the custom, in less high-toned quarters. There are the very high curbstones too\\n\\n\\\"But what is mother to do?\\\" cried the girl, taking up the tale again., \\\"No hotel or lodging-house would take us in while poor Fred is like, that. And we have not the heart to send him to an asylum. Uncle will not, have us any longer, and we have nowhere to go to.\\\" Her grey eyes tried, to look brave, but her mouth would go down at the corners.\\n\\nis either extinct or on the way towards it. Struma, tubercle, nervous, disease, have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten, branch, and the average of the race is thereby improved. I believe from, the little that I have seen of life, that it is a law which acts with, startling swiftness, that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate, their species at all, and that when the curse is hereditary, the second, generation generally sees the end of it.\\n\\n\\\"We must do what we can to make up. Now, I tell you what I am prepared, to do. I was talking about it with Hetty this morning, and she thought, as I did. If we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your, legs under you, it would encourage you to start for yourself, and you, could pay it back as soon as you were able.\\\"\\n\\nIf Cullingworth still bore any resentment, he concealed it most, admirably. But then I knew by experience that that genial loud-voiced, John-Bull manner of his COULD conceal many things. His wife was more, open; and I could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes, that, she at least stood fast to the old quarrel. Cullingworth was little, changed, and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we'll see about that when they do. Meanwhile I am paying ready, money for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps. They think so, well of me here that I could have had the whole place furnished like a, palace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff, only I determined to take, each room in turn when I was ready for it. There's nearly four hundred, pounds under this one ceiling.\\\"\\n\\nStill I must confess that there is nothing about Cullingworth which jars, me so much as the low view which he takes of our profession. I can never, reconcile myself to his ideas, and yet I can never convert him to mine;, so there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide, us altogether. He will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the, question. A profession, in his view, is a means of earning a livelihood\\n\\n\\\"Very good. You are also aware, I presume, that modern projectiles are, either made of or tipped with steel. It may possibly have come to your, ears that magnets attract steel. Permit me now to show you a small, experiment.\\\" He bent over his apparatus, and I suddenly heard the, snapping of electricity. \\\"This,\\\" he continued going across to the, packing case, \\\"is a saloon pistol, and will be exhibited in the museums, of the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was, inaugurated. Into the breech I place a Boxer cartridge, specialty, provided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet. I aim point, blank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall, which is four inches, above the magnet. I am an absolutely dead shot. I fire. You will now, advance, and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end, of the magnet, after which you will apologise to me for that grin.\\\"\\n\\nHeigh ho! it's nearly dawn, and I as wakeful as ever. It is chilly, and, I have draped a blanket round me. I've heard that this is the favourite, hour of the suicide, and I see that I've been tailing off in the, direction of melancholy myself. Let me wind up on a lighter chord by, quoting Cullingworth's latest article. I must tell you that he is, still inflamed by the idea of his own paper, and his brain is in full, eruption, sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs\\n\\nwe are too apt to overlook the ninety-nine decent folk by their own, firesides. I shall not make that mistake any more. The kindliness of the, poor to the poor makes a man sick of himself. And their sweet patience!, Depend upon it, if ever there is a popular rising, the wrongs which lead, to it must be monstrous and indefensible. I think the excesses of the, French Revolution are dreadful enough in themselves, but much more so as, an index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad, protest. And then the wisdom of the poor! It is amusing to read the glib, newspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses. They don't, know the date of Magna Charta, or whom John of Gaunt married; but put, a practical up-to-date problem before them, and see how unerringly they, take the right side. Didn't they put the Reform Bill through in the, teeth of the opposition of the majority of the so-called educated, classes? Didn't they back the North against the South when nearly all, our leaders went wrong? When universal arbitration and the suppression, of the liquor traffic comes, is it not sure to be from the pressure of, these humble folks? They look at life with clearer and more unselfish, eyes. It's an axiom, I think, that to heighten a nation's wisdom you, must lower its franchise.\\n\\nWhen I woke next morning he was in my room, and a funny-looking object, he was. His dressing-gown lay on a chair, and he was putting up a, fifty-six pound dumb-bell, without a rag to cover him. Nature didn't, give him a very symmetrical face, nor the sweetest of expressions; but, he has a figure like a Greek statue. I was amused to see that both his, eyes had a touch of shadow to them. It was his turn to grin when I, sat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a, toadstool. However, he was all for peace that morning, and chatted away, in the most amiable manner possible.\\n\\nand began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the, three hundred spectators. It was fine to see the deliberate way in which, he picked his way among the ink bottles. As he sprang down from the last, bench on to the floor, his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in, the face. Cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him, however, and rushed, him backwards out of the class-room. What he did with him I don't know\\n\\nI was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this, rigmarole. When he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box, and, we could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair. I, was still looking at the medal, which, from the dents all over it, had, evidently been often used as a target, when I felt a timid touch upon my, sleeve; it was Mrs. Cullingworth, who was looking earnestly at me with a, very distressed expression upon her face.\\n\\nfor you could never tell what it might lead to. His temper was nothing, less than infernal. I have seen him in the dissecting-rooms begin to, skylark with a fellow, and then in an instant the fun would go out of, his face, his little eyes would gleam with fury, and the two would be, rolling, worrying each other like dogs, below the table. He would, be dragged off, panting and speechless with fury, with his wiry hair, bristling straight up like a fighting terrier's.\\n\\nwhich was as welcome to me, and as much of a windfall, as the Spanish, wreck to Robinson Crusoe. There were too pairs of thick blankets, two, sheets, a counterpane, a pillow, a camp-stool, two stuffed bears' paws, (of all things in this world!), two terra-cotta vases, a tea-cosy, two, pictures in frames, several books, an ornamental ink-pot, and a number, of antimacassars and coloured tablecloths. It is not until you own a, table with a deal top and mahogany legs, that you understand what the, true inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is. Right on the top of this, treasure came a huge hamper from the Apothecaries' Society with the, drugs which I had ordered. When they were laid out in line, the bottles, extended right down one side of the dining-room and half down the other., As I walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions, I, felt less radical in my views, and begun to think that there might be, something in the rights of property after all.\\n\\nas they do in the mediaeval churches, he might, I am sure, paper, his consulting room with them. A favourite device of his with an, impressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure. \\\"My, dear,\\\" he will say, swaying some girl about by the shoulders, with his, nose about three inches from hers, \\\"you'll feel better to-morrow at a, quarter to ten, and at twenty past you'll be as well as ever you were in, your life. Now, keep your eye on the clock, and see if I am not right.\\\", Next day, as likely as not, her mother will be in, weeping tears of, joy; and another miracle has been added to Cullingworth's record. It may, smell of quackery, but it is exceedingly useful to the patient.\\n\\nIn the meantime I had enlisted a most unexpected ally. On the second, evening a card was solemnly brought up by the landlady's daughter from, the lodger who occupied the room below. On it was inscribed \\\"Captain, Whitehall\\\"; and then underneath, in brackets, \\\"Armed Transport.\\\" On, the back of the card was written, \\\"Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), presents his compliments to Dr. Munro, and would be glad of his, company to supper at 8.30.\\\" To this I answered, \\\"Dr. Munro presents his, compliments to Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), and will be most, happy to accept his kind invitation.\\\" What \\\"Armed Transport\\\" might mean, I had not an idea, but I thought it well to include it, as he seemed so, particular about it himself.\\n\\nFirst of all, about the practice. I told you that I was to have a room, immediately opposite to Cullingworth's, and that all the surgical cases, were to be turned over to me. For a few days I had nothing to do, except, to listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients, or making, speeches to them from the top of the stairs. However, a great \\\"Dr. Stark, Munro, Surgeon,\\\" has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs\\n\\nTalking of cheeriness, you misunderstand me, Bertie, if you think (as, you seem to imply) that I take a dark view of things. It is true that I, discard some consolations which you possess, because I cannot convince, myself that they are genuine; but in this world, at least, I see immense, reason for hope, and as to the next I am confident that all will be for, the best. From annihilation to beatification I am ready to adapt myself, to whatever the great Designer's secret plan my be.\\n\\nSo the Cullingworths did their bag-procession through the doctors', quarter alone to-day, and I walked to the park, where I sat down on one, of the seats, lit a cigar, and thought the whole matter over. I was down, on my luck at first; but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the, budding flowers soon set me right again. I began my last letter among, the stars, and I am inclined to finish this one among the flowers, for, they are rare companions when one's mind is troubled. Most things on, this earth, from a woman's beauty to the taste of a nectarine, seem to, be the various baits with which Nature lures her silly gudgeons. They, shall eat, they shall propagate, and for the sake of pleasing themselves, they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them. But, there lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower. It's charm, has no ulterior motive.\\n\\nAnd this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair., Cullingworth, who had drunk off a couple of glasses, waited until his, wife had left the room, and then began to talk of the difficulty of, getting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of, patients. This led us round to the ways in which a man might take his, exercise indoors, and that to boxing. Cullingworth took a couple of, pairs of gloves out of a cupboard, and proposed that we should fight a, round or two then and there.\\n\\nNow, first of all, I want to tell you about how the practice has been, going on. The week after I wrote last showed a slight relapse. I only, took two pounds. But on the next I took a sudden jump up to three pounds, seven shillings, and this last week I took three pounds ten. So it was, steadily creeping up; and I really thought that I saw my road clear, in front of me, when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue. There were, reasons, however, which prevented my being very disappointed when it did, come down; and these I must make clear to you.\\n\\nWell, with half-an-hour for lunch, this extraordinary business went, on till a quarter to four in the afternoon. When the last patient had, departed, Cullingworth led the way into the dispensary, where all the, fees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value., There were seventeen half-sovereigns, seventy-three shillings, and, forty-six florins; or thirty-two pounds eight and sixpence in all., Cullingworth counted it up, and then mixing the gold and silver into, one heap, he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it., Finally, he raked it into the canvas bag which I had seen the night, before, and lashed the neck up with a boot-lace.\\n\\nWell, she had heard some details about the Cullingworths which, displeased her when I first knew them. Then came the smash-up at, Avonmouth, and my mother liked them less and less. She was averse to my, joining them in Bradfield, and it was only by my sudden movement at the, end that I escaped a regular prohibition. When I got there, the very, first question she asked (when I told her of their prosperity) was, whether they had paid their Avonmouth creditors. I was compelled to, answer that they had not. In reply she wrote imploring me to come away\\n\\nHis wisdom, His forethought for small wants, His providing of luxuries, for His creatures. On the other hand, do not let us be disingenuous, enough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain, in cruelty, in all which, seems to be a slur upon His work. The best that we can say for them is, to hope that they are not as bad as they seem, and possibly lead to some, higher end. The voices of the ill-used child and of the tortured animal, are the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer.\\n\\nwhen the main trunk is rotten beneath them, and both must in their, present forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin. The movement, of human thought, though slow, is still in the direction of truth, and, the various religions which man sheds as he advances (each admirable in, its day) will serve, like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel, to, give the rate and direction of his progress.\\n\\nAnd now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole, life. Whom do you think I had a letter from last Tuesday week? From, Cullingworth, no less. It had no beginning, no end, was addressed, all wrong, and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a, prescription. How it ever reached me is a wonder. This is what he had to, say:--\\n\\nseemed to fall away, and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable, Guide of the Universe were for an instant face to face. I was on my, knees--hurled down all against my own will, as it were. And even then, I could find no words to say. Only vague yearnings and emotions and a, heartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good. What could, I say? Every prayer seemed based on the idea that God was a magnified, man--that He needed asking and praising and thanking. Should the cog of, the wheel creak praise to the Engineer? Let it rather cog harder, and, creak less. Yet I did, I confess, try to put the agitation of my soul, into words. I meant it for a prayer; but when I considered afterwards, the \\\"supposing thats\\\" and \\\"in case ofs\\\" with which it was sprinkled, it, must have been more like a legal document. And yet I felt soothed and, happier as I went downstairs again.\\n\\nI have often wondered why some of those writing fellows don't try their, hands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of, puberty until he begins to find his feet a little. Men are very fond, of analysing the feelings of their heroines, which they cannot possibly, know anything about, while they have little to say of the inner, development of their heroes, which is an experience which they have, themselves undergone. I should like to try it myself, but it would need, blending with fiction, and I never had a spark of imagination. But I, have a vivid recollection of what I went through myself. At the time I, thought (as everybody thinks) that it was a unique experience; but since, I have heard the confidences of my father's patients I am convinced that, it is the common lot. The shrinking, horrible shyness, alternating with, occasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against, it, the longing for close friendship, the agonies over imaginary, slights, the extraordinary sexual doubts, the deadly fears caused by, non-existent diseases, the vague emotion produced by all women, and the, half-frightened thrill by particular ones, the aggressiveness caused, by fear of being afraid, the sudden blacknesses, the profound, self-distrust--I dare bet that you have felt every one of them, Bertie\\n\\nis pronounced by Dr. Stark Munro, of Oakley Villa, to have suffered no, serious injury.\\\" As Cullingworth used to say, it is hard enough for the, young doctor to push his name into any publicity, and he must take what, little chances he has. Perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake, their heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal; but, I was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing, their own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in The, Times.\\n\\nYou'll see from the address of this letter, Bertie, that I have left, Scotland and am in Yorkshire. I have been here three months, and am now, on the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the, queerest prospects. Good old Cullingworth has turned out a trump, as I, always knew he would. But, as usual, I am beginning at the wrong end, so, here goes to give you an idea of what has been happening.\\n\\nWhat should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture, submitted to him, and who, having satisfied himself that the account, given of the painting of the picture is incorrect, at once concludes, that no one ever painted it, or at least asserts that he has no possible, means of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not? That is, as, it seems to me, a fair statement of the position of some of the more, extreme agnostics. \\\"Is not the mere existence of the picture in itself, a proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it? one might ask.\\\", \\\"Why, no,\\\" says the objector. \\\"It is possible that the picture produced, itself by the aid of certain rules. Besides, when the picture was first, submitted to me I was assured that it had all been produced within a, week, but by examining it I am able to say with certainty that it has, taken a considerable time to put together. I am therefore of opinion, that it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all.\\\"\\n\\nSo ends the history of a failure. I am, as you know, inclined to, fatalism, and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists; so I am, bound to think that this experience was given to me for some end. It, was a preliminary canter for the big race, perhaps. My mother was, disappointed, but tried to show it as little as possible. My father, was a little sardonic over the matter. I fear that the gap between us, widens. By the way, an extraordinary card arrived from Cullingworth, during my absence. \\\"You are my man,\\\" said he; \\\"mind that I am to have, you when I want you.\\\" There was no date and no address, but the postmark, was Bradfield in the north of England. Does it mean nothing? Or may it, mean everything? We must wait and see.\\n\\n, Well, the second person whom I admitted through my door was the High, Church curate of the parish--at least, I deduced High Church from his, collar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain. He seemed to be, a fine upstanding manly fellow--in fact, I am bound in honesty to admit, that I have never met the washy tea-party curate outside the pages of, Punch. As a body, I think they would compare very well in manliness (I, do not say in brains) with as many young lawyers or doctors. Still, I, have no love for the cloth. Just as cotton, which is in itself the most, harmless substance in the world, becomes dangerous on being dipped into, nitric acid, so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once, soaked in sectarian religion. If he has any rancour or hardness in him, it will bring it out. I was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my, visitor, though I trust that I received him with fitting courtesy. The, quick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my, consulting-room, told me that it was not quite what he had expected.\\n\\nMy red drugget I laid out in the centre, and fastened it down with, brass-headed nails. It looked much smaller than I had hoped,--a little, red island on an ocean of deal board, or a postage stamp in the middle, of an envelope. In the centre of it I placed my table, with three, medical works on one side of it, and my stethoscope and dresser's case, upon the other. One chair went with the table, of course; and then I, spent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other, two looked better together--a dense block of chairs, as it were--or, scattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous, chairs. I placed them finally one on the right, and one in front of, the table. Then I put down my fender, and nailed \\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo, Players,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle\\\" on to three of the walls, with the mental, promise that my first spare half-crown should buy a picture for the, fourth. In the window I placed my little square table, and balanced upon, it a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which I, had brought in my trunk. Finally, I found a pair of dark brown curtains, among the job lot which I had bought at the sale, and these I put up and, drew pretty close together, so that a subdued light came into the room\\n\\nwith the bustle of green tree tops. It was a windy day, and the clouds, were drifting swiftly across the heavens, with glimpses of blue between., I don't know how it was, but as I stood looking through the grimy panes, in the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my, responsibility to some higher power came upon me, with a vividness which, was overpowering. Here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened., What was to be the end of it? I had strength, I had gifts. What was I, going to do with them? All the world, the street, the cabs, the houses\\n\\nYou'll wonder what has taken me off on this line. Only that I seem, to see it all in action in my own life. But, as usual, I have started, merrily off with an appendix, so I shall go back and begin my report, as nearly as possible where I ended the last. First of all, I may, say generally that the clouds were thinning then, and that they broke, shortly afterwards. During the last few months we have never once quite, lost sight of the sun.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, curse the politics! Red pepper well rubbed in, that's my idea of a, paper. Call it the Scorpion. Chaff the Mayor and the Council until they, call a meeting and hang themselves. I'd do the snappy paragraphs, and, you would do the fiction and poetry. I thought about it during the, night, and Hetty has written to Murdoch's to get an estimate for the, printing. We might get our first number out this day week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you've got your armour there, laddie, it will be pierced,\\\" says he., \\\"Put up forty feet thick of steel; and I'll build a gun that will knock, it into tooth-powder. It would blow away, and set the folk coughing, after I had one shot at it. But you can't pierce armour which only drops, after the shot has passed through. What's the good of it? Why it, keeps out the water. That's the main thing, after all. I call it the, Cullingworth spring-shutter screen. Eh, what, Munro? I wouldn't take, a quarter of a million for the idea. You see how it would work. Spring, shutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks, used to be. They are in sections, three feet broad, we will say, and, capable when let down of reaching the keel. Very well! Enemy sends a, shot through Section A of the side. Section A shutter is lowered. Only, a thin film, you see, but enough to form a temporary plug. Enemy's ram, knocks in sections B, C, D of the side. What do you do? Founder? Not, a bit; you lower sections B, C, and D of Cullingworth's spring-shutter, screen. Or you knock a hole on a rock. The same thing again. It's a, ludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution, would absolutely save her. And it's equally good for ironclads also. A, shot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them., Down go your shutters, and all is well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I could. Such a novel, Munro, that when they'd read the first, chapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out., They'd wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was, coming next. By Crums, I'll go and begin it now!\\\" And, with another, somersault over the end of the bed, he rushed from the room, with the, tassels of his dressing gown flying behind him.\\n\\nhis guards, and his cellars of wine in a more logical position. They are, all good and talented men, and in the market of brains are worth perhaps, as much as they get. But how can they bring themselves to pose as the, representatives of a creed, which, as they themselves expound it, is, based upon humility, poverty, and self-denial? Not one of them who, would not quote with approval the parable of the Wedding Guest. But, try putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next Court, reception. It happened some little time ago with a Cardinal, and England, rang with his protests. How blind not to see how they would spring at, one leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim, the last as the special badge of their master!\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said I, \\\"that's easily set right.\\\" I marched out of the room and, downstairs, with both Cullingworth and his wife behind me. Into the yard, I went, and, picking up a big hammer, I started for the front door, with, the pair still at my heels. I got the forked end of the hammer under my, plate, and with a good wrench I brought the whole thing clattering on to, the pavement.\\n\\nBut if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its, honey bag and its collecting forceps, and for the lowly seed so as to, have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil, then is it, conceivable that we, the highest product of all, are overlooked? It is, NOT conceivable. The idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as, we see it. I say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty, of a most watchful Providence.\\n\\nI'll give you an idea of what a day's work is like. We breakfast about, nine o'clock, and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to, drop in. Many of them are very poor people, belonging to the colliery, clubs, the principle of which is, that the members pay a little over a, halfpenny a week all the year round, well or ill, in return for which, they get medicine and attendance free. \\\"Not much of a catch for the, doctors,\\\" you would say, but it is astonishing what competition there, is among them to get the appointment. You see it is a certainty for, one thing, and it leads indirectly to other little extras. Besides, it, amounts up surprisingly. I have no doubt that Horton has five or six, hundred a year from his clubs alone. On the other hand, you can imagine, that club patients, since they pay the same in any case, don't let their, ailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room.\\n\\nCullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper. He has carried, the matter through with his usual energy, but he doesn't know enough, about local affairs to be able to write about them, and it is a question, whether he can interest the people here in anything else. At present we, are prepared to run the paper single-handed; we are working seven hours, a day at the practice; we are building a stable; and in our odd hours we, are practising at our magnetic ship-protector, with which Cullingworth, is still well pleased, though he wants to get it more perfect before, submitting it to the Admiralty.\\n\\nWas it not fine? It stirred my blood, and the words rang like a bugle, call in my head. It braced me, and the time was coming when all the, bracing I could get would not be too much. I copied it out, and pinned, it on one side of my mantel-piece. On the other I stuck up a chip from, Carlyle, which I daresay is as familiar to you as to me. \\\"One way or, another all the light, energy, and available virtue which we have does, come out of us, and goes very infallibly into God's treasury, living and, working through eternities there. We are not lost--not a single atom, of us--of one of us.\\\" Now, there is a religious sentence which is, intellectually satisfying, and therefore morally sound.\\n\\nWell, I really never intended to inflict all this upon you, Bertie. I, thought I could have made my position clear in a page or so. But you can, see how one point has brought up another. Even now I am leaving so much, unsaid. I can see with such certainty exactly what you will say. \\\"If, you deduce a good Providence from the good things in nature, what do, you make of the evil?\\\" That's what you will say. Suffice it that I am, inclined to deny the existence of evil. Not another word will I say upon, the subject; but if you come back to it yourself, then be it on your own, head.\\n\\nTo some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them, to say one. With a loud \\\"hush\\\" he would rush at them, thump them on the, chests, listen to their hearts, write their labels, and then run them, out of the room by their shoulders. One poor old lady he greeted with a, perfect scream. \\\"You've been drinking too much tea!\\\" he cried. \\\"You are, suffering from tea poisoning!\\\" Then, without allowing her to get a word, in, he clutched her by her crackling black mantle, dragged her up to the, table, and held out a copy of \\\"Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence\\\" which was, lying there. \\\"Put your hand on the book,\\\" he thundered, \\\"and swear that, for fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa.\\\" She swore with, upturned eyes, and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand\\n\\nIs he not a conundrum? If he interests you at a distance (and I take, for granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional, compliment) you can think how piquant he is in actual life. I must, confess, however, that I can never shake off the feeling that I am, living with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may, possibly bite. Well, it won't be very long before I write again, and, by that time I shall probably know whether I am likely to find, any permanent billet here or not. I am so sorry to hear about Mrs., Swanborough's indisposition. You know that I take the deepest interest, in everything that affects you. They tell me here that I am looking very, fit, though I think they ought to spell it with an \\\"a.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you, Bertie, the tears started to my eyes, and I could hardly, gulp out a word or two of thanks. What a crisscross of qualities in, one human soul! It was not the deed or the words; but it was the almost, womanly look in the eyes of this broken, drink-sodden old Bohemian--the, sympathy and the craving for sympathy which I read there. Only for an, instant though, for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half, defiant manner.\\n\\nwho leaned upon his Martini, with two little white kittens peeping over, either shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack. I was so moved at the, sight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old, country, that I sprang up on my box, took off my hat, and gave them, three cheers. At first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine, fashion--like a row of cows over a wall. At the second a good many, joined, and at the third my own voice was entirely lost. So I turned to, go my way, and the soldier laddies to go theirs; and I wondered which of, us had the stiffest and longest fight before us.\\n\\nDreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind, but I thought, of her nose and was reassured. An examination revealed everything. She, was a married woman. The lines were solemnly produced. Her husband was a, seaman. She had passed as a miss, because she thought I was more likely, to take a housekeeper without encumbrances. Her husband had come home, unexpectedly from a long voyage, and had returned last night. And, then--plot within plot--the other woman was not her sister, but a, friend, whose name was Miss Williams. She thought I was more likely to, take two sisters than two friends. So we all came to know who the other, was; and I, having given Jack permission to remain, assigned the other, top room to Miss Williams. From absolute solitude I seemed to be rapidly, developing into the keeper of a casual ward.\\n\\nhowever, part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact, that whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort, his exact, opposite at once springs up to neutralise him. You have a Mameluke: up, jumps a Crusader. You have a Fenian: up jumps an Orangeman. Every force, has its recoil. And so these more hide-bound scientists must be set, against those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in, the year 4004 B. C.\\n\\nI had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me, into the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as, to our financial position. He began the interview by unbuttoning his, waistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space, two, inches from the left sternal line. I did so, and was shocked to hear a, well-marked mitral regurgitant murmur.\\n\\nIf I hadn't been a fool, Bertie, I should never have consented. It's, one of my many weaknesses, that, whether it's a woman or a man, anything, like a challenge sets me off. But I knew Cullingworth's ways, and I told, you in my last what a lamb of a temper he has. None the less, we pushed, back the table, put the lamp on a high bracket, and stood up to one, another.\\n\\nfor it was merely a prospecting expedition, and I intended to return for, my luggage if I saw reason for hope. Alas! there was not the faintest., The sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that, ever lived. It is one of those picturesque little English towns with, a history and little else. A Roman trench and a Norman keep are its, principal products. But to me the most amazing thing about it was the, cloud of doctors which had settled upon it. A double row of brass plates, flanked the principal street. Where their patients came from I could not, imagine, unless they practised upon each other. The host of the \\\"Bull\\\", where I had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by, saying that, as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly, twelve miles in every direction, it was in these scattered farm-houses, that the Stockwell doctors found their patients. As I chatted with him a, middle-aged, dusty-booted man trudged up the street. \\\"There's Dr. Adam,\\\", said he. \\\"He's only a new-comer, but they say that some o' these days, he'll be starting his carriage.\\\" \\\"What do you mean by a new-comer?\\\", I asked. \\\"Oh, he's scarcely been here ten years,\\\" said the landlord., \\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"Can you tell me when the next train leaves for, Bradfield?\\\" So back I came, rather heavy at heart, and having spent, ten or twelve shillings which I could ill afford. My fruitless journey, seemed a small thing, however, when I thought of the rising Stockwellite, with his ten years and his dusty boots. I can trudge along a path\\n\\nand, as we are all very fond of the kind old lady, we were trying to, keep things as quiet as possible down-stairs. Suddenly there came, a bang! bang! bang! at the knocker; and then in an instant another, rattling series of knocks, as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick, in the panel. After all our efforts for silence it was exasperating. I, rushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand, to commence a fresh bombardment. \\\"What on earth's the matter?\\\" I asked\\n\\nBut there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man's heart, singing. Good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle., The race is improving. There are far fewer criminal convictions. There, is far more education. People sin less and think more. When I meet a, brutal looking fellow I often think that he and his type may soon be, as extinct as the great auk. I am not sure that in the interest of the, 'ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of Bill Sykes, to show, our children's children what sort of a person he was.\\n\\nI cannot be bigoted, my dear boy, when I say from the bottom of my heart, that I respect every good Catholic and every good Protestant, and that, I recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful, instrument in the hands of that inscrutable Providence which rules, all things. Just as in the course of history one finds that the most, far-reaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime; so in, religion, although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate, conception of the Creator and His ways, it may none the less be the very, best practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it. But, if it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to, adopt it, it is equally so for those to whom it is not, to protest, against it, until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets, gradually leavened, and pushed a little further upon their slow upward, journey.\\n\\nHowever, the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my, attention and breaking the blow which I had had in the Cullingworth, letter. It made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should, prove to be a patient, and the apparent patient an outsider. So back, I went, in a much more judicial frame of mind, to read that precious, document over again, and to make up my mind what it was that I should, do.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I had news of Cullingworth from Smeaton, who was in the, same football team at college, and who had called when he was passing, through Bradfield. His report was not a very favourable one. The, practice had declined considerably. People had no doubt accustomed, themselves to his eccentricities, and these had ceased to impress them., Again, there had been one or two coroner's inquests, which had spread, the impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs. If, the coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which Cullingworth had, effected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with, his censures. But, as you can understand, C.'s rival medical men, were not disposed to cover him in any way. He had never had much, consideration for them.\\n\\nWell, I examined him, and I found his own account not very far from the, truth. I went over him carefully from head to foot, and there was not, much left as Nature made it. He had mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of, the liver, Bright's disease, an enlarged spleen, and incipient dropsy., I gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance, if not of total, abstinence; but I fear that my words made no impression. He chuckled\\n\\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Cullingworth and I ran the practice together. As, a substitute for him I was a dreadful failure. They would not believe in, me in the least. I felt that I was as flat as water after champagne., I could not address them from the stairs, nor push them about, nor, prophesy to the anaeemic women. I was much too solemn and demure after, what they had been accustomed to. However, I held the thing together, as best I could, and I don't think that he found the practice much the, worse when he was able to take it over. I could not descend to what I, thought was unprofessional, but I did my very best to keep the wheels, turning.\\n\\ndebating, political, social, athletic, every one of them is a tool to, your hands. But you must show them what a good man you are. You must, throw yourself into each with energy and conviction. You will soon, find yourself on the committee--possibly the secretary, or even in the, presidential chair. Do not grudge labour where the return may be remote, and indirect. Those are the rungs up which one climbs.\\n\\nOur evening occupations just about that time were of a most, extraordinary character. You are aware that there is a substance, called, waxy matter, which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the, course of certain diseases. What this may be and how it is formed has, been a cause for much bickering among pathologists. Cullingworth had, strong views upon the subject, holding that the waxy matter was really, the same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver., But it is one thing to have an idea, and another to be able to prove, it. Above all, we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment. But, fortune favoured us in the most magical way. The Professor of Pathology, had come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition., With pride he exhibited the organ to us in the class-room before, ordering his assistant to remove it to the ice-chest, preparatory to its, being used for microscopical work in the practical class. Cullingworth, saw his chance, and acted on the instant. Slipping out of the classroom\\n\\nseemed to encourage him to become more offensive. At the end of the, match, wanting two to win, I put down the white which was in the jaws of, the pocket. He cried out that this was bad form. I contended that it was, folly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game, and, on, his continuing to make remarks, I appealed to the marker, who took the, same view as I did. This opposition only increased his anger, and he, suddenly broke out into most violent language, abusing me in unmeasured, terms. I said to him, \\\"If you have anything to say to me, Cullingworth\\n\\nwhich was certainly reasonable enough, since no one else could have, written it. Knowing Cullingworth as well as I did, I took it with, reservations and deductions. How could he have made so rapid and, complete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete, stranger? It was incredible. And yet there must be some truth in it, or, he would not invite me to come down and test it. On the whole, I thought, that I had better move very cautiously in the matter; for I was happy, and snug where I was, and kept on putting a little by, which I hoped, would form a nucleus to start me in practice. It is only a few pounds, up to date, but in a year or so it might mount to something. I wrote, to Cullingworth, therefore, thanking him for having remembered me, and, explaining how matters stood.\\n\\nhowever; and if you forced the pace in the morning, he would undress and, go to bed about tea-time, with a full conviction that all the clocks, had gone mad. These two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old, Whitehall had in his own words, \\\"thrown a rope\\\"; and long after I had, gone to bed I could hear the clink of their glasses, and the tapping of, their pipes against the fender in the room below.\\n\\nand use some remarkably bad English. The meaning of it, when all the, \\\"whereas's and aforesaids\\\" were picked out, was, that Winnie had about a, hundred a year of her own. It could not make me love her a shade better, than I did; but at the same time I won't be so absurd as to say that I, was not glad, or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it, would otherwise have been.\\n\\nHe had a dash of the heroic in him. On one occasion he was placed in, such a position that he must choose between compromising a lady, or, springing out of a third-floor window. Without a moment's hesitation he, hurled himself out of the window. As luck would have it, he fell through, a large laurel bush on to a garden plot, which was soft with rain, and, so escaped with a shaking and a bruising. If I have to say anything that, gives a bad impression of the man, put that upon the other side.\\n\\n, I have some recollection, my dear Bertie, that when I wrote you a, rambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago, I wound up, by saying that I might have something more interesting to tell you next, time. Well, so it has turned out! The whole game is up here, and I am, off upon a fresh line of rails altogether. Cullingworth is to go one, way and I another; and yet I am glad to say that there has not been any, quarrel between us. As usual, I have begun my letter at the end, but, I'll work up to it more deliberately now, and let you know exactly how, it came about.\\n\\nIf, Bertie, it had been old student days, I should have sailed straight, in, as you or any other fellow would have done. My flesh crept with my, loathing for the brute. But I had also to think of what I was and where, I was, and what I had come there to do. However, there are some things, which a man cannot stand, so I took a couple of steps forward, put my, hand on the fellow's shoulder, and said in as conciliatory and genial a, voice as I could muster: \\\"Come, come, my lad! Pull yourself together.\\\"\\n\\nThis with her funny manner set the ladies laughing, and the whole, business seemed lighter and easier. I promised to have the room ready, by eight o'clock. Mrs. La Force arranged to bring her son round at that, hour, and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than I deserved;, for after all it was a business matter, and a resident patient was the, very thing that I needed. I was able to assure Mrs. La Force that I, had had a similar case under my charge before--meaning, of course, poor, \\\"Jimmy,\\\" the son of Lord Saltire. Miss Williams escorted them to the, door, and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how I, got through with it, and that I was within sight of my carriage.\\n\\nI recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom, for fear of some imaginary infection. He was haunted, too, with a, perpetual dread of eavesdroppers, which used to make him fly at the door, and fling it open in the middle of his conversation, pouncing out into, the passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act. Once it was, the maid with the tea tray that he caught, I remember; and I can see her, astonished face now, with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar.\\n\\nYou remember that we (Paul and I) had just engaged a certain, Miss Williams to come and keep house for us. I felt that on the, basement-lodger principle I had not control enough; so we now entered, upon a more business-like arrangement, by which a sum (though, alas! an, absurdly small one) was to be paid her for her services. I would it had, been ten times as much, for a better and a more loyal servant man never, had. Our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she re-entered the, house.\\n\\nindirectly I may say that I did so. From that day Lady Saltire was as, rude to me as she could be, and never lost an opportunity of making, attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions. Of these I never, took the slightest notice; but at last on an evil day she went for me, point-blank, so that there was no getting away from her. It was just, at the end of lunch, when the footman had left the room. She had been, talking about Lord Saltire's going up to London to vote upon some, question in the House of Lords.\\n\\nBertie. I send you one or two enormously long letters, burdened, as far, as I can remember them, with all sorts of useless detail. Then, in spite, of your kindly answers and your sympathy, which I have done so little to, deserve, I drop you completely for more than six months. By this J pen, I swear that it shall not happen again; and this letter may serve to, bridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs, in which\\n\\nNo, you mustn't be too sure of that majority of yours. Taking the, scientific, the medical, the professional classes, I question whether it, exists at all. The clergy, busy in their own limited circles, and coming, in contact only with those who agree with them, have not realised how, largely the rising generation has outgrown them. And (with exceptions, like yourself) it is not the most lax, but the BEST of the younger men\\n\\n\\\"As to the magnet,\\\" said he, \\\"I'm very sorry for my country, but there, is no more command of the seas for her. I'll have to let the thing go, to the Germans. It's not my fault. They must not blame me when the smash, comes. I put the thing before the Admiralty, and I could have made a, board school understand it in half the time. Such letters, Munro! Colney, Hatch on blue paper. When the war comes, and I show those letters\\n\\nundisturbed. My tastes are so simple that I cannot imagine any advantage, which wealth can give--save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a, good man or a good cause. Why should people ever take credit for charity, when they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their, guineas in any other fashion? I gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster, the other day (having no change in my pocket), and the mater could not, quite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility. I, could have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one, nor the other, but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little, dash of swagger away down at the bottom of it. What had I ever had from, my chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow, brought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had, been useful?\\n\\nAnd so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that I could not, come. It is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life, obviously divides, and you take one turning or the other after vainly, trying to be sure about the finger-post. I think after all I chose, rightly. A ship's surgeon must remain a ship's surgeon, while here there, is no horizon to my possibilities.\\n\\n\\\"Just exactly in South America,\\\" he cried, pacing with his quick little, steps up and down the dingy room. \\\"Look here, laddie! There's a great, continent from the equator to the icebergs, and not a man in it who, could correct an astigmatism. What do they know of modern eye-surgery, and refraction? Why, dammy, they don't know much about it in the, provinces of England yet, let alone Brazil. Man, if you could only see, it, there's a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round, the whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for, an oculist. Eh, Munro, what? By Crums, I'll come back and I'll buy, Bradfield, and I'll give it away as a tip to a waiter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I'm sorry we haven't got a crowded day for you, Munro,\\\" said he., \\\"Of course, we can't command these things, and must take them as they, come. Now then, now then, make a gangway, can't you?\\\"--this to his, patients. \\\"Come here and see the waiting-room. Pooh! what an atmosphere!, Why on earth can't you open the windows for yourselves? I never saw, such folk! There are thirty people in this room, Munro, and not one with, sense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation.\\\"\\n\\nAt one end of Cadogan Terrace (where I am lodging) there is a wide open, space where several streets meet. In the centre of this stands a large, lamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal, a foot or so high, and ten, or twelve across. Well, as I strolled along I saw there was something, going on round this lamppost. A crowd of people had gathered, with a, swirl in the centre. I was, of course, absolutely determined not to get, mixed up in any row; but I could not help pushing my way through the, crowd to see what was the matter.\\n\\nYou met her, Bertie! You must remember her sweet face, her sensitive, mouth, her peering, short-sighted eyes, her general suggestion of a, plump little hen, who is still on the alert about her chickens. But you, cannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life. Those helpful, fingers! That sympathetic brain! Ever since I can remember her she has, been the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters\\n\\nhave it adopted in every civilised country, see all conceivable, applications of it, count up his probable royalties, sketch out the, novel methods in which he would invest his gains, and finally retire, with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed. And you would, be swept along by his words, and would be carried every foot of the, way with him, so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you, suddenly fell back to earth again, and found yourself trudging the city, street a poor student, with Kirk's Physiology under your arm, and hardly, the price of your luncheon in your pocket.\\n\\nHe began to laugh at that. \\\"It was a little precipitate on my part,\\\", said he; \\\"but I do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to, position or terms. You may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of, our client, Lord Saltire? Not? To put it briefly then, his son, the Hon., James Derwent, the heir to the estates and the only child, was struck, down by the sun while fishing without his hat last July. His mind has, never recovered from the shock, and he has been ever since in a chronic, state of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into, violent mania. His father will not allow him to be removed from, Lochtully Castle, and it is his desire that a medical man should stay, there in constant attendance upon his son. Your physical strength would, of course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which, I have spoken. The remuneration will be twelve pounds a month, and you, would be required to take over your duties to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nI assure you that I have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as, to whence I have come from, whither I am going, or what I am here for., It is not for want of inquiry, or from indifference. I have mastered, the principles of several religions. They have all shocked me by the, violence which I should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of, any one of them. Their ethics are usually excellent. So are the ethics, of the common law of England. But the scheme of creation upon which, those ethics are built! Well, it really is to me the most astonishing, thing that I have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage, that so many, able men, deep philosophers, astute lawyers, and clear-headed men of, the world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life. In the, face of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not, dare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul, were it not that, I take courage when I reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and, philosophers of Rome and Greece were all agreed that Jupiter had, numerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine.\\n\\nThat was how, when I had gained some sort of opening, I set to work to, enlarge it. I joined this. I joined that. I pushed in every direction., I took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health, and found, that the practice benefited as well as I. My cricket form for the season, has been fair, with an average of about 20 with the bat and 9 with the, ball.\\n\\nThose whom I love best are those who have least sympathy with my, struggles. They talk about having faith, as if it could be done by an, act of volition. They might as well tell me to have black hair instead, of red. I might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all, in religious matters. But I will never be traitor to the highest thing, that God has given me. I WILL use it. It is more moral to use it and go, wrong, than to forego it and be right. It is only a little foot-rule\\n\\nBesides this decline in his practice, I was sorry to hear that, Cullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion, which had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits., His whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it, but as far, back as I can remember it had been a characteristic. Even in those, early days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocer's shop\\n\\nAgain, out of three shutters which belonged to the room, I rigged up a, very effective side-table for my own den, which when covered with a, red cloth, and ornamented with the bears' paws, might have cost twenty, guineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary. I had done, all this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow, which I shall have to tell you about, came upon me.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand me, and quote me as saying that it is a good thing, for a nation that it should have many drunkards. Nothing of the kind., What I say is, that if a nation has many morally weak people, then it, is good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains., Nature has her devices, and drink is among them. When there are no more, drunkards and reprobates, it means that the race is so advanced that it, no longer needs such rough treatment. Then the all-wise Engineer will, speed us along in some other fashion.\\n\\nWell, my dear Bertie, a happy and tranquil, if not very ambitious, existence stretches before us. We are both in our twenty-fifth year, and, I suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirty-five more, years lie in front of us. I can foresee the gradually increasing routine, of work, the wider circle of friends, the indentification with this or, that local movement, with perhaps a seat on the Bench, or at least, in the Municipal Council in my later years. It's not a very startling, programme, is it? But it lies to my hand, and I see no other. I should, dearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my, presence. Even on this small stage we have our two sides, and something, might be done by throwing all one's weight on the scale of breadth\\n\\nI am quite ashamed of having been so didactic. But it is fine to think, that sin may have an object and work towards good. My father says that, I seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property, and can't be, happy until I know that all is right with it. Well, it does send a, glow through me when I seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the, clouds.\\n\\n\\\"Well, he's been dead seven years, and fifty nets dipping into his, little fish-pond. However, when I passed I thought my best move was to, come down to the old place, and see whether I couldn't piece the thing, together again. The name ought to be worth something, I thought. But it, was no use doing the thing in a half hearted way. Not a bit of use in, that, Munro. The kind of people who came to him were wealthy, and must, see a fine house and a man in livery. What chance was there of gathering, them into a bow-windowed forty pound-a-year house with a grubby-faced, maid at the door? What do you suppose I did? My boy, I took the, governor's old house, that was unlet--the very house that he kept up at, five thousand a year. Off I started in rare style, and sank my last cent, in furniture. But it's no use, laddie. I can't hold on any longer. I, got two accidents and an epileptic--twenty-two pounds, eight and, sixpence--that's the lot!\\n\\nBut every movement has its crowd of camp followers, who straggle and, scatter. We are like a comet, bright at the head but tailing away into, mere gas behind. However, every man may speak for himself, and I do, not feel that your charge comes home to me. I am only bigoted against, bigotry, and that I hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent., When one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct, has had during the history of the world; the bitter wars, Christian and, Mahomedan, Catholic and Protestant; the persecutions, the torturings\\n\\nI had an adventure upon the way to Bradfield. The carriage in which, I was travelling contained a party of three, at whom I took the most, casual of glances before settling down to the daily paper. There was an, elderly lady, with a bright rosy face, gold spectacles, and a dash of, red velvet in her bonnet. With her were two younger people, who I took, to be her son and her daughter--the one a quiet, gentle-looking girl of, twenty or so, dressed in black, and the other a short, thick-set young, fellow, a year or two older. The two ladies sat by each other in the, far corner, and the son (as I presume him to be) sat opposite me. We may, have travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to, this little family party, save that I could not help hearing some talk, between the two ladies. The younger, who was addressed as Winnie, had\\n\\nThat was the first of my morning incidents. My second followed hard upon, the heels of it. Another ring came, and from my post of observation I, saw that a gipsy's van, hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs, had, drawn up at the door. Two or three people appeared to be standing, outside. I understood that they wished me to purchase some of their, wares, so I merely opened the door about three inches, said \\\"No, thank, you,\\\" and closed it. They seemed not to have heard me for they rang, again, upon which I opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly., Imagine my surprise when they rang again. I flung the door open, and was, about to ask them what they meant by their impudence, when one of the, little group upon my doorstep said, \\\"If you please, sir, it's the baby.\\\", Never was there such a change--from the outraged householder to the, professional man. \\\"Pray step in, madam,\\\" said I, in quite my most, courtly style; and in they all came--the husband, the brother, the wife, and the baby. The latter was in the early stage of measles. They were, poor outcast sort of people, and seemed not to have sixpence among them;, so my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in, my giving the medicine for nothing, and finally adding fivepence in, coppers, which was all the small change I had. A few more such patients, and I am a broken man.\\n\\nwith ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me, left, so jauntily by the tax-collector, and meaning such a dead-weight pull to, me. The irony of my paying a poor-rate used to amuse me. I should have, been collecting it. Thrice at a crisis I pawned my watch, and thrice I, rallied and rescued it. But how am I to interest you in the details of, such a career? Now, if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on, a piece of orange peel before my door, or if the chief merchant in the, town had been saved by some tour-de-force upon my part, or if I had, been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely, house with a princely fee for silence--then I should have something, worthy of your attention. But the long months and months during which, I listened to the throb of the charwoman's heart and the rustle of the, greengrocer's lungs, present little which is not dull and dreary. No, good angels came my way.\\n\\nMy chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke, and I assure you that, I was within an ace of going over. Down like a pack of cards came all my, dreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to, Avonmouth. Yes, Bertie, I am bound to confess it: my first thought was, of my own disappointment, and my second of the misfortune of my friends., He had the most diabolical intuitions, or I a very tell-tale face, for, he added at once--\\n\\n\\\"What is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound.\\\" He shoots off, a whole column of aphorisms in a single evening. I should like to have, a man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste. No; you, must not let me give you a false impression of the man's capacity., On the other hand, it would be dishonest to deny that I think him, thoroughly unscrupulous, and full of very sinister traits. I am much, mistaken, however, if he has not fine strata in his nature. He is, capable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths.\\n\\nWell, as I said, my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down, into the bulb, when on looking through the gathering gloom I saw, \\\"Merton\\\" printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station. I got out, and, was standing beside my trunk and my hat-box, waiting for a porter, when, up came a cheery-looking fellow and asked me whether I was Dr. Stark, Munro. \\\"I'm Horton,\\\" said he; and shook hands cordially.\\n\\n, My dear old chap, things have been happening, and I must tell you all, about it. Sympathy is a strange thing; for though I never see you, the, mere fact that you over there in New England are keenly interested in, what I am doing and thinking, makes my own life in old England very much, more interesting to me. The thought of you is like a good staff in my, right hand.\\n\\nAnd now I have worked my way to the point where I can show you what I, mean when I talk about fate. The medical practitioner who lives next, me--Porter is his name--is a kindly sort of man, and knowing that I have, had a long uphill fight, he has several times put things in my way., One day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after, breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"There you are!\\\" he would suddenly yell; \\\"see that man with a limp!, Every morning he goes. Displaced semilunar cartilage, and a three, months' job. The man's worth thirty-five shillings a week. And there!, I'm hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isn't round in, her bath-chair again. She's all sealskin and lactic acid. It's simply, sickening to see how they crowd to that man. And such a man! You haven't, seen him. All the better for you. I don't know what the devil you are, laughing at, Munro. I can't see where the fun comes in myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you frankly, old chap,\\\" said he, putting on suddenly that, sort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a, sneer in it. \\\"You see, many of my patients are simple country folk, half, imbecile for the most part, but then the half-crown of an imbecile is, as good as any other half-crown. They come to my door, and they see two, names, and their silly jaws begin to drop, and they say to each other\\n\\nHave you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts? We had one, in Cullingworth's practice just before his illness, and we were both, much excited about it. They seem to me to be one of those wee little, chinks through which one may see deep into Nature's workings. In this, case the fellow, who was a clerk in the post office, came to us with a, swelling over his eyebrow. We opened it under the impression that it was, an abscess, and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth, in it. You know that such cases are common enough in surgery, and that, no pathological museum is without an example.\\n\\nYes, Horton is a real right-down good fellow. His heart is broad and, kind and generous. There is nothing petty in the man. He loves to see, those around him happy; and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red, face goes far to make them so. Nature meant him to be a healer; for he, brightens up a sick room as he did the Merton station when first I set, eyes upon him. Don't imagine from my description that he is in any, way soft, however. There is no one on whom one could be less likely to, impose. He has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased., A mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into, the surgery like a whiff of cast wind, his checks red, his whiskers, bristling, and his eyes malignant. The daybook is banged, the bottles, rattled, the counter thumped, and then he is off again with five doors, slamming behind him. We can trace his progress when the black mood is on, him by those dwindling slams. Perhaps it is that McCarthy has labelled, the cough mixture as the eye-wash, or sent an empty pillbox with an, exhortation to take one every four hours. In any case the cyclone comes, and goes, and by the next meal all is peace once more.\\n\\nThis is all a digression, however, from the fact that I have been six, months at home and am weary of it, and pleased at the new development, of which I shall have to tell you. The practice here, although, unremunerative, is very busy with its three-and-sixpenny visits and, guinea confinements, so that both the governor and I have had plenty, to do. You know how I admire him, and yet I fear there is little, intellectual sympathy between us. He appears to think that those, opinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my, inmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado. So, I have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him, and, though we affect, to ignore it, we both know that there is a barrier there. Now, with my, mother--ah, but my mother must have a paragraph to herself.\\n\\nThe inside of the house was even huger than I had thought from the look, of the exterior. There were over thirty bedrooms, Cullingworth informed, me, as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs. The hall and first, stair were most excellently furnished and carpetted, but it all run, to nothing at the landing. My own bedroom had a little iron bed, and a, small basin standing on a packing case. Cullingworth took a hammer from, the mantelpiece, and began to knock in nails behind the door.\\n\\nShortly afterwards Jack went away to sea again; and after his departure, there were several furious quarrels between the women down below, which, filled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees. At last one, evening Miss Williams--the quiet one--came to me and announced with sobs, that she must go. Mrs. Wotton made her life unbearable, she said. She, was determined to be independent, and had fitted up a small shop in a, poor quarter of the town. She was going now, at once, to take possession, of it.\\n\\nAnd with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an, elemental religion. Come what may after death, our duties lie clearly, defined before us in this life; and the ethical standard of all creeds, agrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion, as to that. The last reformation simplified Catholicism. The coming one, will simplify Protestantism. And when the world is ripe for it another, will come and simplify that. The ever improving brain will give us an, ever broadening creed. Is it not glorious to think that evolution, is still living and acting--that if we have an anthropoid ape as an, ancestor, we may have archangels for our posterity?\\n\\n\\\"You believe far too much what James says,\\\" said she. \\\"You don't know, him in the least, Mr. Munro. You don't look at a thing from his point, of view, and you will never understand him until you do. It is not, of, course, that he means to say anything that is untrue; but his fancy is, excited, and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea, whether, it tells against himself or not. It hurts me, Mr. Munro, to see the, only man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship\\n\\nYou see by the address of this letter that I still hold my ground, but, between ourselves it has been a terrible fight, and there have been, times when that last plank of which old Whitehall wrote seemed to be, slipping out of my clutch. I have ebbed and flowed, sometimes with a, little money, sometimes without. At my best I was living hard, at my, worst I was very close upon starvation. I have lived for a whole day, upon the crust of a loaf, when I had ten pounds in silver in the drawer, of my table. But those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped, together for my quarter's rent, and I would have tried twenty-four hours, with a tight leather belt before I would have broken in upon it. For two, days I could not raise a stamp to send a letter. I have smiled when I, have read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in Egypt., Their broken victuals would have been a banquet to me. However, what, odds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen, as long as you DO, get it? The garrison of Oakley Villa has passed the worst, and there is, no talk of surrender.\\n\\nbeginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer, than friendship. You squeeze the slender arm which is passed through, yours, you venture to take the little gloved hand, you say good night, at absurd length in the shadow of the door. It is innocent and very, interesting, love trying his wings in a first little flutter. He will, keep his sustained flight later on, the better for the practice. There, was never any question of engagements between us, nor any suggestion of, harm. She knew that I was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects\\n\\n\\\"Because I know better. My boy, I'm a doctor's son, and I've seen too, much of it. I was born inside the machine, and I've seen all the wires., All this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of, the older men. It's to hold the young men back, and to stop the holes by, which they might slip through to the front. I've heard my father say so, a score of times. He had the largest practice in Scotland, and yet he, was absolutely devoid of brains. He slipped into it through seniority, and decorum. No pushing, but take your turn. Very well, laddie, when, you're at the top of the line, but how about it when you've just taken, your place at the tail? When I'm on the top rung I shall look down and, say, 'Now, you youngsters, we are going to have very strict etiquette\\n\\nand I had always defended him; but I was forced now to confess that she, had been right from the beginning. I said enough to show him that I, saw through his whole plot; and I wound up by assuring him that if he, thought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake; for I had, every reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the, very opening which I had most desired myself.\\n\\nand now I find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen;, so I am moving in the right direction. Of course, it compares absurdly, enough with Cullingworth's twenty pound a day, and my little quiet, back-water seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for, ever through his room. Still, I am quite satisfied, and I have no doubt, at all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first, year will be amply justified. It would be a pleasant thing to think that, if anything were really to happen at home, I should be able to be of, some use to them. If things go on as they have begun, I shall soon have, my feet firmly planted.\\n\\nThen I proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of, exploration. There were two upon the ground floor, sixteen feet square, each, and I saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair, condition. The front one would make a consulting room, the other a, waiting room, though I did not care to reflect who was most likely to do, the waiting. I was in the highest spirits, and did a step dance in each, room as an official inauguration.\\n\\nYou'll find my physiology even worse than my theology, Bertie. I have, a way of telling stories backwards to you, which is natural enough when, you consider that I always sit down to write under the influence of the, last impressions which have come upon me. All this talk about the soul, and the brain arises simply from the fact that I have been spending the, last few weeks with a lunatic. And how it came about I will tell you as, clearly as I can.\\n\\nNow, you will think me rather prolix about this man; but, as it looks, as if his life might become entwined with mine, it is a subject of, immediate interest to me, and I am writing all this for the purpose, of reviving my own half-faded impressions, as well as in the hope of, amusing and interesting you. So I must just give you one or two other, points which may make his character more clear to you.\\n\\nI had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases. One, (which was of immense importance to me) was that of a grocer named, Haywood, who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop. I was, passing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid. You may believe, that I saw my chance, bustled in, treated the man, conciliated the wife\\n\\nand he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast. The cooking, was to be done at a neighbouring confectioner's. The landlady's son, was coming in to wait. I was sorry to see that Whitehall was already, slurring his words together, and had evidently been priming himself, heavily. He looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time, we should have. So-and-so could talk well, and the other man could sing, a song. He was so far gone by now, that I ventured (in the capacity of, medical adviser) to speak to him about it.\\n\\nI was to go back to my father's that day, but I had a couple of hours, with Cullingworth in his consulting room before I left. He was in his, best form, and full of a hundred fantastic schemes, by which I was to, help him. His great object was to get his name into the newspapers. That, was the basis of all success, according to his views. It seemed to, me that he was confounding cause with effect; but I did not argue the, point. I laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions, which poured from him. I was to lie senseless in the roadway, and to be, carried into him by a sympathising crowd, while the footman ran with a, paragraph to the newspapers. But there was the likelihood that the, crowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite. In various, disguises I was to feign fits at his very door, and so furnish fresh, copy for the local press. Then I was to die--absolutely to expire--and, all Scotland was to resound with how Dr. Cullingworth, of Avonmouth, had, resuscitated me. His ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of, the idea, and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his, thoughts by the flood of half-serious devices.\\n\\nI daresay you've quite come to the conclusion by this time that, Cullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study--a man in the, first stage of lunacy or general paralysis. You might not be so sure, about it if you were in close contact with him. He justifies his wildest, flights by what he does. It sounds grotesque when put down in black and, white; but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he, had said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth. Now we, see that he has done it. His possibilities are immense. He has such, huge energy at the back of his fertility of invention. I am afraid, on, thinking over all that I have written to you, that I may have given you, a false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents, in which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character, and, omitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a, chance. His conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is, full of pith and idea. \\\"The greatest monument ever erected to Napoleon, Buonaparte was the British National debt,\\\" said he yesterday. Again\\n\\nthen, is he? He does not lie in the features which are to express his, emotions, nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the, blind and deaf. Nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over, which nature hangs her veil of flesh. In none of these things lies the, essence of the man. And now what is left? An arched whitish putty-like, mass, some fifty odd ounces in weight, with a number of white filaments, hanging down from it, looking not unlike the medusae which float in our, summer seas. But these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force, to muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes. They may, themselves therefore be disregarded. Nor can we stop here in our, elimination. This central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on, all sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul. Suicides, have shot away the front lobes of the brain, and have lived to repent, it. Surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections. Much of it, is merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion, and much, for the reception of impressions. All this may be put aside as we search, for the physical seat of what we call the soul--the spiritual part of, the man. And what is left then? A little blob of matter, a handful of, nervous dough, a few ounces of tissue, but there--somewhere there--lurks, that impalpable seed, to which the rest of our frame is but the pod. The, old philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right\\n\\nThen, there is her family pride. That is a very vital portion of the, mother. You know how little I think of such things. If the Esquire were, to be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name I should be, the lighter for it. But, ma foi!--to use her own favourite expletive--it, would not do to say this to her. On the Packenham side (she is a, Packenham) the family can boast of some fairly good men--I mean on the, direct line--but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch, upon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree. Not once, nor, twice, but thrice did the Plantagenets intermarry with us, the Dukes, of Brittany courted our alliance, and the Percies of Northumberland, intertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record. So in my, boyhood she would expound the matter, with hearthbrush in one hand and, a glove full of cinders in the other, while I would sit swinging my, knickerbockered legs, swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as, tight as a sausage skin, as I contemplated the gulf which separated me, from all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables. To this, day if I chance to do anything of which she strongly approves, the dear, heart can say no more than that I am a thorough Packenham; while if I, fall away from the straight path, she says with a sigh that there are, points in which I take after the Munros.\\n\\nBut, my goodness, where have I got to? All this comes from the, Birchespool lamp-posts and curb-stones. And I sat down to write such a, practical letter too! However, I give you leave to be as dogmatic and, didactic as you like in return. Cullingworth says my head is like a, bursting capsule, with all the seeds getting loose. Poor seed, too, I, fear, but some of it may lodge somewhere--or not, as Fate pleases.\\n\\ntherefore, and conveyed him to his home, I sitting with my most, professional air, and he standing straight up between my hands. The, carriage went at a walk, and the crowd trailed behind, with all the folk, looking out of the windows, so that a more glorious advertisement could, not be conceived. It looked like the advance guard of a circus. Once at, his house, however, professional etiquette demanded that I should hand, the case over to the family attendant, which I did with as good a grace, as possible--not without some lingering hope that the old established, practitioner might say, \\\"You have taken such very good care of my, patient, Dr. Munro, that I should not dream of removing him from your, hands.\\\" On the contrary, he snatched it away from me with avidity, and I, retired with some credit, an excellent advertisement, and a guinea.\\n\\nFor the next three days I had not a single ring at the bell of any sort, whatever. A man could not be more isolated from his kind. It used to, amuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passers-by stopped to, look at my plate. Once (on a Sunday morning) there were over a hundred, in an hour, and often I could see from their glancing over their, shoulders as they walked on, that they were thinking or talking of the, new doctor.\\n\\nMedical men, according to his view, have been afraid of producing a, poisonous effect with their drugs. With him, on the contrary, the, whole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning, and when the case, is serious, his remedies are heroic. Where, in epilepsy, I should have, given thirty-grain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours, he, would give two drachms every three. No doubt it will seem to you very, kill-or-cure, and I am myself afraid that a succession of coroners', inquests may check Cullingworth's career; but hitherto he has had no, public scandal, while the cases which he has brought back to life have, been numerous. He is the most fearless fellow. I have seen him pour, opium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled. But either his, knowledge or his luck always brings him out right.\\n\\nOne curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me., She is a stately looking widow, Turner by name, the most depressingly, respectable figure, as of Mrs. Grundy's older and less frivolous sister., She lives in a tiny house, with one small servant to scale. Well, every, two months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink, which lasts for, about a week. It ends as abruptly as it begins, but while it is on the, neighbours know it. She shrieks, yells, sings, chivies the servant\\n\\nBut in all soberness, I really do think, Bertie, that very much which, seems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it, properly. I tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink, and immorality. But physically, I fancy that it applies more obviously, than it does morally. All the physical evils of life seem to culminate, in death; and yet death, as I have seen it, has not been a painful or, terrible process. In many cases, a man dies without having incurred, nearly as much pain, during the whole of his fatal illness, as would, have arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw. And it is often, those deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker, which are least, so to the sufferer. When a man is overtaken by an express and shivered, into fragments, or when he drops from a fourth-floor window and, is smashed into a bag of splinters, the unfortunate spectators are, convulsed with horror, and find a text for pessimistic views about the, Providence which allows such things to be. And yet, it is very doubtful, whether the deceased, could his tongue be loosened, would remember, anything at all about the matter. We know, as students of medicine\\n\\nI said that the patients were very homely. Any one who is over-starched, might well come here to be unstiffened. I confess that I did not quite, fall in with it at once. When on one of my first mornings a club patient, with his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if I were the, doctor's man, I sent him on to see the groom in the stable. But soon one, falls into the humour of it. There is no offence meant; and why should, any be taken? They are kindly, generous folk; and if they pay no respect, to your profession in the abstract, and so rather hurt your dignity\\n\\n'There's two of 'em here. It's Dr. Cullingworth we want to see, but if, we go in we'll be shown as likely as not to Dr. Munro.' So it ends in, some cases in their not coming at all. Then there are the women. Women, don't care a toss whether you are a Solomon, or whether you are hot from, an asylum. It's all personal with them. You fetch them, or you don't, fetch them. I know how to work them, but they won't come if they think, they are going to be turned over to anybody else. That's what I put the, falling away down to.\\\"\\n\\nand man's form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine, we, walked amid the pealings of the \\\"Wedding March\\\" into the vestry, where, my dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the, register in the wrong place, so that to all appearance it was she who, had just married the clergyman. And then amid congratulations and kindly, faces, we were together, her hand on my forearm, upon the steps of the, church, and saw the familiar road stretching before us. But it was, not that road which lay before my eyes, but rather the path of our, lives;--that broader path on which our feet were now planted, so, pleasant to tread, and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist. Was, it long, or was it short? Was it uphill, or was it down? For her, at, least, it should be smooth, if a man's love could make it so.\\n\\n\\\"When the maid was arranging your room after your departure, she cleared, some pieces of torn paper from under the grate. Seeing my name upon, them, she brought them, as in duty bound, to her mistress, who pasted, them together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to, you, in which I am referred to in the vilest terms, such as 'a bankrupt, swindler' and 'the unscrupulous Cullingworth.' I can only say that we, are astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence, while you were a guest under our roof, and we refuse to have anything, more to do with you in any shape or form.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly, qualified medical men. The Cullingworths vanished away, and I never, heard any more of them, for he was a man who prided himself upon never, writing a letter. His father had formerly a very large and lucrative, practice in the West of Scotland, but he died some years ago. I had a, vague idea, founded upon some chance remark of his, that Cullingworth, had gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good, stead there. As for me I began, as you will remember that I explained, in my last, by acting as assistant in my father's practice. You know\\n\\nIt is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the, views of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive, and will wait, resignedly for what fate may send him. The objector forgets that among, the other things fated is that we of northern blood SHOULD strive and, should NOT sit down with folded hands. But when a man has striven, when, he has done all he knows, and when, in spite of it, a thing comes to, pass, let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune. It, is part of the main line of his destiny then, and is working to an end., A man loses his fortune; he gains earnestness. His eyesight goes; it, leads him to a spirituality. The girl loses her beauty; she becomes more, sympathetic. We think we are pushing our own way bravely, but there is a, great Hand in ours all the time.\\n\\nThe man who claims that we can know nothing is, to my mind, as, unreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely, revealed to us. I know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type, of scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know, but has not, imagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of, doubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance., He is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws\\n\\nLook at it in this way. We know that many of the permanent facts of the, universe are NOT chance. It is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing, clear of each other, that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which, will drift it to a congenial soil, that the creature is adapted to its, environment. Show me a whale with its great-coat of fat, and I want no, further proof of design. But logically, as it seems to me, ALL must be, design, or all must be chance. I do not see how one can slash a line, right across the universe, and say that all to the right of that is, chance, and all to the left is pre-ordained. You would then have to, contend that things which on the face of them are of the same class, are, really divided by an impassable gulf, and that the lower are regulated\\n\\nI tell you these trivial matters, my dear Bertie, just to show you that, I am not down on my luck, and that my life is not pitched in the minor, key altogether, in spite of my queer situation. But, to turn to graver, things: I was right glad to get your letter, and to read all your, denunciations about dogmatic science. Don't imagine that my withers are, wrung by what you say, for I agree with almost every word of it.\\n\\nThe moment I looked him in the face I smelled mischief. He had a gleam, of settled malice in his eye. I believe it was my refusal to back his, paper which was running in his head. Anyway he looked as dangerous as he, could look, with his scowling face sunk forward a little, his hands, down near his hips (for his boxing, like everything else about him, is, unconventional), and his jaw set like a rat-trap.\\n\\nVery sober to outward seeming, but in a frenzy within, he went down to, the station one night, and, stooping to the pigeon-hole, he asked the, ticket-clerk, in the suavest voice, whether he could tell him how far, it was to London. The official put forward his face to reply when, Cullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a, piston. The clerk flew backwards off his stool, and his yell of pain and, indignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance., They pursued Cullingworth; but he, as active and as fit as a greyhound\\n\\nSo there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices, and wonderful introductions! I believe the only person in the whole, house who regretted me was Jimmy, who was quite downcast at the news., His grief, however, did not prevent him from brushing my new top-hat, the wrong way on the morning that I left. I did not notice it until I, reached the station, and a most undignified object I must have looked, when I took my departure.\\n\\nI ask myself, where is the man, the very, very inmost essence of the, man? See how much you may subtract from him without touching it. It does, not lie in the limbs which serve him as tools, nor in the apparatus by, which he is to digest, nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen. All, these are mere accessories, the slaves of the lord within. Where\\n\\ncataracts, iritis, refractions, what you like; here's the great Signor, Cullingworth, right up to date and ready for anything!' In they come of, course, droves of them, and then I arrive and take the money. Here's, my luggage!\\\" he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room., \\\"Those are glasses, my boy, concave and convex, hundreds of them. I test, an eye, fit him on the spot, and send him away shouting. Then I load, up a steamer and come home, unless I elect to buy one of their little, States and run it.\\\"\\n\\nYou will wonder, perhaps, how we get on--my wife and I--in the matter, of religion. Well, we both go our own ways. Why should I proselytise? I, would not for the sake of abstract truth take away her child-like faith, which serves to make life easier and brighter to her. I have made myself, ill-understood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in, them any bitterness against the orthodox creeds. Far from saying that, they are all false, it would express my position better to say that they, are all true. Providence would not have used them were they not the best, available tools, and in that sense divine. That they are final I deny. A, simpler and more universal creed will take their place, when the mind of, man is ready for it; and I believe it will be a creed founded upon those, lines of absolute and provable truth which I have indicated. But the old, creeds are still the best suited to certain minds, and to certain ages., If they are good enough for Providence to use, they are good enough for, us to endure. We have but to wait upon the survival of the truest. If I, have seemed to say anything aggressive against them, it was directed, at those who wish to limit the Almighty's favour to their own little, clique, or who wish to build a Chinese wall round religion, with no, assimilation of fresh truths, and no hope of expansion in the future. It, is with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce. As for my, wife, I would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers, as, she would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table., She is not narrow in her views; but if one could stand upon the very, topmost pinnacle of broad-mindedness, one would doubtless see from it, that even the narrow have their mission.\\n\\nonly I may have been a little more emphatic. \\\"Pain in the jaw,\\\" said he., \\\"You needn't make such a noise,\\\" said I; \\\"other people are ill besides, you.\\\" \\\"If I pay my money, young man, I'll make such noise as I like.\\\", And actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door., He would have gone on with his devil's tattoo all morning if I had not, led him down the path and seen him off the premises. An hour afterwards, Horton whirled into the surgery, with a trail of banged doors behind, him. \\\"What's this about Mr. Usher, Munro?\\\" he asked. \\\"He says that you, were violent towards him.\\\" \\\"There was a club patient here who kept on, banging the knocker,\\\" said I; \\\"I was afraid that he would disturb Mrs., White, and so I made him stop.\\\" Horton's eyes began to twinkle. \\\"My, boy,\\\" said he, \\\"that club patient, as you call him, is the richest man, in Merton, and worth a hundred a year to me.\\\" I have no doubt that he, appeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation; but I have not, heard anything of the matter since.\\n\\nthat there was no getting away from him. He was on me once more with, a regular football rush that knocked me off my balance. Before I knew, where I was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear. I, tripped over a footstool, and then before I could get my balance he had, me on the same ear again, and my head was singing like a tea-kettle., He was as pleased as possible with himself, blowing out his chest and, slapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the, room.\\n\\n\\\"By God, Dr. Munro, sir, I'm the man that's going to stick to you. I'm, only an old sailor-man, sir, with perhaps more liquor than sense; but, I'm the Queen's servant, and touch my pension every quarter day. I, don't claim to be R. N., but I'm not merchant service either. Here I, am, rotting in lodgings, but by ----, Dr. Munro, sir, I carried seven, thousand stinking Turks from Varna to Balaclava Bay. I'm with you, Dr., Munro, and we put this thing through together.\\\"\\n\\nwhen only a senior midshipman, lost the sight of one eye and the use of, one arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable Pah in, the Maori war. The other was a sad-faced poetical-looking man, of, good birth as I understood, who had been disowned by his family on the, occasion of his eloping with the cook. His name was Carr, and his chief, peculiarity, that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could, always tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in., He would cock his head, think over his own symptoms, and then give, you the hour fairly correctly. An unusual drink would disarrange him\\n\\nI led off, and then in he came hitting with both hands, and grunting, like a pig at every blow. From what I could see of him he was no boxer, at all, but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter. I was guarding, with both hands for half a minute, and then was rushed clean off my legs, and banged up against the door, with my head nearly through one of the, panels. He wouldn't stop then, though he saw that I had no space to get, my elbows back; and he let fly a right-hander which would have put me, into the hall, if I hadn't slipped it and got back to the middle of the, room.\\n\\nFred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time. I, gave him his usual dose last thing at night; and then, as he seemed to, be sleeping peacefully, I went to my own room for the rest which I badly, needed. I did not wake until eight in the morning, when I was roused, by the jingling of a spoon in a saucer, and the step of Miss Williams, passing my door. She was taking him the arrowroot which I had ordered, over-night. I heard her open the door, and the next moment my heart, sprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream, and her cup and saucer, crashed upon the floor. An instant later she had burst into my room\\n\\nand all these bodies for? Eh, laddie? For encouraging the best interests, of the profession. Do you suppose they do that by making the, population healthy? It's about time we had a mutiny among the general, practitioners. If I had the use of half the funds which the Association, has, I should spend part of them in drain-blocking, and the rest in the, cultivation of disease germs, and the contamination of drinking water.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we came down to the dining-room for supper, Mrs. Cullingworth was, waiting there to greet me. I was sorry to see that she was pale and, weary-looking. However, we had a merry meal in the old style, and her, husband's animation reflected itself upon her face, until at last we, might have been back in the little room, where the Medical Journals, served as a chair, instead of in the great oak-furnished, picture-hung, chamber to which we had been promoted. All the time, however, not one, word as to the object of my journey.\\n\\nWhen I came back I settled down once more to the routine of my father's, practice, holding on there until something may turn up. And for six, months I have had to wait; a weary six months they have been. You see I, cannot ask my father for money--or, at least, I cannot bring myself to, take an unnecessary penny of his money--for I know how hard a fight, it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest, little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose, is to a tailor. Foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of, guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury! We can just hold, on, and I would not have him a pound the poorer for me. But you can, understand, Bertie, that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have, to go about without any money in my pocket. It affects me in so many, petty ways. A poor man may do me a kindness, and I have to seem mean in, his eyes. I may want a flower for a girl, and must be content to appear, ungallant. I don't know why I should be ashamed of this, since it is no, fault of mine, and I hope that I don't show it to any one else that I AM, ashamed of it; but to you, my dear Bertie, I don't mind confessing that, it hurts my self-respect terribly.\\n\\nAfter this bit of bravado I felt better, and I thought over the, situation. I was alone in a strange town, without connections, without, introductions, with less than a pound in my pocket, and with no, possibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities. I had no one at, all to look to for help, for all my recent letters from home had given a, dreary account of the state of things there. My poor father's health and, his income were dwindling together. On the other hand, I reflected that, there were some points in my favour. I was young. I was energetic. I had, been brought up hard, and was quite prepared to rough it. I was well up, in my work, and believed I could get on with patients. My house was an, excellent one for my purpose, and I had already put the essentials of, furniture into it. The game was not played out yet. I jumped to my feet, and clenched my hand, and swore to the chandelier that it never should, be played out until I had to beckon for help from the window.\\n\\nRound he came, and very helpful he was. He seemed to know all about the, procedure--\\\"Buried two wives, Dr. Munro, sir!\\\" I signed the certificate, myself, conveyed it to the registrar, got the order for burial, took, it round to the parish clerk, arranged an hour, then off to the, undertaker's, and back to my practice. It was a kind of nightmare, morning to look back upon, relieved only by the figure of my old, Bohemian, with his pea jacket, his black thorn, his puffy, crinkly face\\n\\nthat he should not say one word about his phenomenal success here--of, which I am naturally most anxious to hear--not a word either upon the, important subject of our partnership, but will think and talk of nothing, but this extraordinary naval idea. In a week he will have tossed it, aside in all probability, and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the, Jews and settling them in Madagascar. Yet from all he has said, and all, I have seen, there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way, made a tremendous hit, and to-morrow I shall let you know all about, it. Come what may, I am delighted that I came, for things promise to be, interesting. Regard this not as the end of a letter, but of a paragraph., You shall have the conclusion to-morrow, or on Thursday at the latest., Goodbye, and my remembrance to Lawrence if you see him. How's your, friend from Yale?\\n\\nOne day we went to the Central Hotel billiard-room in the evening to, play a match. Our form is just about the same, and we should have bad an, enjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his. He had, been in a sullen humour the whole day, pretending not to hear what, I said to him, or else giving snappy answers, and looking like a, thunder-cloud. I was determined not to have a row, so I took no notice, at all of his continual provocations, which, instead of pacifying him\\n\\nI think that I mentioned, when I gave you a short sketch of my dear old, mother, that she has a very high standard of family honour. She really, tries to live up to the Percy-Plantagenet blend which is said to flow, in our veins; and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her, from sailing through life, like the grande dame that she is, throwing, largesse to right and left, with her head in the air and her soul in the, clouds. I have often heard her say (and I am quite convinced that she, meant it) that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves, than know that we had committed a dishonourable action. Yes; for all her, softness and femininity, she could freeze iron-hard at the suspicion of, baseness; and I have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace, collar when she has heard of an act of meanness.\\n\\nThere was no need of three insertions. One would have been ample. Within, half an hour of the appearance of the first edition, I had an applicant, at the end of my bell-wire, and for the remainder of the evening Paul, was ushering them in and I interviewing them with hardly a break. I, should have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat;, but as we saw the demand increase, our conditions went up and up;, white aprons, proper dress for answering door, doing beds and boots\\n\\nHowever, I had not quite got to the end of Whitehall's visit yet. When, I went back I took down the beautiful lava jug, and inside I found his, card. On the back was written, \\\"You have gone into action, sir. It may, be your fate to sink or to swim, but it can never be your degradation, to strike. Die on the last plank and be damned to you, or come into port, with your ensign flying mast-high.\\\"\\n\\nI tell you this, Bertie, because if I put reason above emotion I would, not have you think that I am not open to attacks of the latter also., I feel that what I say about religion is too cold and academic. I feel, that there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting., But if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a, thing to be true, which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out, against, then you are selling your opiates too high. I'm a volunteer for, \\\"God's own forlorn hope,\\\" and I'll clamber up the breech as long as I, think I can see the flag of truth waving in front of me.\\n\\nthe man whom they were after, running at the top of his speed in their, direction. His little peculiarity had asserted itself, you see, and, he had unconsciously turned in his flight. They tripped him up, flung, themselves upon him, and after a long and desperate struggle dragged, him to the police station. He was charged before the magistrate next, morning, but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own, defence that he carried the Court with him, and escaped with a nominal, fine. At his invitation, the witnesses and the police trooped after, him to the nearest hotel, and the affair ended in universal, whisky-and-sodas.\\n\\na sitting-room, and a fourth room, which Cullingworth insisted upon, regarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease, though, I am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from, below which had given him the idea. At any rate, with his usual energy, he had not only locked the room up, but had gummed varnished paper over, all the cracks of the door, to prevent the imaginary contagion from, spreading. The furniture was the sparest possible. There were, I, remember, only two chairs in the sitting-room; so that when a guest came, (and I think I was the only one) Cullingworth used to squat upon a pile, of yearly volumes of the British Medical Journal in the corner. I can, see him now levering himself up from his lowly seat, and striding about, the room roaring and striking with his hands, while his little wife, sat mum in the corner, listening to him with love and admiration in her, eyes. What did we care, any one of the three of us, where we sat or how, we lived, when youth throbbed hot in our veins, and our souls were all, aflame with the possibilities of life? I still look upon those Bohemian, evenings, in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese, as being among, the happiest that I have known.\\n\\n\\\"If I'm to have any doctoring it must come from you, laddie,\\\" he said;, \\\"for if I was to turn my toes up in the public square, there's not a man, here who would do more than sign my certificate. By Crums, they might, get the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me, for, there's no love lost between us. But I want to go down to the practice, all the same.\\\"\\n\\nYou see, it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first, appearance in Birchespool was not in the dock of the police-court. I, should have had no one to answer for me, if I had been arrested, and, should have been put quite on a level with my adversary. I daresay you, think I made a great fool of myself, but I should like to know how, I could have acted otherwise. The only thing that I feel now is my, loneliness. What a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child!\\n\\nI was a frequent visitor to the Cullingworths, for the pleasure that I, got was made the sweeter by the pleasure which I hoped that I gave. They, knew no one, and desired to know no one; so that socially I seemed to be, the only link that bound them to the world. I even ventured to interfere, in the details of their little menage. Cullingworth had a fad at the, time, that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment, of the open-air life of our ancestors, and as a corollary he kept his, windows open day and night. As his wife was obviously fragile, and yet, would have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint, I, took it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she, suffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a, draught. He scowled savagely at me for my interference; and I thought, we were on the verge of a quarrel, but it blew over, and he became more, considerate in the matter of ventilation.\\n\\n, You write reproachfully, my dear Bertie, and you say that absence must, have weakened our close friendship, since I have not sent you a line, during this long seven months. The real truth of the matter is that, I had not the heart to write to you until I could tell you something, cheery; and something cheery has been terribly long in coming. At, present I can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at, the edges.\\n\\ntogether with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among, the ancient Londoners. Several examples of these metallic cylinders, or tubings were on exhibition in the hall, and were passed round for, inspection among the audience. The learned lecturer prefaced his remarks, by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which, separated them from the days when London was a flourishing city, it, behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might, come as to the habits of the inhabitants. Recent research appeared to, have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall, of London was somewhat later than that of the erection of the Egyptian, Pyramids. A large building had recently been unearthed near the dried-up, bed of the river Thames; and there could be no question from existing, records that this was the seat of the law-making council among the, ancient Britons--or Anglicans, as they were sometimes called. The, lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the Thames had been, tunnelled under by a monarch named Brunel, who is supposed by some, authorities to have succeeded Alfred the Great. The open spaces of, London, he went on to remark, must have been far from safe, as the, bones of lions, tigers, and other extinct forms of carnivora had, been discovered in the Regent's Park. Having briefly referred to the, mysterious structures known as 'pillar-boxes,' which are scattered, thickly over the city, and which are either religious in their origin\\n\\nAfter all, I see more and more clearly that both men and women are, incomplete, fragmentary, mutilated creatures, as long as they are, single. Do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is, the happiest, they are still full of vague unrests, of dim, ill-defined, dissatisfactions, of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts., Alone each is a half-made being, with every instinct and feeling, yearning for its missing moiety. Together they form a complete and, symmetrical whole, the minds of each strongest where that of the other, needs reinforcing. I often think that if our souls survive death (and I, believe they do, though I base my believe on very different grounds from, yours), every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined, with it, to round it off and give it symmetry. So thought the old, Mormon, you remember, who used it as an argument for his creed. \\\"You, cannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you,\\\" he said., \\\"But with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the, world to come.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that I must, tell you of it. Cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel, darts. With this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet, the, length of the back room. We were shooting at a mark after dinner, when, he asked me whether I would hold a halfpenny between my finger and, thumb, and allow him to shoot it out. A halfpenny not being forthcoming\\n\\nits dogmatism about what seems to be false, its conflict with what we, know to be true. We KNOW that man has ascended, not descended; so what, is the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition, of his fall? We KNOW that the world was not made in six days, that the, sun could never be stopped since it was never moving, and that no man, ever lived three days in a fish; so what becomes of the inspiration of a, book which contains such statements? \\\"Truth, though it crush me!\\\"\\n\\nThe room was a large bare one, at the end of a long corridor. Near the, door was seated a footman, placed there to fill up the gap between two, doctors, and looking considerably relieved at my advent. Over by the, window (which was furnished with a wooden guard, like that of a nursery), sat a tall, yellow-haired, yellow-bearded, young man, who raised a pair, of startled blue eyes as we entered. He was turning over the pages of a, bound copy of the Illustrated London News.\\n\\nI had enough to make a man serious before, when I had to face the world, without money or interest. But now to think of the mother and my sisters, and little Paul all leaning upon me when I cannot stand myself--it is, a nightmare. Could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have, those whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it?, But perhaps it won't come to that. Perhaps my father may hold his, own for years. Come what may, I am bound to think that all things are, ordered for the best; though when the good is a furlong off, and we with, our beetle eyes can only see three inches, it takes some confidence in, general principles to pull us through.\\n\\n\\\"Spring,\\\" \\\"The Banjo Player,\\\" and \\\"Windsor Castle,\\\" for five shillings;, a tiny fender, half-a-crown; a toilet set, five shillings; another, very small square-topped table, three and sixpence. Whenever I bid, for anything, Whitehall thrust his black-thorn up into the air, and, presently I found him doing so on my behalf when I had no intention of, buying. I narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a, stuffed macaw in a glass case.\\n\\nIt was about four in the afternoon when I reached Birchespool, which, is fifty-three miles by rail from Bradfield. It may be merely a name to, you, and, indeed, until I set foot in it I knew nothing of it myself;, but I can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and, thirty thousand souls (about the same as Bradfield), that it is mildly, manufacturing, that it is within an hour's journey of the sea, that it, has an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well, and that the, country round is exceedingly beautiful. It is small enough to have a, character of its own, and large enough for solitude, which is always the, great charm of a city, after the offensive publicity of the country.\\n\\nThis was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd. The folk, behind, wishing to see all that was going on, pushed against those in, front, until half-a-dozen of the foremost (with, I think, a woman among, them) were flung right up against us. One of these, a rough, sailor-like, fellow in a jersey, got wedged between us; and my antagonist, in his, blind rage, got one of his swinging blows home upon this new-comer's, ear. \\\"What, you----!\\\" yelled the sailor; and in an instant he had taken, over the whole contract, and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty., I grabbed my stick, which had fallen among the crowd, and backed my way, out, rather dishevelled, but very glad to get off so cheaply. From the, shouting which I could hear some time after I reached the door of my, lodgings, I gathered that a good battle was still raging.\\n\\nwe won't leave a doctor in it. It's all they can do now to get butter, to their bread; and when we get to work together they'll have to eat it, dry. Listen to me, my boy! There are a hundred and twenty thousand folk, in this town, all shrieking for advice, and there isn't a doctor who, knows a rhubarb pill from a calculus. Man, we only have to gather them, in. I stand and take the money until my arm aches.\\\"\\n\\nWell, when I had finished my empty-house-and-doctor chart, I found that, there was one villa to let, which undoubtedly was far the most suitable, for my purpose. In the first place it was fairly cheap-forty pounds, or, fifty with taxes. The front looked well. It had no garden. It stood with, the well-to-do quarter upon the one side, and the poorer upon the other., Finally, it was almost at the intersection of four roads, one of which, was a main artery of the town. Altogether, if I had ordered a house for, my purpose I could hardly have got anything better, and I was thrilled, with apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent. I, hurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather, startled the demure clerk inside.\\n\\nMy father took the news philosophically enough, with some rather, sardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep, each other company. But to my mother it was a flash of joy, followed by, a thunderclap of consternation. I had only three under-shirts, the, best of my linen had gone to Belfast to be refronted and recuffed, the, night-gowns were not marked yet--there were a dozen of those domestic, difficulties of which the mere male never thinks. A dreadful vision of, Lady Saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of, my socks obsessed my mother. Out we trudged together, and before evening, her soul was at rest, and I had mortgaged in advance my first month's, salary. She was great, as we walked home, upon the grand people into, whose service I was to enter. \\\"As a matter of fact, my dear,\\\" said she\\n\\nWe used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors; and, there we made a curious quartette: Jimmy (as he wished me to call him), glum and silent; I with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him;, Lady Saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins; and the, good-natured peer, fussy and genial, but always rather subdued in the, presence of his wife. She looked as if a glass of good wine would do, her good, and he as if he would be the better for abstinence; and so, in, accordance with the usual lopsidedness of life, he drank freely, and, she took nothing but lime-juice and water. You cannot imagine a more, ignorant, intolerant, narrow-minded woman than she. If she had only been, content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers, it would, not have mattered; but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating, clacking. What was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease, from one generation to another? She was bounded by insanity upon the, north and upon the south. I resolutely set myself to avoid all argument, with her; but she knew, with her woman's instinct, that we were as far, apart as the poles, and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before, me. One day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an, Episcopal church performing any service in a Presbyterian chapel. Some, neighbouring minister had done it, it seems; and if he had been marked, down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing., I suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue, for she, suddenly turned upon me with:\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, holding out a twitching hand., \\\"I compliment you, sir! You look fresh, ---- fresh, and me with a head, like a toy-shop. We had a pleasant, quiet evening, and I took nothing to, hurt, but it is the ---- relaxing air of this place that settles me. I, can't bear up against it. Last year it gave me the horrors, and I expect, it will again. You're off house-hunting, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\nand calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as, to his position. The good people were so touched by the picture that, he drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them, wept, and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their, bills stand over, but even some talk of a collection then and there to, help Cullingworth on his way. He has, I understand, left Avonmouth, but, no one has any idea what has become of him. It is generally supposed, that he has gone to England. He is a strange fellow, but I wish him luck, wherever he goes.\\n\\nI never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life. He used, language of self-reproach which would have been extravagant if he had, shot off one of my limbs. Our positions were absurdly reversed; and it, was he who sat collapsed in a chair, while it was I, with the dart, still in my finger, who leaned over him and laughed the matter off. Mrs., Cullingworth had run for hot water, and presently with a tweezers we, got the intruder out. There was very little pain (more to-day than, yesterday), but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may, look for a star at the end of my right forefinger.\\n\\nAnd then there came another and a more serious accident. This would be, about two months after the beginning, though already I find it hard to, put things in their due order. A lawyer in the town named Dickson was, riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him. I was, eating saveloys in the back room at the time, but I heard the noise and, rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in., They flooded into my house, thronged my hall, dirtied my consulting, room, and even pushed their way into my back room, which they found, elegantly furnished with a portmanteau, a lump of bread, and a cold, sausage.\\n\\nI had plenty of time on my way to Birchespool to reflect upon my, prospects and present situation. My baggage consisted of a large, brassplate, a small leather trunk, and a hat-box. The plate with my name, engraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head. In my box, were a stethoscope, several medical books, a second pair of boots, two, suits of clothes, my linen and my toilet things. With this, and the five, pounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse, I was sallying out, to clear standing-room, and win the right to live from my fellow-men., But at least there was some chance of permanency about this; and if, there was the promise of poverty and hardship, there was also that of, freedom. I should have no Lady Saltire to toss up her chin because I had, my own view of things, no Cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing. I, would be my own--my very own. I capered up and down the carriage at the, thought. After all, I had everything to gain and nothing in the whole, wide world to lose. And I had youth and strength and energy, and the, whole science of medicine packed in between my two ears. I felt as, exultant as though I were going to take over some practice which lay, ready for me.\\n\\nThe Cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return. There was, a singular look upon both their faces which seemed to ME to mean that, they were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me. When I think, of their absolute geniality a few days ago, and their markedly reserved, manner now, I can make no sense out of it. I asked Cullingworth point, blank what it meant, but he only turned it off with a forced laugh, and, some nonsense about my thin skin. I think that I am the last man in the, world to take offence where none is meant; but at any rate I determined, to end the matter by leaving Bradfield at once. It had struck me, during, my journey back from Stockwell, that Birchespool would be a good place;, so on the very next day I started off, taking my luggage with me, and, bidding a final good-bye to Cullingworth and his wife.\\n\\nWe were away for several weeks in the Isle of Man, and then came back, to Oakley Villa, where Miss Williams was awaiting us in a house in which, even my mother could have found no dust, and with a series of cheering, legends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my, absence. There really was a marked increase in my practice; and for the, last six months or so, without being actually busy, I have always had, enough to occupy me. My people are poor, and I have to work hard for a, small fee; but I still study and attend the local hospital, and keep my, knowledge up-to-date, so as to be ready for my opening when it comes., There are times when I chafe that I may not play a part upon some, larger stage than this; but my happiness is complete, and if fate has, no further use for me, I am content now from my heart to live and to die, where I am.\\n\\nTalking about horses, we had no end of a fuss here the other day., Cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a first-class riding, horse; and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him, he, commissioned a horse dealer to get him one. The man told us of a charger, which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of. He, did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was, because he considered it to be dangerous; but, he added, that Captain, Lucas had given L150 for it, and was prepared to sell it at seventy., This excited Cullingworth, and he ordered the creature to be saddled and, brought round. It was a beautiful animal, coal black, with a magnificent, neck and shoulders, but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears, and an, unpleasant way of looking at you. The horse dealer said that our yard, was too small to try the creature in; but Cullingworth clambered up upon, its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the, ears with the bone handle of his whip. Then ensued one of the most, lively ten minutes that I can remember. The beast justified his, reputation; but Cullingworth, although he was no horseman, stuck to him, like a limpet. Backwards, forwards, sideways, on his fore feet, on, his hind feet, with his back curved, with his back sunk, bucking and, kicking, there was nothing the creature did not try. Cullingworth was, sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail--never by, any chance in the saddle--he had lost both stirrups, and his knees were, drawn up and his heels dug into the creature's ribs, while his hands, clawed at mane, saddle, or ears, whichever he saw in front of him. He, kept his whip, however; and whenever the brute eased down, Cullingworth, lammed him once more with the bone handle. His idea, I suppose, was to, break its spirit, but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry, through. The animal bunched his four feet together, ducked down his, head, arched his back like a yawning cat, and gave three convulsive, springs into the air. At the first, Cullingworth's knees were above the, saddle flaps, at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive, grip, at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling, narrowly, missed the coping of the wall, broke with his head the iron bar which, held some wire netting, and toppled back with a thud into the yard. Up, he bounded with the blood streaming down his face, and running into our, half-finished stables he seized a hatchet, and with a bellow of, rage rushed at the horse. I caught him by the coat and put on a, fourteen-stone drag, while the horse dealer (who was as white as a, cheese) ran off with his horse into the street. Cullingworth broke away, from my grip, and cursing incoherently, his face slobbered with blood\\n\\nBut how do I know what is truth, you ask? I don't. But I know, particularly well what isn't. And surely that is something to have, gained. It isn't true that the great central Mind that planned all, things is capable of jealousy or of revenge, or of cruelty or of, injustice. These are human attributes; and the book which ascribes, them to the Infinite must be human also. It isn't true that the laws of, Nature have been capriciously disturbed, that snakes have talked, that, women have been turned to salt, that rods have brought water out of, rocks. You must in honesty confess that if these things were presented, to us when we were, adults for the first time, we should smile at them., It isn't true that the Fountain of all common sense should punish a race, for a venial offence committed by a person long since dead, and then, should add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon, a single innocent scapegoat. Can you not see all the want of justice, and logic, to say nothing of the want of mercy, involved in such a, conception? Can you not see it, Bertie? How can you blind yourself to, it! Take your eyes away from the details for a moment, and look at this, root idea of the predominant Faith. Is the general conception of it, consistent with infinite wisdom and mercy? If not, what becomes of the, dogmas, the sacraments, the whole scheme which is founded upon this, sand-bank? Courage, my friend! At the right moment all will be laid, aside, as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which, has been a good friend to him in his weakness. But his changes won't be, over then. His hobble will become a walk, and his walk a run. There is, no finality--CAN be none since the question concerns the infinite. All, this, which appears too advanced to you to-day, will seem reactionary, and conservative a thousand years hence.\\n\\nWhen I woke in the morning, and looked round at the bare walls and the, basin on the packing case, I hardly knew where I was. Cullingworth came, charging into the room in his dressing gown, however, and roused me, effectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed, and, throwing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow, with a thud. He was in great spirits, and, squatting on the bed, he held, forth about his plans while I dressed.\\n\\nand I spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to, celebrate the occasion. Old Cullingworth has always had a very high, opinion of lunatics for beginners. \\\"Get a lunatic, my boy! Get a, lunatic!\\\" he used to say. Then it was not only the situation, but the, fine connection that it opened up. I seemed to see exactly what would, happen. There would be illness in the family,--Lord Saltire himself, perhaps, or his wife. There would be no time to send for advice. I would, be consulted. I would gain their confidence and become their family, attendant. They would recommend me to their wealthy friends. It was all, as clear as possible. I was debating before I reached home whether it, would be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order, to take the Professorship which might be offered me.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" said I. \\\"If you are so anxious to make a business matter, of it, you can arrange it so.\\\" I could not make out, and cannot make out, now, what had happened to freeze them up so; but I supposed that they, had been talking it over, and came to the conclusion that I was settling, down too much upon the old lines, and that they must remind me that I, was under orders to quit. They might have done it with more tact.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the more human traits--'weak' is hardly the word I should have, used. His rebuke of the Sabbatarians, His personal violence to the, hucksters, His outbursts against the Pharisees, His rather unreasoning, petulance against the fig-tree because it bore no fruit at the wrong, season of the year, His very human feeling towards the housewife who, bustled about when He was talking, his gratification that the ointment, should have been used for Him instead of being devoted to the poor\\n\\nI have told you this trivial little scene, Bertie, to show the strange, way in which Cullingworth springs quarrels upon me; suddenly, without, the slightest possible provocation, taking a most offensive tone, and, then when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance, turning, the whole thing to chaff. This has occurred again and again recently;, and, when coupled with the change in Mrs. Cullingworth's demeanour\\n\\nAs to old Cullingworth, he is booming along as merrily as ever. You say, in your last, that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of, the public in so short a time. That is just the point which I have found, it hard to get light upon. He told me that after his first coming he had, not a patient for a month, and that he was so disheartened that he very, nearly made a moonlight exodus. At last, however, a few cases came his, way--and he made such extraordinary cures of them, or else impressed, them so by his eccentricity, that they would do nothing but talk of him., Some of his wonderful results got into the local press, though, after, my Avonmouth experience, I should not like to guarantee that he did not, himself convey them there. He showed me an almanac, which had a great, circulation in the district.\\n\\nBut--there is a great big \\\"but\\\" in the case. You must ride yourself on, the curb the whole time. Unless you are sure--absolutely sure--that you, can do this, you are far best at home. You must never for one instant, forget yourself. You must remember what your object is in being there., You must inspire respect. Be friendly, genial, convivial--what you, will--but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman. If you can make, yourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that, you join a fresh introduction to practice. But beware of drink! Above, everything, beware of drink! The company that you are in may condone, it in each other, but never in the man who wishes them to commit their, lives to his safe keeping. A slip is fatal--a half slip perilous. Make, your rule of life and go by it, in spite of challenge or coaxers. It, will be remembered in your favour next morning.\\n\\nWhen first I came out of the faith in which I had been reared, I, certainly did feel for a time as if my life-belt had burst. I won't, exaggerate and say that I was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual, darkness. Youth is too full of action for that. But I was conscious of a, vague unrest, of a constant want of repose, of an emptiness and hardness, which I had not noticed in life before. I had so identified religion, with the Bible that I could not conceive them apart. When the foundation, proved false, the whole structure came rattling about my ears. And then, good old Carlyle came to the rescue; and partly from him, and partly, from my own broodings, I made a little hut of my own, which has kept me, snug ever since, and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides.\\n\\nfull of every lofty aspiration, and that a gross physical cause, such, as the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on, to the surface of the membrane which covers his brain, may have the, ultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every, bestial attribute! That a man's individuality should swing round, from pole to pole, and yet that one life should contain these two, contradictory personalities--is it not a wondrous thing?\\n\\nSmeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some, one is conspiring to poison him with copper, against which he takes the, most extravagant precautions. It is the strangest sight, he says, to, see Cullingworth at his meals; for he sits with an elaborate chemical, apparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow, with which he, tests samples of every course. I could not help laughing at Smeaton's, description, and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it. Of all, ruins, that of a fine man is the saddest.\\n\\ncooking,--we became more and more exacting. So at last we made our, selection; a Miss Wotton, who asked leave to bring her sister with her., She was a hard-faced brusque-mannered person, whose appearance in a, bachelor's household was not likely to cause a scandal. Her nose was in, itself a certificate of virtue. She was to bring her furniture into, the basement, and I was to give her and her sister one of the two upper, rooms for a bedroom.\\n\\nFrom that I turned to the most important point of all--the arrangement, of my consulting room. My experience with Cullingworth had taught me, one thing at least,--that patients care nothing about your house if they, only think that you can cure them. Once get that idea into their, heads, and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your, prescriptions on the manger. Still, as this was, for many a day to, come, to be the only furnished room in my house, it was worth a little, planning to get it set out to the best advantage.\\n\\n, I am writing this, my dear Bertie, at a little table which has been, fitted up in the window of my bedroom. Every one in the house is asleep, except myself; and all the noise of the city is hushed. Yet my own brain, is singularly active, and I feel that I am better employed in sitting, up and writing to you, than in tossing about upon my bed. I am often, accused of being sleepy in the daytime, but every now and then Nature, gets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night.\\n\\nI was supposed to have my eye upon him all day, with a two-hour interval, every afternoon and an evening to myself upon Fridays. But then what was, the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near, and I had, no friends whom I could visit? I did a fair amount of reading, for Lord, Saltire let me have the run of his library. Gibbon gave me a couple of, enchanting weeks. You know the effect that he produces. You seem to, be serenely floating upon a cloud, and looking down on all these pigmy, armies and navies, with a wise Mentor ever at your side to whisper to, you the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama.\\n\\nas we wonder to-day. I suppose that we DO know a little more than they., We have an arc of about three thousand years given us, from which to, calculate out the course to be described by our descendants; but that, arc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which Providence uses in, working out its designs that our deductions from it must, I think, be, uncertain. Will civilisation be swamped by barbarism? It happened once, before, because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of, darkness. But what, for example, could break down the great country in, which you dwell? No, our civilisation will endure and grow more complex., Man will live in the air and below the water. Preventive medicine will, develop until old age shall become the sole cause of death. Education, and a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime. The, English-speaking races will unite, with their centre in the United, States. Gradually the European States will follow their example. War, will become rare, but more terrible. The forms of religion will be, abandoned, but the essence will be maintained; so that one universal, creed will embrace the whole civilised earth, which will preach trust, in that central power, which will be as unknown then as now. That's my, horoscope, and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking. But, Bertie Swanborough and Stark Munro will be blowing about on the west, wind, and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half, of it has come to pass.\\n\\nI sat in my house all day, with that ever-present sense of privacy and, novelty which had thrilled me when I first shut the street door behind, me. At evening I sallied out and bought a loaf of bread, half a pound, of tea (\\\"sweepings,\\\" they call it, and it cost eightpence), a tin, kettle (fivepence), a pound of sugar, a tin of Swiss milk, and a tin, of American potted meat. I had often heard my mother groan over the, expenses of housekeeping, and now I began to understand what she meant., Two and ninepence went like a flash, but at least I had enough to keep, myself going for some days.\\n\\nwhich has been deepening from day to day. Well, it seemed to reach a, climax this morning, and on our way to the rooms I could hardly get a, word out of him. The place was fairly crowded with patients, but my, own share was rather below the average. When I had finished I added a, chapter to my novel, and waited until he and his wife were ready for the, daily bag-carrying homewards.\\n\\nThat evening, and for many evenings to come, we worked upon our liver., For our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat, in an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the, non-nitrogenous waxy matter. With our limited appliances the only way, we could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying, pan. So night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of, a beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in, making these grim fricassees. Nothing came of all our work; for though, Cullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case, and, wrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject, he was never, apt at stating his views with his pen, and he left, I am sure, a very, confused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was, driving at. Again, as he was a mere student without any letters after, his name, he got scant attention, and I never heard that he gained over, a single supporter.\\n\\nNow and again young Derwent introduced some excitement into my dull, life. On one occasion when we were walking in the grounds, he suddenly, snatched up a spade from a grass-plot, and rushed at an inoffensive, under-gardener. The man ran screaming for his life, with my patient, cursing at his very heels, and me within a few paces of him. When I at, last laid my hand on his collar, he threw down his weapon and burst into, shrieks of laughter. It was only mischief and not ferocity; but when, that under-gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like, a cream cheese. At night the attendant slept in a camp-bed at the foot, of the patient's, and my room was next door, so that I could be called, if necessary. No, it was not a very exhilarating life!\\n\\nand I hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and, theologians: \\\"our gross frames\\\" and \\\"our miserable mortal clay\\\" are, phrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety. It, is no compliment to the Creator to depreciate His handiwork. Whatever, theory or belief we may hold about the soul, there can, I suppose, be, no doubt that the body is immortal. Matter may be transformed (in which, case it may be re-transformed), but it can never be destroyed. If, a comet were to strike this globule of ours, and to knock it into a, billion fragments, which were splashed all over the solar system--if, its fiery breath were to lick up the earth's surface until it was peeled, like an orange, still at the end of a hundred millions of years, every tiniest particle of our bodies would exist--in other forms and, combinations, it is true, but still those very atoms which now form the, forefinger which traces these words. So the child with the same wooden, bricks will build a wall, then strew them on the table; then a tower\\n\\nIt wasn't a pretty sight. A woman, pinched and bedraggled, with a baby, on her arm, was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom I, judged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her. He was, one of those red-faced, dark-eyed men who can look peculiarly malignant, when they choose. It was clear that he was half mad with drink, and that, she had been trying to lure him away from some den. I was just in time, to see him take a flying kick at her, amid cries of \\\"Shame!\\\" from the, crowd, and then lurch forward again, with the evident intention of, having another, the mob still expostulating vaguely.\\n\\nThis pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes., I remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent, London specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row, who, amused himself by interjecting remarks. The lecturer appealed to his, audience at last. \\\"These interruptions are insufferable, gentlemen,\\\", said he; \\\"will no one free me from this annoyance?\\\" \\\"Hold your, tongue--you, sir, on the front bench,\\\" cried Cullingworth, in his, bull's bellow. \\\"Perhaps you'll make me,\\\" said the fellow, turning a, contemptuous face over his shoulder. Cullingworth closed his note-book\\n\\n, He was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity. You, cannot imagine a more savage-looking creature than Cullingworth is when, his temper goes wrong. He gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his, light blue eyes, and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra. He, isn't a beauty at his best, but at his worst he's really phenomenal. At, the first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room.\\n\\n\\\"You will permit me, Dr. Munro, sir, to place this trifle in your room., It's lava, sir; lava from Vesuvius, and made in Naples. By ----, you may, think its empty, Dr. Munro, sir, but it is full of my best wishes; and, when you've got the best practice in this town you may point to that, vase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport, who, backed you from the start.\\\"\\n\\nI had the kindest of leave takings from Horton. If he had been my, brother he could not have been more affectionate. I could not have, thought that I should grow so fond of a man in so short a time. He, takes the keenest interest in my venture, and I am to write him a full, account. He gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had, coloured himself--the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker., It was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at Bradfield, I, had a little harbour at Merton for which I could make. Still, of course\\n\\nmakes a most substantial meal. Butter I have discarded for the present., My actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day, but I am a, patron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day, which I, expend upon an evening paper; for with events hurrying on like this in, Alexandria, I cannot bear to be without the news. Still I often reproach, myself with that halfpenny, for if I went out in the evening and looked, at the placards I might save it, and yet have a general idea of what is, going on. Of course, a halfpenny a night sounds nothing, but think of a, shilling a month! Perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on, this diet! I am thin, it is true, but I never felt more fit in my life., So full of energy am I that I start off sometimes at ten at night and, walk hard until two or three in the morning. I dare not go out during, the day, you see, for fear that I should miss a patient. I have asked my, mother not to send little Paul down yet until I see my way more clearly.\\n\\nThen there are other cures which depend, I think, upon his own personal, magnetism. He is so robust and loud-voiced and hearty that a weak, nervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality. He is so, perfectly confident that he can cure them, that he makes them perfectly, confident that they can be cured; and you know how in nervous cases the, mind reacts upon the body. If he chose to preserve crutches and sticks\\n\\nThere was one other incident, however. One day after I had been in, practice about two months, I observed a bearded commonplace-looking, person lounging about on the other side of the road. In the afternoon he, was again visible from my consulting-room window. When I saw him there, once more next morning, my suspicions were aroused, and they became, certainties when, a day or so afterwards, I came out of a patient's, house in a poor street, and saw the same fellow looking into a, greengrocer's shop upon the other side. I walked to the end of the, street, waited round the corner, and met him as he came hurrying after.\\n\\nHowever, she took it most admirably. They were all three at breakfast, when I came round, the general, Mrs. La Force, and the daughter. Somehow, they seemed to know all that I had to say at the very sight of me; and, in their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me, for the, shock I had suffered, and the disturbance of my household. I found, myself turned from the consoler into the consoled. For an hour or more, we talked it over, I explaining what I hope needed no explanation, that, as the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to, know how immediate was his danger. There can be no doubt that the fall, of temperature and the quietness which both Porter and I had looked upon, as a hopeful sign, were really the beginning to the end.\\n\\nthere's order! And where there is order there must be mind, and where, there is mind there must be sense of Justice. I don't allow that there, can be any doubt as to the existence of that central Mind, or as to the, possession by it of certain attributes. The stars help me to realise, these. It is strange, when one looks upon them, to think that the, Churches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether, the Almighty is most gratified by our emptying a tea-spoonful of water, over our babies' heads, or by our waiting a few years and then plunging, them bodily into a tank. It would be comic if it were not so tragic.\\n\\nimmediately after my breach with Cullingworth. It's rather hard to know, where to begin when one has so many events to narrate, disconnected from, each other, and trivial in themselves, yet which have each loomed large, as I came upon them, though they look small enough now that they are so, far astern. As I have mentioned Cullingworth, I may as well say first, the little that is to be said about him. I answered his letter in the, way which I have, I think, already described. I hardly expected to hear, from him again; but my note had evidently stung him, and I had a, brusque message in which he said that if I wished him to believe in my, \\\"bona-fides\\\" (whatever he may have meant by that), I would return the, money which I had had during the time that I was with him at Bradfield., To this I replied that the sum was about twelve pounds; that I still, retained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds, if I came to Bradfield, that the balance in my favour was two hundred, and eighty-eight pounds; and that unless I had a cheque by return, I, should put the matter into the hands of my solicitor. This put a final, end to our correspondence.\\n\\nWhen the supper was finished, Cullingworth led the way into a small, sitting-room, where we both lit our pipes, and Mrs. Cullingworth her, cigarette. He sat for some little time in silence, and then bounding up, rushed to the door and flung it open. It is always one of his strange, peculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring, against him; for, in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness\\n\\npull up your socks!\\\" I should have been less surprised. And then, suddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind, and I rushed to, the cellar. The cask was tilted forward on the trestles. I struck it and, it boomed like a drum. I turned the tap, and not one drop appeared. Let, us draw a veil over the painful scene. Suffice it that Mrs. Wotton got, her marching orders then and there--and that next day Paul and I found, ourselves alone in the empty house once more.\\n\\nBut in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the, beginning of my stay with him, for my mother's letters stigmatising his, conduct had begun very early. For some time he had been uncertain how, to proceed. Then he had invented the excuse (which seemed to me at the, time, if you remember, to be quite inadequate) about the slight weekly, decline in the practice in order to get me out of it. His next move, was to persuade me to start for myself; and as this would be impossible, without money, he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small, weekly loan. I remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about, ordering furniture and other things, because tradesmen gave long credit, to beginners, and I could always fall back upon him if necessary. He, knew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at, least a year's tenancy. Then he waited to spring his mine until I had, written to say that I had finally committed myself, on which by return, of post came his letter breaking the connection. It was so long and so, elaborate a course of deceit, that I for the first time felt something, like fear as I thought of Cullingworth. It was as though in the, guise and dress of a man I had caught a sudden glimpse of something, sub-human--of something so outside my own range of thought that I was, powerless against it.\\n\\nIt was only when I went to my bedroom that I realised the oversights, which I had made in my furnishing. There was no mattress and no pillow, or bed-clothes. My mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the, practice, that I had never given a thought to my own private wants. I, slept that night upon the irons of my bed, and rose up like St. Lawrence, from the gridiron. My second suit of clothes with Bristowe's \\\"Principles, of Medicine\\\" made an excellent pillow, while on a warm June night a, man can do well wrapped in his overcoat. I had no fancy for second-hand, bed-clothes, and determined until I could buy some new ones, to make, myself a straw pillow, and to put on both my suits of clothes on the, colder nights. Two days later, however, the problem was solved in more, luxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother\\n\\nso that Lady Teazle or Mrs. Sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan, chair without soiling her dainty satin shoes. It brings home to me what, an unstable chemical compound man is. Here are the stage accessories, as good as ever, while the players have all split up into hydrogen, and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, with traces of iron and silica and, phosphorus. A tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water,--there, is the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair! It's a curious double, picture, if one could but conjure it up. On the one side, the high-born, bucks, the mincing ladies, the scheming courtiers, pushing and planning\\n\\n\\\"Of course, you see that the whole thing is to scale. My warship of the, future carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much, larger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet., Or I might have a separate raft, possibly, to carry my apparatus. My, ship goes into action. What happens then, Munro? Eh, what! Every shot, fired at her goes smack on to the magnet. There's a reservoir below into, which they drop when the electric circuit is broken. After every action, they are sold by auction for old metal, and the result divided as prize, money among the crew. But think of it, man! I tell you it is an absolute, impossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my, apparatus. And then look at the cheapness. You don't want armour. You, want nothing. Any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of, these. The war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound, ten. You're grinning again; but if you give me a magnet and a Brixton, trawler with a seven-pounder gun I'll show sport to the finest, battle-ship afloat.\\\"\\n\\nOf course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the, question. I could not feed one, far less pay one, and I had no kitchen, furniture. I must open my door to my own patients--let them think what, they would of it. I must clean my own plate and brush down my own front;, and these duties must be thoroughly done, come what might, for I must, show a presentable outside to the public. Well, there was no great, hardship in that, for I could do it under the cover of night. But I had, had a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely. She, had written to say that if I wished she would send my little brother, Paul to keep me company. I wrote back eagerly to agree. He was a hardy, cheery little fellow of nine, who would, I knew, gladly share hard times, with me; while, if they became unduly so, I could always have him taken, home again. Some weeks must pass before he could come, but it cheered me, to think of him. Apart from his company, there were a thousand ways in, which he might be useful.\\n\\nPoor chap, he had little enough to be cheery over either. He was an old, soldier who had lost a good many teeth, but who had continued to find, room between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe. Lately there, appeared a small sore on his nose which had spread, and become crusted., On feeling it I found it as hard as a streak of glue, with constant, darting pains passing through it. Of course, there could be no question, as to diagnosis. It was epitheliomatous cancer, caused by the irritation, of the hot tobacco smoke. I sent him back to his village, and two days, after I drove over in Cullingworth's dog-cart, and removed the growth. I, only got a sovereign for it. But it may be a nucleus for cases. The, old fellow did most admirably, and he has just been in (with a most, aristocratic curl to his nostrils) to tell me that he has bought a box, full of churchwardens. It was my first operation, and I daresay I was, more nervous about it than my patient, but the result has given me, confidence. I have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me. Come, what may, I am prepared to do it. Why should a man wait? Of course\\n\\nhowever, that at its best it is not worth more than L700 a year, with no, room for expansion. This is not large enough to keep two of us at work., Then, again, there are times when I can see that my religious opinions, annoy the dear old man. On the whole, and for every reason, I think, that it would be better if I were out of this. I applied for several, steamship lines, and for at least a dozen house surgeonships; but there, is as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as, if it were the Viceroyship of India. As a rule, I simply get my, testimonials returned without any comment, which is the sort of thing, that teaches a man humility. Of course, it is very pleasant to live with, the mater, and my little brother Paul is a regular trump. I am teaching, him boxing; and you should see him put his tiny fists up, and counter, with his right. He got me under the jaw this evening, and I had to ask, for poached eggs for supper.\\n\\nI wrote to you last on the night that I reached here. Next morning I set, to work upon my task. You would be surprised (at least I was) to see, how practical and methodical I can be. First of all I walked down to the, post-office and I bought a large shilling map of the town. Then back I, came and pinned this out upon the lodging-house table. This done, I set, to work to study it, and to arrange a series of walks by which I should, pass through every street of the place. You have no idea what that means, until you try to do it. I used to have breakfast, get out about ten\\n\\nIt was a newspaper cutting, which gave the true account of the incident., Suffice it that it was an ice accident, and that Cullingworth had really, behaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible, with, the child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered, his senses that they were able to separate them. I had hardly finished, reading it when we heard his step on the stairs; and she, thrusting, the paper back into her bosom, became in an instant the same silently, watchful woman as ever.\\n\\nwhich might no doubt involve some technical impossibility, but which, would at least be quite plausible and new. Then as he drew, his, bristling eyebrows would contract, his small eyes would gleam with, excitement, his lips would be pressed together, and he would end by, banging on the paper with his open hand, and shouting in his exultation., You would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes., But next instant, if you were to express surprise as to how it was that, the Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids, out, would come the pencil and envelope, and he would propound a scheme for, doing that with equal energy and conviction. This ingenuity was joined, to an extremely sanguine nature. As he paced up and down in his jerky, quick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention, he would, take out patents for it, receive you as his partner in the enterprise\\n\\n, I was so delighted, my dear chap, to have your assurance that nothing, that I have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend, you. It is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved I was at your, cordial letter. I have no one to whom I can talk upon such matters. I, am all driven inwards, and thought turns sour when one lets it, stagnate like that. It is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a, sympathetic listener--and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all, from another standpoint. It steadies and sobers one.\\n\\n\\\"By ----, Dr. Munro, sir,\\\" said he, \\\"I've asked every ---- man in, Birchespool that's got anything the matter with him. You'll have the, lot as patients within a week. There's Fraser, who's got a touch of, Martell's three star. He's coming. And there's Saunders, who talks about, nothing but his spleen. I'm sick of his ---- spleen! But I asked him., And there's Turpey's wound! This wet weather sets it tingling, and his, own surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline. He'll be there. And, there's Carr, who is drinking himself to death. He has not much for the, doctors, but what there is you may as well have.\\\"\\n\\nHis carriage was waiting, and we drove out to his residence, The, Myrtles, where I was speedily introduced both to his family and his, practice. The former is small, and the latter enormous. The wife is, dead; but her mother, Mrs. White, keeps house for him; and there are two, dear little girls, about five and seven. Then there is an unqualified, assistant, a young Irish student, who, with the three maids, the, coachman, and the stable boy, make up the whole establishment. When I, tell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do, you will, have an idea of the ground we cover.\\n\\nBut then our individuality? I often wonder whether something of that, wilt cling to our atoms--whether the dust of Johnnie Munro will ever, have something of him about it, and be separable from that of Bertie, Swanborough. I think it is possible that we DO impress ourselves upon, the units of our own structure. There are facts which tend to show that, every tiny organic cell of which a man is composed, contains in its, microcosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a, part. The ovum itself from which we are all produced is, as you know\\n\\n\\\"Let us see!\\\" says she, looking at the slate. \\\"He will be clear at seven, minutes past eight this evening. Yes, he could just manage it then. He, has no one at all from seven past to the quarter past\\\"--and so at the, appointed hour I have my patient precipitating himself into my room with, the demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a, railway station. If he knew that he is probably the only patient who has, opened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry--or think so, much of my advice.\\n\\n\\\"That's it,\\\" he shouted, stabbing at me with the amber. \\\"Naval supremacy, and command of the seas. It's all here right under your nose. I tell, you, Munro, I could go to Switzerland to-morrow, and I could say to, them--'Look here, you haven't got a seaboard and you haven't got a port;, but just find me a ship, and hoist your flag on it, and I'll give you, every ocean under heaven.' I'd sweep the seas until there wasn't a, match-box floating on them. Or I could make them over to a limited, company, and join the board after allotment. I hold the salt water in, the cup of this hand, every drop of it.\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed again in the most good-humoured way, and, as soon as, the young fellow had recovered, we all joined in quite a confidential, conversation. It is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities, of life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette. In half an hour we knew, all about each other, or at any rate I knew all about them. Mrs. La, Force was the mother's name, a widow with these two children. They had, given up housekeeping, and found it more pleasant to live in apartments\\n\\n\\\"I take a cursed interest in the whole thing. You may think it a ----, impertinence, but that's the way I'm made. As long as I can steam I'll, throw a rope to whoever wants a tow. I'll tell you what I'll do, Dr., Munro, sir. I'll stand on one tack if you'll stand on the other, and, I'll let you know if I come across anything that will do.\\\"\\n\\nThis train of thought is the after-swell from an argument with, Cullingworth this evening. He holds that the human race is deteriorating, mentally and morally. He calls out at the grossness which confounds the, Creator with a young Jewish Philosopher. I tried to show him that this, is no proof of degeneration, since the Jewish Philosopher at least, represented a moral idea, and was therefore on an infinitely higher, plane than the sensual divinities of the ancients. His own views of the, Creator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration. He declares, that looking round at Nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and, brutality. \\\"Either the Creator is not all-powerful, or else He is not, all-good,\\\" says he. \\\"Either He can stop these atrocities and won't, in, which case He is not all-good; or else He would stop them but can't, in, which case He is not all-powerful.\\\" It was a difficult dilemma for a man, who professes to stick to reason to get out of. Of course, if you plead, faith, you can always slip out of anything. I was forced to get behind, a corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own, thrusts. I said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted, that that which seemed evil really was EVIL. \\\"It lies with you to prove, that it isn't,\\\" said he. \\\"We may hope that it isn't,\\\" said I. \\\"Wait, until some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the, stomach,\\\" said he; and he shouted it out again every time I tried to, renew the argument.\\n\\nand I was going to leave Cullingworth at once. Then within a couple, of posts I had to write again and announce that my departure was, indefinitely postponed, and that I was actually doing his whole, practice. Well, the dear old lady was very angry. I don't suppose she, quite understood how temporary the necessity was, and how impossible it, would have been to leave Cullingworth in the lurch. She was silent for, nearly three weeks, and then she wrote a very stinging letter (and she, handles her adjectives most deftly when she likes). She went so far, as to say that Cullingworth was a \\\"bankrupt swindler,\\\" and that I had, dragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association, with him. This letter came on the morning of the very last day that my, patient was confined to the house. When I returned from work I found him, sitting in his dressing-gown downstairs. His wife, who had driven home\\n\\nIn the morning I went round to Mrs. La Force and gave her a bulletin., Her brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left., He had the Victoria Cross it seems, and was one of the desperate little, garrison who held Lucknow in that hell-whirl of a mutiny. And now the, sudden opening of a door sets him shaking, and a dropped tongs gives him, palpitations. Are we not the strangest kind of beings?\\n\\nWell, matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up, to the Dad saying that Mrs. Andrews' servant was ill, and would he come, at once. The old man had a touch of gout, so I donned my professional, coat and sallied forth, thinking that perhaps I might combine pleasure, with business, and have a few words with Laura. Sure enough, as I passed, up the gravel drive which curves round to the door, I glanced through, the drawing-room window, and saw her sitting painting, with her back, to the light. It was clear that she had not heard me. The hall door was, ajar, and when I pushed it open, no one was in the hall. A sudden fit, of roguishness came over me. I pushed the drawing-room door very slowly, wider, crept in on tiptoe, stole quietly across, and bending down, I, kissed the artist upon the nape of her neck. She turned round with a, squeal, and it was the mother!\\n\\nwhich was as extraordinary as everything else he did. I won't tell it, to you here, my dear Bertie, for I feel that I have dived down too many, side streets already; but it was a most bustling business, in which the, locking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of Cullingworth's, hair played prominent parts. Apropos of the latter he was never quite, able to get rid of its traces; and from this time forward there was, added to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight, struck upon his hair at certain angles, it turned it all iridescent and, shimmering.\\n\\nWe had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both, of us, without, however, any allusion to our past quarrel. He would, not admit that he had left Bradfield on account of a falling-off in his, practice, or for any reason except that he found the place too small., His spring-screen invention had, he said, been favourably reported upon, by one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the Clyde, and there, was every probability of their adopting it.\\n\\n\\\"Why the devil should we do all the good, Munro?\\\" he shouts. \\\"Eh, what? A, butcher would do good to the race, would he not, if he served his chops, out gratis through the window? He'd be a real benefactor; but he goes, on selling them at a shilling the pound for all that. Take the case of, a doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science. He flushes out drains\\n\\nAnd then the more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance, not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound, interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been, accumulated since the dawning of time. Some eighty thousand years are, supposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man. Yet, in all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of, chipping them. But within our father's lives what changes have there not, been? The railway and the telegraph, chloroform and applied electricity., Ten years now go further than a thousand then, not so much on account, of our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to, more. Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain, footsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal.\\n\\nWe filed off once more, he leading with the huge brass \\\"Dr. Munro\\\", under his arm; then the little woman, and then this rather perturbed, and bemuddled young man. He and his wife sat on the deal table in the, consulting room, like a hawk and a turtle-dove on the same perch, while, I leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets. Nothing, could be more prosaic and informal; but I knew very well that I was at a, crisis of my life. Before, it was only a choosing between two roads. Now, my main track had run suddenly to nothing, and I must go back or find a, bye-path.\\n\\nAm I not the slowest of story-tellers? But you encourage me to it by, your sympathetic interest in details. However, I shall move along a, little faster now. Next morning I was off to Lochtully, which, as you, know, is in the north of Perthshire. It stands three miles from the, station, a great gray pinnacled house, with two towers cocking out above, the fir woods, like a hare's ears from a tussock of grass. As we drove, up to the door I felt pretty solemn--not at all as the main line should, do when it condescends to visit the cadet branch. Into the hall as I, entered came a grave learned-looking man, with whom in my nervousness, I was about to shake hands cordially. Fortunately he forestalled the, impending embrace by explaining that he was the butler. He showed, me into a small study, where everything stank of varnish and morocco, leather, there to await the great man. He proved when he came to be a, much less formidable figure than his retainer--indeed, I felt thoroughly, at my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth. He is grizzled\\n\\nSo those were the last words of Cullingworth, and the last that I may, ever see of him also, for he starts almost immediately upon his strange, venture. He must succeed. He is a man whom nothing could hold down. I, wish him luck, and have a kindly feeling towards him, and yet I distrust, him from the bottom of my heart, and shall be just as pleased to know, that the Atlantic rolls between us.\\n\\nThey moved in a few days later. I was out at the time, and the first, intimation I had was finding three little dogs in my hall when I, returned. I had her up, and explained that this was a breach of, contract, and that I had no thoughts of running a menagerie. She pleaded, very hard for her little dogs, which it seems are a mother and two, daughters of some rare breed; so I at last gave in on the point., The other sister appeared to lead a subterranean troglodytic sort of, existence; for, though I caught a glimpse of her whisking round the, corner at times, it was a good month before I could have sworn to her in, a police court.\"\n        ],\n
