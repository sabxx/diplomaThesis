The hawk darted at him fiercely, and pecked at him, to draw his attention from her, and he stepped back, yet he continued, taking fatal draughts from the magic cup of her beauty.  Then the hawk, screamed a loud scream of anguish, and the Princess awoke, and started, half-way from the couch, and stared about her, and saw the bird in, agitation.  As she looked at the bird a shudder passed over her, and she, snatched a veil and drew it over her face, murmuring, 'I dream, or I am, under the eye of a man.'  Then she felt beneath the pillow, and knew that, the cockle-shell had been touched; and in a moment she leapt from her, couch, and ran to a mirror and saw herself as she was, a full-moon made, to snare the wariest and sit singly high on a throne in the hearts of, men.  At the sight of her beauty she smiled and seemed at peace\\n\\nThen said Shibli Bagarag, 'For this I praise Noorna bin Noorka, daughter, of Feshnavat, Vizier of the King that ruleth in the city of Shagpat!  She, saw me, that I was marked for greatness.  Wullahy, the eagle knoweth me, from afar, and proclaimeth me; the antelope of the hills scenteth the, coming of one not as other men, and telleth his tidings; the wind of the, desert shapeth its gust to a meaning, so that the stranger may wot Shibli, Bagarag is at hand!'\\n\\nThen he thought, ''Twere nevertheless well to do as the fountain, directeth, and question men while I see them.'  And he walked about among, the people, and came to the quays of the harbour where the ships lay, close in, many of them an easy leap from shore, and considered whom to, address.  So, as he loitered about the quays, meditating on the means at, the disposal of the All-Wise, and marking the vessels wistfully, behold\\n\\nThe Ass sniffed, turning to the four quarters, and chose a certain, direction, and bore them swiftly over hills and streans eddying in, silver; over huge mounds of sand, where the tents of Bedouins stood in, white clusters; over lakes smooth as the cheeks of sleeping loveliness;, by walls of cities, mosques, and palaces; under towers that rose as an, armed man with the steel on his brows and the frown of battle; by the, shores of the pale foaming sea it bore them, going at a pace that the, Arab on his steed outstrippeth not.  So when the sun was red and the dews, were blushing with new light, they struggled from a wilderness of barren, broken ground, and saw beneath them, in the warm beams, green, peaceful\\n\\nand lo! there was the Genie by a well under a palm, and he standing in, the shape of an Ass, saddled.  So they mounted him, and in a moment they, were in the midst of the desert, and naught round them save the hot, glimmer of the sands and the grey of the sky.  Surely, the Ass went at, such a pace as never Ass went before in this world, resting not by the, rivulets, nor under the palms, nor beside the date-boughs; it was as if, the Ass scurried without motion of his legs, so swiftly went he.  At last, the desert gave signs of a border on the low line of the distance, and, this grew rapidly higher as they advanced, revealing a country of hills, and rocks, and at the base of these the Ass rested.\\n\\nThen he yelled a glad yell, and stooped to Shibli Bagarag on the horse, and enveloped him, and seized him, and plucked him from the Horse, and, whirled him round, and flung him off.  The youth went circling in the, air, high in it, and descended, circling, at a distance in the deep, meadow-waters.  When he crept up the banks he saw the Genie astride the, Horse Garraveen, with a black flame round his head; and the Genie urged, him to speed and put him to the gallop, and was soon lost to sight, as he, had been a thunderbeam passing over a still lake at midnight.  And Shibli, Bagarag was smitten with the wrong and the folly of his act, and sought, to hide his sight from Noorna; but she called to him, 'Look up, O youth!, and face the calamity.  Lo, we have now lost the service of Karaz! for, though I utter ten spells and one spell in a breath, the Horse Garraveen, will ere that have stretched beyond the circle of my magic, and the Genie, will be free to do his ill deeds and plot against us.  Sad is it! but, profit thou by a knowledge of thy weakness.'\\n\\nThey relate that Shahpesh, the Persian, commanded the building of a, palace, and Khipil was his builder.  The work lingered from the first, year of the reign of Shahpesh even to his fourth.  One day Shahpesh went, to the riverside where it stood, to inspect it.  Khipil was sitting on a, marble slab among the stones and blocks; round him stretched lazily the, masons and stonecutters and slaves of burden; and they with the curve of, humorous enjoyment on their lips, for he was reciting to them adventures\\n\\nHe climbed the sides of the mountain, and was soon hidden in the clefts, and beyond the perches of the vulture.  She kept her eyes on the rocky, point when he disappeared, awaiting his return; and the sun went over her, head and sank on the yon-side of the mountain, and it was by the beams of, the moon that she beheld Shibli Bagarag dropping from the crags and, ledges of rock, sliding and steadying himself downward till he reached, her with the phial in his hand, filled; and he was radiant, as it were, divine with freshness, so that Noorna, before she spoke welcome to him\\n\\nAnd he cried, 'O King of the age, the barber is abased, trodden, underfoot, given over to the sneers and the gibes of them that flatter, the powerful ones; he is as the winter worm, as the crocodile in the, slime of his sleep by the bank, as the sick eagle before moulting.  But I, say, O King, that he will come forth like the serpent in a new skin\\n\\nThen said she, 'O Shibli Bagarag, 'tis achieved, this first of thy tasks;, for mutely on the fresh red of thy mouth, my betrothed, speaketh the, honey of persuasiveness, and the children of Aklis will not resist thee.', So she took the phial from him and led forth the Ass, and the twain, mounted the Ass and descended the slopes of the mountain in moonlight;, and Shibli Bagarag said, 'Lo! I have marked wonders, and lived a life, since our parting; and this well, 'tis a miracle to dip in it, and by it, sit many maidens weeping and old men babbling, and youths that were idle, youths striking bubbles from the surface of the water.  The well is, rounded with marble, and the sky is clear in it, cool in it, the whole, earth imaged therein.'\\n\\nand entered its circle, and that the two stars seemed mixing the, splendour that was theirs.  Now, that sight amazed me, and my heart in, its beating quickened with the expectation of things approaching.  Surely, I rendered praise, and pressed both hands on my bosom, and watched, and, behold! the comet, the illumined tadpole, was becoming restless beneath, the joint rays of the twain that were dominating him; and he diminished\\n\\narrowy, lance-like, like leaning sheaves, and crouching baboons, and, kicking jackasses, and cocks a-crow, and lutes slack-strung; and she, knelt and mumbled over and over words of magic, like the drone of a bee, to hear, and as a roll of water, nothing distinguishable.  After that she, sought for an unguent of a red colour, and smeared it on a part of the, floor by the corner of the room, and wrote on it in silver fluid a word, that was the word 'Eblis,' and over that likewise she droned awhile., Presently she arose with a white-heated face, the sweat on her brow, and, said to Shibli Bagarag and Feshnavat hurriedly and in a harsh tone, 'How?, have ye fear?'\\n\\nand the bones of travellers whiten in loneliness; and they continued, mounting upward by winding paths, now closed in by coverts, now upon open, heights having great views, and presently a mountain was disclosed to, them, green at the sides high up it; and Noorna bin Noorka said to Shibli, Bagarag, 'Mount here, for the cunning of this Ass can furnish him no, excuse further for making thee food for the birds of prey.'\\n\\nAnd Noorna said, 'Not only an entire city, but other cities affected by, him, as witness Oolb, whither thou wilt go; and there be governments and, states, and conditions of men remote, that hang upon him, Shagpat.  'Tis, even so; I swell not his size.  When thou hast mastered the Event, and, sent him forth shivering from thy blade like the shorn lamb, 'twill be, known how great a thing has been achieved, and a record for the, generations to come; choice is that historian destined to record it!'\\n\\nand settled on his head, and coated part of his body.  So when this, tadpole, that was once terrible to me, became turbaned, shoed, and, shawled with darkness, and there was little of him remaining visible, lo!, a concluding flash shot from thy star, and he fell heavily down the sky, and below the hills, into the sea, that is the Enchanted Sea, whose Queen, is Rabesqurat, Mistress of Illusions.  Now when my soul recovered from, amazement at the marvels seen, I arose and went from the starry roofs to, consult my books of magic, and 'twas revealed to me that one was, wandering to a junction with my destiny, and that by his means the great, aim would of a surety be accomplished--Shagpat Shaved!  So my purpose was, to discover him; and I made calculations, and summoned them that serve me, to search for such a youth as thou art; fairly, O my betrothed, did I, preconceive thee.  And so it was that I traced a magic line from the, sand-hills to the city, and from the outer hills to the sand-hills; and, whoso approached by that line I knew was he marked out as my champion, my, betrothed,--a youth destined for great things.  Was I right?  The egg, hatcheth.  Thou art already proved by thwackings, seasoned to the, undertaking, and I doubt not thou art he that will finish with that, tadpole Shagpat, and sit in the high seat, thy name an odour in distant, lands, a joy to the historian, the Compiler of Events, thou Master of the, Event, the greatest which time will witness for ages to come.'\\n\\nNow, the extent of the duration of his travel was four days and an equal, number of nights; and it was on the fifth morn that he entered the gates, of a city by the sea, even at that hour when the inhabitants were rising, from sleep: fair was the sea beyond it, and the harbour was crowded with, vessels, ships stored with merchandise--silks, dates, diamonds, Damascus, steel, huge bales piled on the decks for the land of Roum and other, lands.  Shibli Bagarag thought, 'There's scarce a doubt but that one of, those sails will set for Oolb shortly.  Wullahy! if I knew which, I'd, board her and win a berth in her.'  Presently he thought, 'I'll go to the, public fountain and question it with the speech-winning waters.', Thereupon he passed down the streets of the city and came to an open, space, where stood the fountain, and sprinkled it with Paravid; and the, fountain spake, saying, 'Where men are, question not dumb things.'\\n\\nmy betrothed! speak not of him in that fashion, 'tis dangerous; and my, power cannot keep off his emissaries at all times.'  Then she said, 'O my, betrothed, know me a sorceress ensorcelled; not that I seem, but that I, shall be!  Wait thou for the time and it will reward thee.  What! thou, think'st to have plucked a wrinkled o'erripe fruit,--a mouldy pomegranate, under the branches, a sour tamarind?  'Tis well!  I say nought, save that, time will come, and be thou content.  It is truly as I said, that I have, thee between me and Shagpat; and that honoured one of this city thought, fit in his presumption to demand me in marriage at the hands of my, father, knowing me wise, and knowing the thing that transformed me to, this, the abominable fellow!  Surely my father entertained not his, proposal save with scorn; but the King looked favourably on it, and it is, even now matter of reproach to Feshnavat, my father, that he withholdeth, me from Shagpat.'\\n\\nAnd the King swore by the beard of his father he would seize perforce the, hawk and shut up Shibli Bagarag in the vault, if he fell not into his, bargain.  Shibli Bagarag was advised by the hawk to accept the China jar, and the dress of Samarcand, and handed the hawk to the King in exchange, for these things.  So the King took the hawk upon his wrist and departed, with it to the apartments of his daughter, and Shibli Bagarag went to the, chamber prepared for him in the palace.\\n\\nHe promised her, and they lay and slept.  When he awoke the sun was half-, risen, and he looked at Noorna bin Noorka in the silken bag, and she was, yet in the peacefulness of pleasant dreams; but for the Ass, surely his, eyes rolled, and his head and fore legs were endued with life, while his, latter half seemed of stone.  And the youth called to Noorna bin Noorka\\n\\nYet put the case, that my kisses--I shower them not, Allah the All-seeing, is my witness! and they be given daintily as 'twere to the leaf of a, nettle, or over-hot pilau.  Yet haply kisses repeated might restore her, to a bloom, and it is certain youth is somehow stolen from her, if the, Vizier Feshnavat went before her, and his blood be her blood; and he is, powerful, she wise.  I'll decide to act the part of a rejoicer\\n\\nWhen she had spoken Shibli Bagarag considered her words, and the, knowledge that he was selected by destiny as Master of the Event inflated, him; and he was a hawk in eagerness, a peacock in pride, an ostrich in, fulness of chest, crying, 'O Noorna bin Noorka! is't really so?  Truly it, must be, for the readers of planets were also busy with me at the time of, my birth, interpreting of me in excessive agitation; and the thing they, foretold is as thou foretellest.  I am, wullahy! marked: I walk manifest, in the eye of Providence.'\\n\\nand beheld the shadows of the moon thrown forward into dimness across a, waste of sand.  And he stepped downward to the level of sand, and went, the way of the shadows till it was dawn.  Then dropped he a drop of the, waters of the phial on a spike of lavender, and there was a voice said to, him in reply to what he questioned, 'The path of the shadows of the sun.'\\n\\nThen the hawk whispered to Shibli Bagarag, 'Forward and shear him!'  So, he stepped forth and seized the tackle, and addressed himself keenly to, the shaving of the King of Oolb, lathering him and performing his task, with perfect skill.  And the courtiers crowded to follow the example of, the King, and Shibli Bagarag shaved them, all of them.  Now, when they, were shaved, fear smote them, the fear of ridicule, and each laughed at, the change that was in the other; but the King cried, 'See that order is, issued for the people of Oolb to be as we before to-morrow's sun.  So is, laughter taken in reverse.'  And the King said aside to Shibli Bagarag\\n\\nThen he said, 'All this while have ye talked, and no deliberation as to, that!  Lo, I have drawn the Cadi to our plot, and bribed him with a, mighty bribe; and I have prepared possible disguises for this nephew of, the barber; and I have had the witnesses of thy betrothal despatched to, foreign parts, far kingdoms in the land of Roum, to prevent tattling and, gabbling; and ye that were left alone for debating as to the great deed\\n\\nmurmuring still, 'I am under the eye of a man, or I dream.'  Now, while, she so murmured she arrayed herself, and took the cockle-shell, and, passed through the ante-room among her women sleeping; and Shibli Bagarag, tracked her till she came to the vault; and she entered it and walked to, the corner from which had hung the dress of Samarcand.  When she saw it, gone her face waxed pale, and she gazed slowly at all points, muttering\\n\\nSo the Vizier replied, 'He hath had thwackings, yet is he not deterred, from making further attempt on Shagpat.  I think well of him, and I augur, hopefully.  Wullahy! the Cadi shall be sent for; I can sleep in his, secresy; and he shall perform the ceremonies of betrothal, even now and, where we sit, and it shall be for him to write the terms of contract: so, shall we bind the youth firmly to us, and he will be one of us as we are\\n\\nSo the Vizier put that interrogation to Shibli Bagarag, and the youth was, in perplexity; thinking, 'Is it possible to be joyful in the embrace of, one that hath brought thwackings upon us, serious blows?'  Thinking, 'Yet, hath she, when the mood cometh, kindly looks; and I marked her eye, dwelling on me admiringly!' And he thought, 'Mayhap she that groweth, younger and counteth nature backwards, hath a history that would affect, me; or, it may be, my kisses--wah!  I like not to give them, and it is, said\\n\\nKhipil abased himself before Shahpesh, and answered, ''Tis even here, O, King of the age, where thou delightest the earth with thy foot and the, ear of thy slave with sweetness.  Surely a site of vantage, one that, dominateth earth, air, and water, which is the builder's first and chief, requisition for a noble palace, a palace to fill foreign kings and, sultans with the distraction of envy; and it is, O Sovereign of the time\\n\\nSo she said, 'Go!' and Shibli Bagarag showed her the breadth of his, shoulders, and stepped briskly toward the meadows, and was soon brushing, among the flowers and soft mosses of the meadows, lifting his nostrils to, the joyful smells, looking about him with the broad eye of one that, hungereth for a coming thing.  The birds went up above him, and the trees, shook and sparkled, and the waters of brooks and broad rivers flashed, like waving mirrors waved by the slave-girls in sport when the beauties, of the harem riot and dip their gleaming shoulders in the bath.  He, wandered on, lost in the gladness that lived, till the loud neigh of a, steed startled him, and by the banks of a river before him he beheld the, Horse Garraveen stooping to drink of the river; glorious was the look of, the creature,--silver-hoofed, fashioned in the curves of beauty and, swiftness.  So Shibli Bagarag put up his two hands and blew the call of, battle, and the Horse Garraveen arched his neck at the call, and swung, upon his haunches, and sought the call, answering it, and tossing his, mane as he advanced swiftly.  Then, as he neared, Shibli Bagarag held the, musk-ball in his fingers, and aimed at the fetlock of the, Horse Garraveen, and flung it, and struck him so that he stumbled and, fell.  He snorted fiercely as he bent to the grass, but Shibli Bagarag, ran to him, and grasped strongly the tuft of hair hanging forward between, his ears, and traced between his fine eyes a figure of the crescent with, his forenail, and the Horse ceased plunging, and was gentle as a colt by, its mother's side, and suffered Shibli Bagarag to bestride him, and spurn, him with his heel to speed, and bore him fleetly across the fair length, of the golden meadows to where Noorna bin Noorka sat awaiting him.  She, uttered a cry of welcome, saying, 'This is achieved with diligence and, skill, O my betrothed! and on thy right wrist I mark strength like a, sleeping leopard, and the children of Aklis will not resist thee.'\\n\\nNow, when he awoke he found himself alone in that place, the moon shining, over the low meadows and flower-cups fair with night-dew.  Odours of, night-flowers were abroad, filling the cool air with deliciousness, and, he heard in the gardens below songs of the bulbul: it was like a dream to, his soul, and he lay somewhile contemplating the rich loveliness of the, scene, that showed no moving thing.  Then rose he and bethought him of, the words of Noorna, and of the City of Oolb, and the phial of the waters, of Paravid in his vest; and he drew it forth, and dropped a drop of it on, the rock where he had reclined.  A deep harmony seemed suddenly to awake, inside the rock, and to his interrogation as to the direction of Oolb, he, heard, 'The path of the shadows of the moon.'\\n\\nQuoth he, looking eagerly at her, 'O Noorna, what is it in thy speech, affecteth me?  Surely it infuseth the vigour of wine, old wine; and I, shiver with desire to shave Shagpat, and spin threads for the historian, to weave in order.  I, wullahy! had but dry visions of the greatness, destined for me till now, my betrothed!  Shall I master an Event in, shaving him, and be told of to future ages?  By Allah and his Prophet, (praise be to that name!), this is greatness!  Say, Noorna, hadst thou, foreknowledge of me and my coming to this city?'\\n\\nthere was a deep growl of thunder, and the palace rocked, tottering; and, the air became smoky and full of curling vapours.  Presently they were, aware of the cry of a Cat, and its miaulings; and the patch of red, unguent on the floor parted and they beheld a tawny Cat with an arched, back.  So Noorna bin Noorka frowned fiercely at the Cat, and cried, 'This, is thy shape, O Karaz; change! for it serves not the purpose.'\\n\\nThe King then left him with a guard of twenty-five of his body-guard; and, they stood around him with bent bows, so that Khipil dared not move from, his sitting posture.  And the masons and the people crowded to see Khipil, sitting on his master's chair, for it became rumoured about.  When they, beheld him sitting upon nothing, and he trembling to stir for fear of the, loosening of the arrows, they laughed so that they rolled upon the floor, of the hall, and the echoes of laughter were a thousand-fold.  Surely the, arrows of the guards swayed with the laughter that shook them.\\n\\nand again another and another, rapidly, pertinaciously.  And from thy, star there passed repeated flashes across the head of the tadpole, till, his brilliance was as 'twere severed from him, and he, like drossy, silver, a dead shape in the conspicuous heavens.  And he became yellow as, the rolling eyes of sick wretches in pain, and shrank in his place like, pale parchment at the touch of flame; dull was he as an animal fascinated, by fear, and deprived of all power to make head against the foe\\n\\nThen Shahpesh laughed, and cried, 'Chafe not! it is an ill thing and a, hideous!  This nosegay, O Khipil, it is for thee to present to thy, mistress.  Truly she will receive thee well after its presentation!  I, will have it now sent in thy name, with word that thou followest quickly., And for thy nettled nose, surely if the whim seize thee that thou, desirest its chafing, to thy neighbour is permitted what to thy hand is, refused.'\\n\\nKhipil yet hesitated, for the gap was of many strides, and at the bottom, of the gap was a deep water, and he one that knew not the motion of, swimming.  But Shahpesh ordered his guard to point their arrows in the, direction of Khipil, and Khipil stepped forward hurriedly, and fell in, the gap, and was swallowed by the water below.  When he rose the second, time, succour reached him, and he was drawn to land trembling, his teeth, chattering.  And Shahpesh praised him, and said, 'This is an apt, contrivance for a bath, Khipil O my builder! well conceived; one that, taketh by surprise; and it shall be thy reward daily when much talking, hath fatigued thee.'\\n\\nThen she said to the Vizier Feshnavat, 'O my father, there is all in this, youth, the nephew of the barber, that's desirable for the undertaking;, and his feet will be on a level with the task we propose for him, he the, height of man above it.  'Tis clear that vanity will trip him, but, honesty is a strong upholder; and he is one that hath the spirit of, enterprise and the mask of dissimulation: gratitude I observe in him; and, it is as I thought when I came upon him on the sand-hill outside the, city, that his star is clearly in a web with our star, he destined for, the Shaving of Shagpat.'\\n\\nNow, when it was night, Shibli Bagarag heard a noise at his lattice, and, he arose and peered through it, and lo! the hawk was fluttering without;, so he let it in, and caressed it, and the hawk bade him put on his silken, dress and carry forth his China jar, and go the round of the palace, and, offer drink to the sentinels and the slaves.  So he did as the hawk, directed, and the sentinels and slaves were aware of a China jar brimmed, with wine that was lifted to their lips, but him that lifted it they saw, not: surely, they drank deep of the draught of astonishment.\\n\\nwhen suddenly, lo! a star from the upper heaven that shot down between, them wildly, and my star took lustre from it; and the star of Shagpat, trembled like a ring on a tightened rope, and waved and flickered, and, seemed to come forward and to retire; and 'twas presently as a comet in, the sky, bright,--a tadpole, with large head and lengthy tail, in the, assembly of the planets.  This I saw: and that the stranger star was, stationed by my star, shielding it, and that it drew nearer to my star\\n\\nSo Shibli Bagarag mounted, and they ceased not to ascend the green slopes, till the grass became scanty and darkness fell, and they were in a region, of snow and cold.  Then Noorna bin Noorka tethered the Ass to a stump of, a tree and breathed in his ear, and the Ass became as a creature carved, in stone; and she drew from her bosom two bags of silk, and blew in one, and entered it, bidding Shibli Bagarag do likewise with the other bag;, and he obeyed her, drawing it up to his neck, and the delightfulness of, warmth came over him.  Then said she, 'To-morrow, at noon, we shall reach, near the summit of the mountain and the Well of Paravid, if my power last, over this Ass; and from that time thou wilt be on the high road to, greatness, so fail not to remember what I have done for thee, and be not, guilty of ingratitude when thy hand is the stronger.'\\n\\nSo she said, ''Tis in Aklis, in the mountains of the Koosh; and the seven, sons of Aklis sharpen it day and night till the adventurer cometh to, claim it for his occasion.  Whoso succeedeth in coming to them they know, to have power over the sword, and 'tis then holiday for them.  Many are, the impediments, and they are as holes where the fox haunteth.  So they, deliver to his hand the sword till his object is attained, his Event, mastered, smitten through with it; and 'tis called the Sword of Events., Surely, with it the father of the Seven vanquished the mighty Roc\\n\\nand they were soon in the hollows of deep waters.  There was a berth in, the ship set apart for Shibli Bagarag, and one for the captain.  Shibli, Bagarag, when he entered his berth, beheld at the head of his couch a, hawk; its eyes red as rubies, its beak sharp as the curve of a scimitar., So he called out to the captain, and the captain came to him; but when he, saw the hawk, he plucked his turban from his head, and dashed it at the, hawk, and afterward ran to it, trying to catch it; and the hawk flitted, from corner to corner of the berth, he after it with open arms.  Then he, took a sword, but the hawk flew past him, and fixed on the back part of, his head, tearing up his hair by the talons, and pecking over his, forehead at his eyes.  And Shibli Bagarag heard the hawk scream the name, 'Karaz,' and he looked closely at the Captain of the vessel, and knew him, for the Genie Karaz.  Then trembled he with exceeding terror, cursing his, credulities, for he saw himself in the hands of the Genie, and nothing, but this hawk friendly to him on the fearful waters.  When the hawk had, torn up a certain hair, the Genie stiffened, and glowed like copper in, the furnace, the whole length of him; and he descended heavily through, the bottom of the ship, and sank into the waters beneath, which hissed, and smoked as at a bar of heated iron.  Then Shibli Bagarag gave thanks, to the Prophet, and praised the hawk, but the hawk darted out of the, cabin, and he followed it on deck, and, lo!  the vessel was in flames\\n\\nThen the hawk whispered in his ear, 'Drop on the tackle secretly a drop, from the phial.'  This he did, spreading his garments, and commanded the, tackle to speak.  And the tackle spake, each portion of it, confusedly as, the noise of Babel.  So the King marvelled greatly, and said, ''Tis a, greater wonder than the talking hawk, the talking tackle.  Wullahy! it, ennobleth barbercraft!  Yet it were well to comprehend the saying of the, tackle.'\\n\\nNow, so it was that the Vizier despatched a summons for the attendance of, the Cadi, and he carne and performed between Shibli Bagarag and Noorna, bin Noorka ceremonies of betrothal, and wrote terms of contract; and they, were witnessed duly by the legal number of witnesses, and so worded that, he had no claim on her as wife till such time as the Event to which he, bound himself was mastered.  Then the fees being paid, and compliments, interchanged, the Vizier exclaimed, 'Be ye happy! and let the weak cling, to the strong; and be ye two to one in this world, and no split halves, that betray division and stick not together when the gum is heated.', Then he made a sign to the Cadi and them that had witnessed the contract, to follow him, leaving the betrothed ones to their own company.\\n\\nNoorna bin Noorka continued, 'Thou knowest, O my father, I am proficient, in the arts of magic, and I am what I am, and what I shall be, by its, uses.  'Tis known to thee also that I hold a Genie in bondage, and can, utter ten spells and one spell in a breath.  Surely my services to the, youth in his attainment of the Sword will be beyond price!  Now to reach, Aklis and the Sword there are three things needed--charms: and one is a, phial full of the waters of Paravid from the wells in the mountain yon-, side the desert; and one, certain hairs that grow in the tail of the, horse Garraveen, he that roameth wild in the meadows of Melistan; and, one, that the youth gather and bear to Aklis, for the white antelope, Gulrevaz, the Lily of the Lovely Light that groweth in the hollow of the, crags over the Enchanted Sea: with these spells he will command the Sword, of Aklis, and nothing can bar him passage.  Moreover I will expend in his, aid all my subtleties, my transformations, the stores of my wisdom.  Many, seek this Sword, and people the realms of Rabesqurat, or are beasts in, Aklis, or crowned Apes, or go to feed the Roc, Kroojis, in the abyss, beneath the Roc's-egg bridge; but there's virtue in Shibli Bagarag:, wullahy!  I am wistful in him of the hand of Destiny, and he will succeed, in this undertaking if he dareth it.'\\n\\nShe jeered him as they journeyed, and made the soul of Shibli Bagarag, merry, so that he jerked in his seat upon the Ass.  Now, as they ascended, the mountain they came to the opening of a cavern, and Noorna bin Noorka, halted the Ass, and said to Shibli Bagarag, 'We part here, and I wait for, thee in this place.  Take this phial, and fill it with the waters of the, well, after thy bath.  The way is before thee--speed on it.'\\n\\nThen, after they had gazed awhile, Noorna bin Noorka said, 'In these, meadows the Horse Garraveen roameth at will.  Heroes of bliss bestride, him on great days.  He is black to look on; speed quivers in his flanks, like the lightning; his nostrils are wide with flame; there is that in, his eye which is settled fire, and that in his hoofs which is ready, thunder; when he paws the earth kingdoms quake: no animal liveth with, blood like the Horse Garraveen.  He is under a curse, for that he bore on, his back one who defied the Prophet.  Now, to make him come to thee thou, must blow the call of battle, and to catch him thou must contrive to, strike him on the fetlock as he runs with this musk-ball which I give, thee; and to tame him thou must trace between his eyes a figure or the, crescent with thy forenail.  When that is done, bring him to me here\\n\\nNow, at her words the whole Genie became as live coal with anger, and he, panted black and bright, and made a stride toward Shibli Bagarag, and, stretched his arm out to seize him; but Noorna, blew quickly on the, circles she had drawn, and the circles rose up in a white flame high as, the heads of those present, and the Genie shrank hastily back from the, flame, and was seized with fits of sneezing.  Then she said in scorn\\n\\nNow, the King ceased not persecuting Khipil, under pretence of doing him, honour and heaping favours on him.  Three days and three nights was, Khipil gasping without water, compelled to drink of the drought of the, fountain, as an honour at the hands of the King.  And he was seven days, and seven nights made to stand with, stretched arms, as they were the branches of a tree, in each hand a, pomegranate.  And Shahpesh brought the people of his court to regard the, wondrous pomegranate shoot planted by Khipil, very wondrous, and a new, sort, worthy the gardens of a King.  So the wisdom of the King was, applauded, and men wotted he knew how to punish offences in coin, by the, punishment inflicted on Khipil the builder.  Before that time his affairs, had languished, and the currents of business instead of flowing had, become stagnant pools.  It was the fashion to do as did Khipil, and fancy, the tongue a constructor rather than a commentator; and there is a doom, upon that people and that man which runneth to seed in gabble, as the, poet says in his wisdom:\\n\\nHe answered, 'Surely all was made smooth for me by thy aid.  Now when I, came to the well I marked not them by it, but plunged, and the depth of, that well seemed to me the very depth of the earth itself, so went I ever, downward; and when I was near the bottom of the well I had forgotten life, above, and lo! no sooner had I touched the bottom of the well when my, head emerged from the surface: 'twas wondrous!  But for a sign that, touched the bottom of the well, see, O Noorna bin Noorka, the Jewel, the, one of myriads that glitter at the bottom, and I plucked it for a gift to, thee.'\\n\\nHe conducted Shahpesh among the unfinished saloons and imperfect courts, and roofless rooms, and by half erected obelisks, and columns pierced and, chipped, of the palace of his building.  And he was bewildered at the, words spoken by Shahpesh; but now the King exalted him, and admired the, perfection of his craft, the greatness of his labour, the speediness of, his construction, his assiduity; feigning not to behold his negligence.\\n\\nand left it no outlet.  Now, as Shibli Bagarag watched the hawk, the, flames stretched out towards him and took hold of his vestments.  So he, delayed not to commend his soul to the All-merciful, and bore witness to, his faith, and plunged into the sea headlong.  When he rose, the ship had, vanished, and all was darkness where it had been; so he buffeted with the, billows, thinking his last hour had come, and there was no help for him, in this world; and the spray shaken from the billows blinded him, the, great walls of water crumbled over him; strength failed him, and his, memory ceased to picture images of the old time--his heart to beat with, ambition; and to keep the weight of his head above the surface was, becoming a thing worth the ransom of kings.  As he was sinking and, turning his eyes upward, he heard a flutter as of fledgling's wings, and, the two red ruby eyes of the hawk were visible above him, like steady, fires in the gloom.  And the hawk perched on him, and buried itself among, the wet hairs of his head, and presently taking the Identical in its, beak, the hawk lifted him half out of water, and bore him a distance, and, dropped him.  This the hawk did many times, and at the last, Shibli, Bagarag felt land beneath him, and could wade through the surges to the, shore.  He gave thanks to the Supreme Disposer, kneeling prostrate on the, shore, and fell into a sleep deep in peacefulness as a fathomless well\\n\\nand pointed to her the strangeness of the condition of the Ass.  As she, cast eyes on him she cried out, and rushed to him, and took him by the, ears and blew up his nostrils, and the animal was quiet.  Then she and, Shibli Bagarag mounted him again, and she said to him, 'It is well thou, wert more vigilant than I, and that the sun rose not on this Ass while I, slept, or my enchantment would have thawed on him, and he would have, 'scaped us.'\\n\\n'There is no further doubt but that I am under the eye of a man!', Thereupon she ran hastily from the vault, and passed between the, sentinels of the palace, and saw them where they lay drowsy with, intoxication: so she knew that the China jar and the dress of Samarcand, had been used that night, and for no purpose friendly to her wishes., Then she passed down the palace steps, and through the gates of the, palace and the city, till she came to the shore of the sea; there she, launched the cockle-shell and took the wind in her garments, and sat in, it, filling it to overflowing, yet it floated.  And Shibli Bagarag waded, to the cockle-shell and took hold of it, and was drawn along by its, motion swiftly through the waters, so that a foam swept after him; and, Goorelka marked the foam.  Now, they had passage over the billows, smoothly, and soon the length of the sea was darkened with two high, rocks, and between them there was a narrow channel of the sea, roughened, with moonlight.  So they sped between the rocks, and came upon a purple, sea, dark-blue overhead, with large stars leaning to the waves.  There, was a soft whisperingness in the breath of the breezes that swung there\\n\\nThe hawk flapped its wings and winked both eyes; so Shibli Bagarag took, forth the phial from his breast, remembering the virtues of the waters of, the Well of Paravid, and touched his lips with them, that he might be, endowed with flowing speech before the King of Oolb.  As he did this the, phial was open, and the hawk leaned to it and dipped its beak into the, water; and he entered the city and passed through the long streets, towards the palace of the King, and craved audience of him as one that, had a thing marvellous to tell.  So the King commanded that Shibli, Bagarag should be brought before him, for he was a lover of marvels.  As, he went into the presence of the King, Shibli Bagarag listened to the, hawk, for the hawk spake his language, and it said, 'Proclaim to the King, a new wonder--\\\"the talking hawk.\\\"'\\n\\nKhipil plucked a handful of the nettles that were there in the place of, flowers, and put his nose to them before Shahpesh, till his nose was, reddened; and desire to rub it waxed in him, and possessed him, and, became a passion, so that he could scarce refrain from rubbing it even in, the King's presence.  And the King encouraged him to sniff and enjoy, their fragrance, repeating the poet's words:\",\n          \"The dream was over--the blessed dream of philanthropy and reform! The, reins of power had been snatched from his hands, and Joseph was once, more consigned to a life of insignificant inactivity. Like a wounded, bird, whose broken wing no longer bears him aloft his heart fluttered, and fell--its high hopes dashed to earth. The old influences which he, hated, were at work again, and he had no recourse but absolute silence., His deep humiliation, he was constrained to hide under a mask of, serenity; but he knew that his spirit was crushed, and night fell over, his stricken soul. Still, he struggled against the chill of his despair\\n\\nand sting the pride of our nationality. With their tyrannical commercial, edicts, they have dealt injury to friends as well as foes. The closing, of the Scheldt and Rhine, the Barrier treaty, and all the other, restrictions upon trade devised by those crafty English to damage the, traffic of other nations, all these compacts have been made as binding, upon Austria as upon every other European power. Unmindful of their, alliance with us, the maritime powers have closed their ports against, our ships; and while affecting to watch the Netherlands in our behalf\\n\\n\\\"Complain if you choose, it is indifferent to me,\\\" cried Joseph, with a, hoarse laugh. \\\"Never in this world shall you be my wife. If the hateful, tie that binds me to you cannot be unloosed, I will make you answerable, for every day of disgust and misery that I am forced to pass under the, same roof with you. If I am cursed before the world with the name of, your husband. I shall punish you in secret with my everlasting hate.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor with his two companions walked toward the village. Nothing, very hopeful was to be seen as they looked up the dirty little streets., The wretched mud cottages stood each one apart, their yards separated by, scraggy willow-hedges, upon which ragged old garments were hanging in, the sun to dry. Between the hedges were muddy pools, over which the, ducks were wrangling for the bits of weed that floated on the surface of, the foul waters. On their borders, in the very midst of the rubbish and, kitchen offal that lay about in heaps, dirty, half-naked children, with, straw-colored hair, tumbled over one another, or paddled in the water., In the farm-yards around the dung-heaps, the youngest children of the, cottagers kept company with the sow and her grunting pigs. Before the, slovenly entrances of the huts here and there sat dirty, unseemly old, men and women, who stared at the three strangers as they surveyed the, uninviting picture before them.\\n\\n\\\"Peace, Binder, my story is not yet ended. One morning the dog and the, cat were found dead in THEIR corner; and in the other, the fox lay, bleeding and moaning; while of the hen, nothing remained save her, feathers.

The fox, after much pondering over his misfortunes\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" said he, after a long and painful pause, \\\"not a word of thanks!, Joy has made you dumb, I perceive. And no wonder; for to feel (for the, first time) the pleasures of benevolence may well make you speechless, with happiness. As for you, madame,\\\" continued the emperor, addressing, his hostess, \\\"I will not deprive you of a share in your husband's, generosity. You will be so kind as to call up your servants and bid them, load a wagon with the remains of our excellent dinner, not forgetting, the wines; and you will then send it, with your greetings, to your, tenants in yonder village. Your servants can go from house to house, until the store is exhausted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hear the coward!\\\" cried Gluck vehemently; \\\"see the woman's nature, shrinking from the path of honor because it is beset with danger. I did, well not to let you know the nature of my last labors, for with your, sighs and croakings you would have turned me back again into the highway, of falsehood. But you are too late, poltroon. The work is done, and it, shall see light.\\\" Gluck looked at his wife's face, and the expression he, saw there made him pause. He was already sorry, and ready to atone. \\\"No\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty,\\\" said she, with an expression of painful anxiety, \\\"I, entreat of you not to revoke that privilege! Believe me when I tell you, that it is dangerous to interfere with customs which are so old that the, people have grown to look upon them as right. Ever since the days of, Francis I the royal family has dined in public, and every decently-clad, person has enjoyed the privilege of entering the banquet-room. Moreover\\n\\nMeanwhile, the young emperor was in his palace. The anterooms were, filled with petitioners of every sort, who, through bribes offered to, the members of the imperial household, had penetrated thus far, and were, now awaiting the appearance of the emperor. The anterooms of Maria, Theresa had always been thronged with these petitioners, and now they, jostled each other without ceremony, each one hoping to be remarked by, the emperor as he passed on to his carriage.\\n\\n\\\"Write; yes. You wrote me to say that you would not consent to be mine, unless I carried you away from Vienna. Then you went on to order our, mode of travelling as you would have done had I been your husband. 'Be, here at such an hour; have your passes for various countries. Describe, me therein as your sister. Come through the garden and await me at the, head of the secret stairway.' Is this a love-letter? It is a mere note, of instructions. For one week I have waited for a look, a sigh, a, pressure of the hand; and when I come hither to take you from your home, forever, you receive me as if I were a courier. No, Margaret, no--I will, not wait to speak my love until we are in Paris.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the second day after the wedding. On the first evening the opera, of \\\"Orpheus and Eurydice\\\" had been triumphantly represented before the, elite of the city. A second representation had been called for by the, delighted audience, although at the imperial palace a magnificent mask, ball was to be given, for which two thousand invitations had been, issued. It was a splendid confusion of lights, jewels, velvet, satins\\n\\nOne hour later the emperor returned from the hotel of his prime, minister, and entered the imperial chapel. He was in full dress, decked, with all his orders. It was only on state occasions that Joseph appeared, in his magnificent uniform; he had not worn it since the marriage of his, nephew to the Princess Elizabeth of Wurtemberg. But his face was very, pale, and when he perceived the bride, he leaned for one moment against, a friendly pillar that saved him from reeling. This weakness, however\\n\\n\\\"They will return to their homes,\\\" said the queen, slightly raising her, shoulders, \\\"and when they reflect coolly on the subject, they will, certainly not think less of me because I prefer to dine like the rest of, the world. I believe that if we desire popularity with the people, we, must show them that we have feeling hearts like themselves, and it is by, such means that I hope to gain the love of the French nation.\\\"\\n\\nLouis looked searchingly at the face of his young wife. \\\"He died of a, malady whose name is an impeachment of the honor of those who survive, him,\\\" said the dauphin, sternly, \\\"and my mother died of the same, disease. [Footnote: It was generally believed that the dauphin and his, wife were poisoned by a political party, whose leader was the Duke de, Choiseul. The royal couple belonged to the anti-Austrian party., \\\"Memoires de Campan,\\\" vol. i., p. 78.] But let us not throw any darker, shadows over the gloom of this heavy hour. I am stifled--I have a, presentiment of--\\\" A loud shout interrupted the dauphin. It came nearer, and nearer, and now it reached the anteroom, where the crowding, courtiers were pouring in to greet King Louis XVI.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty, music has cut off her queue, and really in her new, coiffure she is divinely beautiful. Moreover, your majesty has rewarded, the seventy years of Metastasio with a rich pension, proof enough to him, of the estimation in which his talents are held.

Your majesty's self has created this Austria, and, you owe to her children your imperial countenance and favor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wished to see this asylum of which you had heard, did you not?\\\", asked the queen with a shade of bitterness. \\\"I have been calumniated to, you, as I have been to the king and to the French people.

I know that about these, very rooms, lewd songs are sung on the Pont-Neuf which make the Count de, Provence hold his sides with laughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The same. You should have seen the despair of the king. But he was, amiable even in his grief. He tried all sorts of lover's stratagems to, win back the countess; he prowled around her house at night singing like, a Troubadour; be wrote her bushels of letters to implore an interview., All in vain. The liaison with Repnin was made public, and that, of, course, ended the affair. The king was inconsolable. [Footnote: Wraxall\\n\\nHis wife laid her hand upon his arm. \\\"And upon whom falls the light of, day, if not upon you?\\\" asked she, reproachfully. \\\"Look back upon your, twenty operas, and see each one bearing its laurel-wreath, and shouting, to the world your fame! And now look into the future, and see their, unborn sisters, whose lips one day will open to the harmony of your, music, and will teach all nations to love your memory! And I\\n\\nshould preserve them with my regalia at Vienna. All strife and jealousy, between the provinces composing my empire must cease. [Footnote: The, Emperor's own words.--\\\"Letters of Joseph II.\\\"] Provincial interests, must disappear before national exigencies. This is all that I have to, say to the states; but I will say to yourselves, that when I find myself, absolute lord of Hungary, as well as of Austria, I will go thither to be, crowned. And now, Lord Chancellor of Hungary, what other grievance have, you to present?\\\"\\n\\nShe bent over the parchment and wrote; then, throwing her pen on the, floor, she turned to the emperor and pointed with her right hand to the, deed. \\\"Placet,\\\" cried she, with her clear, ringing voice--\\\"placet, since, so many great and wise men will have it so. When I am dead, the world, will learn what came of this violation of all that man holds sacred.\\\", [Footnote: The empress's own words.]\\n\\nWhile the empress, in the full splendor of her rank and beauty, was, representing the sovereign of Austria, the emperor, mingling with the, guests, was taking the liberty of amusing himself as ordinary mortals, love to do at a masked ball. On his arm hung a mask of most graceful, figure, but so completely was she disguised that nothing could be, ascertained with regard to her name or rank. Some whispered that it was, the emperor's new favorite, the Countess of Auersberg.\\n\\n\\\"I know perfectly well the nature of his malady,\\\" thought she. \\\"Whenever, he desires to consult with the emperor before seeing me, he falls sick., Whenever danger is ahead and affairs look stormy he retreats to his hole, like a discreet fox. I wish to Heaven that I too could take to my bed, and shut my eyes to all that is transpiring around us! But no,\\\", continued the empress with a pang of self-reproach, \\\"I have no right to, retire from the post of danger. I must act, and act quickly, or Joseph, will be before me. Oh, my God, help me in my great need.\\\"\\n\\nNever before had any member of the Aulic Council dared to leave that, room until the lord chancellor had given the signal of departure. It was, a case of unparalleled violation of court etiquette. Count Uhlefeld was, aghast, and Bartenstein seemed crushed. Without exchanging a word, the, two friends rose, and with eyes cast down, and faces pale with the, anguish of that hour, together they left the council-chamber toward, which they had repaired with hearts and bearing so triumphant.\\n\\nThe count laughed aloud. \\\"Ah!\\\" cried he, in a harsh, grating voice, \\\"you, think that I might do like Prince Bragation and the Duke of Orleans, who, strangled their young wives because they suspected them of infidelity!, My dear madame, these romantic horrors belong to a bygone century. In, this sober and prosaic age, a nobleman avenges his wounded honor, not by, murder, but by contempt. I have only intruded myself to ask if you are, ready to start?\\\"\\n\\nThe first days of a smiling spring had filled the park with hundreds of, splendid equipages and prancing horsemen. There was the carriage of the, Princess Esterhazy, with twenty outriders in the livery of the prince;, that of the new Prince Palm, whose four black horses wore their harness, of pure gold; there was the gilded fairy, like vis-a-vis of the, beautiful Countess Thun, its panels decorated with paintings from the, hands of one of the first artists of the day; the coach of the Countess, Dietrichstein, drawn by four milk-white horses, whose delicate pasterns, were encircled by jewelled bracelets worthy of glittering upon the arm, of a beauty. In short, the aristocracy of Austria, Hungary, and Lombardy, were there, in all the splendor of their wealth and rank. It seemed as, though Spring were holding a levee, and the nobles of the empire had, thronged her flowery courts.\\n\\n\\\"Rather, your majesty,\\\" said Father Francis, \\\"let us pray Heaven to, soften his heart.\\\" The emperor alone said nothing; but he looked at the, boy with a friendly and sympathizing glance. The child saw the look, and, for one moment a flush of pleasure passed over his face. He raised his, eyes with an appealing expression toward his father, who could no longer, resist the temptation of coming to his relief.\\n\\n\\\"From the recall of Baron von Reidsel and the marching of your majesty's, troops into Bohemia, I perceive with profoundest sorrow that we are on, the eve of another war. My age, and sincere love of peace, are known to, all the world, and I can give no greater proof of this love than I do by, writing to your majesty. My maternal heart, too, is sorely grieved with, the thought that I have two sons and a beloved son-in-law in the army. I, have taken this step without the knowledge of the emperor, and whatever, its result, I exact that it shall remain a secret between us. It is my, desire to resume the negotiations which were broken off by my son. Baron, Thugut, who will deliver this into your majesty's hands, has received my, instructions, and is empowered to treat with you. I trust that your, majesty may deem it consistent with our common dignity to meet my wishes, in this matter, and hope that you also correspond to the earnest desire, which I cherish for a continuation of friendly relations with your, majesty. With this hope I remain, \\\"Your majesty's affectionate sister, and cousin, \\\"MARIA THERESA.\\\" [Footnote: This letter was written in the, French language, and is to be found in Cross-Hoffinger's \\\"Life and, History of the Reign of Joseph II.,\\\" vol. iv., p. 89.]\\n\\nThe countess remained looking at the parer for a time, then she raised, her tearful eyes to the face of the empress. \\\"I thank your majesty,\\\", said she, deeply moved, \\\"for allowing me to see this letter. It will, remain in history as a noble monument of Maria Theresa's rectitude. I, have no longer a word of blame for you; and once again, in love and, reverence, I kiss this hand, although I know that to-day it must sign, the death-warrant of unhappy Poland.\\\"\\n\\nIt was natural, then, that the majority of the Aulic Council should vote, for the old alliance. While they argued and voted, Kaunitz, the least, important personage of them all, sat perfectly unconcerned, paying not, the slightest attention to the wise deductions of his colleagues. He, seemed much occupied in straightening loose papers, mending his pen, and, removing with his finger-tips the tiny, specks that flecked the lustre, of his velvet coat. Once, while Bartenstein was delivering his long, address, Kaunitz carried his indifference so far as to draw out his, repeater (on which was painted a portrait of La Pompadour, set in, diamonds) and strike the hour! The musical ring of the little bell, sounded a fairy accompaniment to the deep and earnest tones of, Bartenstein's voice; while Kaunitz, seeming to hear nothing else, held, the watch up to his ear and counted its strokes. [Footnote: Vide, Kormayr, \\\"Austrian Plutarch,\\\" vol. xii., p.352.] The empress, who was, accustomed to visit the least manifestation of such inattention on the, part of her councillors with open censure--the empress, so observant of, form, and so exacting of its observance in others--seemed singularly, indulgent to-day; for while Kaunitz was listening to the music of his, watch, his imperial mistress looked on with half a smile. At last, when, the fifth orator had spoken, and it became the turn of Kaunitz to vote\\n\\nSuddenly she turned toward Father Porhaminer, who, with the Countess, Fuchs, stood by the side of the sofa from which she had risen. \\\"Father,\\\", said she, in a tremulous voice, \\\"I cannot tell why it is that, as I, await my son's presence here, my heart is overwhelmed with anguish. I, feel as if I were about to do him an injustice, and for all the kingdoms, of the world I would not do him wrong.\\\"\\n\\nThe elite of Vienna were assembled in the drawing-room of Herr von, Paradies. The aristocratic, the scientific, and the artistic world were, represented; and the empress, as before intimated, had sent her, messenger to take notes of the extraordinary experiment which was that, day to be tried upon the person of her young pensioner. At the request, of Mesmer, some of the lower classes were there also, for it was his, desire that the cottage as well as the palace should bear testimony to, the triumph of animal magnetism over the prejudices of conventional, science.\\n\\nThe emperor shook his lead. \\\"Were this true,\\\" replied he, \\\"Poland would, never have fallen as she has done. But far be it from me to heap, reproaches upon the unfortunate. I will do what it lies in my power to, do for the Poles, provided they are willing to second my efforts for, themselves. If they would have peace, however, with other nations, they, must show strength and unity of purpose among themselves. Until they can, stand before the world in the serried ranks of a national unanimity\\n\\nShe broke into a loud laugh, and striking her horse with the whip, tried, to gallop off again. But the emperor put spurs to his horse, and the two, dashed on together. Neck and neck they ran; the countess lashing her, Arabian until he made wild leaps into the air, the emperor urging his, Barb with whip and spur, until his flanks were white with foam. At last, he came so near, that he made a grasp at her rein and caught it\\n\\nand foreign influence. To that intent, my lord chamberlain, you will see, that all foreigners are dismissed from the palace, and their places, supplied by Germans. My two Italian valets I make over to Porhammer., Nothing but German shall be spoken at court. I will have neither French, nor Italian actors here. Count Durazzo shall dismiss his foreign troupes, and employ Germans in their stead. [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, \\\"History, of Joseph II.,\\\" vol. i., p. 91.] Let him see that the German stage, flourishes and does honor to the metropolis of the German empire.\\\"\\n\\n, The beautiful Countess Baillou was about to give a ball. She had invited, all the haut ton of Vienna, and they had accepted the invitations. And, yet the countess had been but four weeks in the Austrian capital; she, had no relations there, and none of the aristocracy had ever heard her, name before. But she had come to Vienna provided with letters of, introduction, and money; and these two keys had opened the saloons of, the fashionables to the beautiful stranger.\\n\\n\\\"And she, too, deceived me,\\\" said he; \\\"those smiles, those glances, that, love, all were false. While she lay in my arms and listened to my words, of love, her heart was in the grave with her murdered lover! Oh, my God!, now that I know that she deceived me, in whom can I place my trust? Even, now, what am I but a dependent boy, the slave of the empress and of her, all-powerful minister, who force upon me a woman whom I hate, and bid me, make her the mother of my children? Oh, when will my shackles fall, when, shall I be free!\\\"\\n\\nZweibrucken, and Saxony, had been disentangling the threads of the, Bavarian succession. For three months Joseph had hoped and prayed that, the debates of the peace congress might come to naught, and its, deliberations engender a veritable war. But he was destined to new, disappointment. The love of peace had prevailed. Austria had renounced, all her inheritance in Bavaria, save the Innviertel, and had declared, her treaty with Charles Theodore to be null and void.\\n\\nThe preparations were at an end; the archduke bad taken formal leave of, his mother's court; this evening he was to spend in the imperial family, circle; and early on the next morning his journey would begin. He had, just written a last note of farewell to a friend. Alone in his room, he, stood before a mirror, contemplating with a smile his own image. He was, not looking at his handsome face, though happiness was lending it, exquisite beauty; the object of his rapturous admiration was the white, uniform, which, for the first time, he wore in place of his court-dress., He was no longer the descendant of Charles the Fifth, no longer the son, of the empress, he was a soldier--a free, self-sustaining man, whose, destiny lay in his own hands, and whose future deeds would prove him, worthy to be the son of his great ancestor.\\n\\nThe empress smiled, while Kaunitz knelt and kissed her fair, jewelled, hand. \\\"May God grant that you speak truth, Kaunitz, and may my posterity, not have to blush for me! 'Every thing for Austria,' shall be your motto, and mine; and this flaming device shall light us on our way through, life. Now go, lord high chancellor, and see that the world finds a, phoenix in the ashes of the old regime which to-day we have consigned to, the dust!\\\" [Footnote: From this time, Kaunitz was the sole minister of, the empress; and he kept his promise to Binder, who became state, referendarius, in the place of the once-powerful Bartenstein.]\\n\\nShe was radiant with smiles, and happiness flashed from her still bright, eyes; but on this day of rejoicing there was one void that pained the, empress--it was the absence of her eldest son. Since his return to, Vienna, three months before, there had never yet been a word of, explanation between Joseph and his mother. He had studiously avoided, being alone with her, had never made his appearance in council, and when, documents had been presented to him for signature, he had no sooner, perceived the sign-manual of the empress, than he had added his own, without examination or comment.\\n\\n\\\"So it is, so it is,\\\" shouted the multitude. \\\"The queen owes us a, rose-bud, and we must have it.\\\" \\\"See here, pretty queen,\\\" cried another, fish-wife, \\\"it is your fault if we stand here on the staircases and out, in the hot sun to-day. If you had done your duty to France instead of, leaving it to the princess in yonder, the lackeys would have been, obliged to open the doors to us as well as to the great folks, and we, would have jostled the dukes and princes, and taken our ease on your, velvet sofas. The next time we come here, we must have a tramp into the, queen's room, and she must let us see herself and a brave dauphin, too.\\\"\\n\\nThe curtain rose, and, in a funeral hall, Orpheus poured forth his grief, for the loss of his Eurydice. With this pathetic complaint mingled the, voices of the chorus of mourners; then a solo from Orpheus, in which he, bewails anew the fate of the noble woman who had died for his sake. The, god of love appears, counselling him to descend himself to the infernal, regions. Orpheus, strengthened and revived by hope, resolves to tempt, the dangerous descent, and calls upon his friends to share his fate.\\n\\nJosepha was sad as she thought of these things, but she could not, suppress an emotion of joy when she saw the brilliant cortege hat was, coming from Vienna to meet her. This proud and handsome horseman, whose, blue eyes shone like stars, this was her husband, the lord of her, destiny! She had seen him once before, and had loved him from that, moment. True, he had not chosen her from inclination, but she could not, shut her heart to the bliss of being his wife, he who, to-day a king\\n\\n\\\"Yes, her life,\\\" said Van Swieten, solemnly. \\\"The empress has the, small-pox.\\\" [Footnote: The Empress Josepha died May 28, 1767, at the age, of twenty nine years. Her body was so decayed by small pox, that, before, her death the flesh fell from her in pieces. It was so completely, decomposed, that it was impossible to pay it the customary funeral, honors. It was hurriedly wrapped up in a linen cloth, and coffined. From, these circumstances a rumor prevailed in Bavaria that she had not died\\n\\n\\\"You must weigh well your behavior toward the czarina. I dare not advise, the emperor, but let me advise you. You have often occasion to see the, empress. Before you see her consult with me as to the topics of your, discourse with her, and so we shall always be enabled to act in concert., Avoid ail dissimulation; let her perceive that you leave craft to the, lovers of Prussia. Flatter as often as you see fit; flatter Catharine\\n\\n\\\"By all means. Let us hope that they bring us good news. I gave, stringent orders to Belgiojoso to see that my will was carried out in, Belgium. I bade him inform the people that they should not: have their, precious soap-boiler back; that he was my subject, and I intended to, have him tried here. I told him, moreover, that, like all my other, subjects, the Belgians must pay new taxes without expecting to be, consulted as to the expediency of the measure.\\\"\\n\\nDown went the obsequious heads, while Kaunitz continued, with his fine, cambric handkerchief, to remove the last specks of powder from his, eyelids. When he had sufficiently caressed and admired himself, he went, to the door. It opened, and two valets, who stood outside, presented, him, one with a jewelled snuff-box, the other with an embroidered, handkerchief. A large brown dog, that lay couchant in the hall, rose and, followed him, and the last act of the daily farce was over.\\n\\n\\\"I am revenged!\\\" thought he. \\\"Short-sighted emperor, you do not dream, that you arc the tool wherewith the Jew has wreaked his vengeance upon, the Christian! Go on, and ruin your faithful friend! Go on, hot-headed, judge; punish the man who loves you, without giving him a hearing; and, imagine yourself to be administering justice, while you inflict the, grossest injustice. It is so Christian-like. Follow the instincts of, your love and hate, your passion or your pleasures, ye children of the, moment, while the calculating Jew plays upon your credulity!--And now\\n\\nThere wanted now but a few months to complete the third year of the, archduke's marriage, and the young princesses seized every opportunity, to make schemes of pleasure for the joyous anniversary. Isabella viewed, these projects with a mournful smile. Her countenance became sadder and, more serious, except when in the presence of her husband. There she, assumed an appearance of gayety: laughing, jesting, and drawing from her, violin its sweetest sounds. But, with her attendants, or in the company, of the other members of the imperial family, she was melancholy, and, made her preparations for death, which she foretold would overtake her, very soon.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you had better defer your journey for a day to attend her, funeral. All the Poles will be there; and as we both knew and admired, her, I think it would propitiate our new subjects if we gave some public, mark of sympathy by following the body to the grave. I have forbidden, mention to be made of the manner of her death, that she may not be, denied a resting-place within consecrated ground.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" said the emperor, with a deep sigh, \\\"be it so. I will do, as you like, but I must for ever and ever yield my will to that of, others. Call a deputation of the provinces, and cite the, governor-general and his wife, also to Vienna. I will investigate as a, father before I condemn as a judge. But if this last proof of my, goodness should be of no avail, then I shall strike; and if blood flow, in torrents-upon their heads and not mine, be the sin.\\\" [Footnote:, Joseph's own words. Seo Hubner, ii., p. 454.]\\n\\nJoseph looked with genuine emotion at the agitated countenance of his, mother. He saw the tears gather and fall from her eyes; he saw the, quivering lip, the trembling frame; he felt that her integrity was, beyond suspicion, her love for him beyond all question. The icy barriers, that had closed upon his heart, gave way; he felt the warm and sunny, glow of a mother's unspeakable love, and, yielding to the impulse of the, moment, he flung his arms around the empress's neck, while he covered, her face with kisses. \\\"Mother, my dear mother!\\\" sobbed he; and as if, these words had opened the floodgates of all the love which filled his, heart, he leaned his head upon her bosom, and was silent.\\n\\n\\\"Hm; something very like it, I assure you. Listen! It is the secret, treaty that our minister at Constantinople, Herr von Thugut, has just, concluded with the Porte. The Sultan has already signed it, and to-day I, shall present it for signature to the empress. She will do it readily;, for although she may not absolutely dote on the infidel, she hates, Russia; and the unbelieving Turk is dearer to her than her Christian, cousin, the Empress Catharine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not pretend to judge of the acts of the rulers of earth,\\\" replied, he gloomily. \\\"Perhaps the deeds which in ordinary people would be called, cowardly, may with them be great and noble. I know nothing about it; but, I know what my beloved empress once said to me. She was then young and, energetic, and she had not forgotten the oath she had taken when the, archbishop crowned her at St. Stephen's--the oath which bound her to be, a faithful ruler over her people until God released her.\\\"\\n\\nIn a quarter of an hour they had reached the village. The same absence, of all life struck painfully upon the emperor's heart as they walked, along the deserted streets and heard nothing save the echo of their own, footsteps. Not the lowing of a cow nor the bleating of a sheep, not one, familiar rural sound broke the mournful stillness that brooded over the, air. Occasionally a ghastly figure in tattered garments, from whose, vacant eyes the light of reason seemed to have fled, was seen crouching, at the door of a hut, wherein his wife and children were starving. This, was the only token of life that greeted the eyes of the grave and silent, pair.\\n\\nThe truth was, that Louis was envious of the enthusiasm which Joseph, excited among the Parisians; and his brothers, the other members of the, royal family, and his ministers, took every opportunity of feeding his, envy, by representing that the emperor was doing his utmost to alienate, the affections of the French from their rightful sovereign; that he was, meditating the seizure of Alsace and Lorraine; that he was seeking to, reinstate De Choiseul, and convert France into a mere dependency upon, Austria.\\n\\nand in high satisfaction kicked his feet against the dash-board, and, watched the motion of the wheels. Now and then he vented his delight by, a broad smile, in which I could detect no trace of a suspicion as to my, rank of majesty. Finally I resolved to find out what place I occupied in, the estimation of an unfledged shoemaker; so I questioned him on the, subject. He contemplated me for a moment, and then said, `Perhaps you, might be an equerry?'--'Guess higher,' replied I. 'Well, a count?'--I, shook my head. 'Still higher.'--'A prince?'--'Higher yet.'--'Well\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty,\\\" said Etienne, in a voice choked with tears, \\\"you have, made my child famous. For a hundred years the honor you have conferred, upon him will be the wonder of our neighborhood, and never will the, people of Vitry forget the condescension of your majesty in sitting, among us as an equal and a guest. My son is a Frenchman at heart he, shall also be a German, like our own beautiful queen, who is both, Austrian and French. God bless and preserve you both! Long live our, queen, Marie Antoinette, and long live her noble brother, the Emperor of, Austria!\\\"\\n\\nand it is evident that Austrians are less corrupt than Frenchmen, for I, am told that Count von Mercy and Prince Kaunitz are au fait to every, thing that transpires in the palace here. Be that as it may, we intend, to follow the example of the queen. Our policy shall be so frank and, honorable that all the world may know it and welcome. But--it occurs to, me that the mistress of ceremonies is in great anguish of mind. She will, not recover her equanimity until she sees you again, count.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I see that they are watchful,\\\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, \\\"I see it., Do not deny it, you are one of those whose evil eyes see evil doings in, every impulse of my dear defenceless child's heart. But have a care, sir, cardinal, the friendless dauphiness will one day be Queen of France, and, she will then have it in her power to bring to justice those who, persecute her now!\\\" [Footnote: \\\"Memoires de Madame de Campan,\\\" vol. i.\\n\\n\\\"Why? Because I feel it my duty to leave nothing undone which can be, conducive to the interests and glory of our holy mother, the church.

I must see this, man who, from youth to old age, has defied the Lord of heaven and, earth!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, tell me, which of us is better calculated to reign in, Austria--Joseph or myself? Which of us will best promote the welfare of, the Austrian people? Do not answer me at once. Take time to reflect upon, the subject, for a, weighty question lies in the balance of this hour. I, cannot trust myself in this decision, for I have wept so many tears that, I have not the strength to see wherein my duty lies. I cannot even trust, my own misgivings, for pride or vanity may have blinded my eyes to, truth. I am not sure that I view things in their proper light. It is, useless, therefore, for me to speak. I desire to hear no one but, yourself. I swear to you by the memory of Charles V., that, whatever you, say shall be sacred; for I have exacted of you candor--and say what you, will, your candor shall not offend. Who, then, is best fitted to reign\\n\\nWith more activity than she bad been able to summon to her help since, the emperor's burial, Maria Theresa to her dressing-room, and snatching, up her long, black cloak, threw it around her person. As she was drawing, the hood over her face, she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror, close by. She was shocked at her own image; her face so corpse-like, her, cloak so like a hideous pall.\\n\\nThen she returned home, and, without a word, retired to her own, apartments. There, on a table, lay heaps of papers and letters with, unbroken seals. But the empress heeded nothing of all this. Maternity, reigned supreme in her heart--there was room in it for grief and remorse, alone. She strode to the window, and there, as she had done not many, days before, she looked out upon the gray towers of the chapel, and, thought how she had driven her own precious child into the dismal depths, of its loathsome vaults.\\n\\nAt Kaunitz's dinner-table on that day revelry reigned triumphant. No, jest was too bold for the lips of the men; and if perchance upon the, cheeks of their beautiful companions there rose the slightest flush of, womanly shame, the knights of the revel shouted applause, and pealed, forth their praises in wildest dithyrambics. With glowing faces and eyes, of flame they ate their highly-spiced viands, and drank their fiery, wines, until all restraint was flung aside, and madness ruled the hour.\\n\\n\\\"True, true,\\\" returned she, in an unsteady voice. \\\"Go, father, and begin, my work of reform, by casting out that wicked woman from among the, unhappy wives of Vienna. I myself will announce her departure to the, emperor. And now, dear friends, leave me. You, father, to Count, Bartenstein. Countess, recall Charlotte, and send me my tire-women. Let, the princes and princesses be regally attired to-day. I will meet the, emperor in their midst.\\\"\\n\\nI prayed that every obstacle might encumber his advance: and oh, my, beloved! when I heard that thou wert coming, I almost wished thee buried, under Alpine avalanches. When I was told of thy arrival, I longed to fly, away from Vienna, from rank and royalty, to some far country, some, secluded spot, where no reasons of state policy would force me to give, my hand to an unknown bride. Was I not a barbarian, sweetest, was I not, an arch-traitor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If Poland must succumb, I will act as becomes my station and, responsibilities as the sovereign of a great empire, and I will do that, which the wisdom and prudence of my mother shall dictate to her son.

Tell me that you love me as a woman ought to love, having no, God, no faith, no country, but her lover; losing her identity and living, for his happiness alone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have been profitable laborers to him, my lord. For several years, past, his corn-fields have been weighed down with golden tassels that, made the heart leap with joy at sight of their beauty. He had so much, that his barns would not hold it, and he had to put up other great, barns, thatched with straw, to shelter it. This year, it is true, he has, reaped nothing, but what of that? His barns are still full to, overflowing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you have heard that ridiculous story, which was invented by, Monsieur de Choiseul? Nobody here ever believed it; and let me tell you, that the Countess de Vergennes enjoys the esteem and consideration of, all who know her. Vergennes himself is a man of talent, and will do me, good service. The other ministers are: for the war department, Count de, Muy; for the minister of finance, instead of that hateful Abbe, Terray--(was not that the emperor's expression?)--I have chosen Count de, Clugny.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay, count I have given you a proof of my contempt, for I have, deliberately used you as a tool. You, the handsome and admired Count, Schulenberg--you who fancied you were throwing me the handkerchief of, your favor, you are nothing to me but the convenient implement of my, revenge. You came hither as my valet, and as I no longer need a valet, I, discharge you. You have served me well, and I thank you. You have done, admirably, for Dupont told me to-day that you had not yet exhausted the, money I gave you for the expenses of our journey.

The countess, when, questioned, answered unhesitatingly, that one half the sum she had won, at play, and the other half she had received as a present from Colonel, Szekuly. It was well known that Szekuly had not the means of bestowing, such princely gifts; yet, when informed of the countess's charge, he had, grown pale, but replied that the countess had spoken nothing but truth.\\n\\n\\\"Of course it is lost to her,\\\" replied Berth, enjoying the sudden, paleness which overspread the radiant face of Von Paradies. \\\"A girl who, sees has no right to the money which is given to the blind, and I heard, Von Stork this very day saying that as soon as it was proved that your, daughter could see, he intended to apply to the empress for her pension, in behalf of another party.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am a simpleton,\\\" thought she. \\\"I must forget the dreams of a, delirious nun. How could I be so weak as to imagine that God would, permit an hysterical invalid to prophesy to a sound and strong woman, like myself? I will speak with Father Gassner. Perhaps he may see the, future differently. If he does, I shall know that they are both false, prophets, and their prophecies I shall throw to the winds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see that your majesty is displeased,\\\" replied Lacy, sadly, \\\"and that, you reckon me among your opponents--I who am struck with admiration at, the grandeur of your conceptions. But you are so filled with the, rectitude of your intentions, that you have no indulgence for the, weakness and ignorance of those whom you would benefit, and you snake, too light of the enmity of those whom your reforms have aggrieved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am tired of life and of the world, and I intend to take refuge from, their troubles in a cloister. Say no more! I am resolved to go, and the, palace at Innspruck shall be my convent. There, on the spot where he, died, will I make my vows; and as an abbess will I spend my life praying, that God may give him eternal rest.

Let the steward select, the rarest wines in the cellar. Tell him to see that the Champagne is, not too warm, nor the Johannisberg to cold; the Sillery too dry, nor the, Lachryma Christi too acid. Order two carriages, and send one for Signora, Ferlina, and the other for Signora Sacco. Send two footmen to Counts, Harrach and Colloredo, with my compliments. Stay--here is a list of the, other guests. Send a messenger to the apartments of my sister, the, countess. Tell her, with my respects, to oblige me by dining to-day in, her own private rooms. I will not need her to preside over my, dinner-table to-day.\\\"\\n\\nWhen he recovered enough to sit up, still his mother would not consent, for him to leave her room for his own. As long as he was an invalid, he, should be hers alone. In her room, and through her loving care, should, he find returning health. His sisters and brothers assembled there to, cheer him with their childish mirth, and his young friend, Dominick, Kaunitz, came daily to entertain him with his lively gossip. Altogether\\n\\n\\\"Pray give me your arm. I have but one more observation to make. I hope, that you will now be able to prove substantially to the emperor that it, was quite useless for him to shelter himself behind the words, 'I shall, claim thee in heaven!' But if I may presume so far, I request that you, will defer these demonstrations until I return from Rome with my letters, of divorce.\\\"\\n\\nFor some time the empress walked up and down her room, undecided whether, to turn the sibylline leaves or not. It might be sinful to question, it, might be fatal to remain ignorant. Was it, or was it not the will of, God, that she should pry into the great mystery of futurity? Surely it, could not be sinful, else why should He have given to His servants the, gift of prophecy?\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, I know something of the vanity of authors,\\\" said the empress., \\\"They imagine themselves to be Atlas, each one with the world upon his, shoulders, which must certainly fall, if they are not there to uphold, it. I, however, take the liberty of judging that if they were all to be, blown to atoms, nobody would be the worse for their disappearance. What, has come of your writings? A paper war of such dimensions, that I think, the foul fiend must have plucked all the geese in Avernus, and have, thrown their quills at your heads. What with your imbecile pens, nobody, knows who is right!\\\"\\n\\nproud, triumphant empress, who in the eyes of her people was both, beautiful and beloved. For the moment her widow's sorrows were, forgotten; and when surrounded by so many loyal hearts, she sank on her, knees before the altar of St. Stephen, she thanked God for the joy of, this hour, and made a vow that her whole life should be devoted to the, welfare of the people who on this day had given her so touching a, welcome.\\n\\nThe dessert was on the table. The guests were indulging themselves in, some of those post-prandial effusions which are apt to blossom from, heads overheated by wine, and are generally richer in words than in, wisdom. The host, with flattering preliminaries, had proposed the health, of the ladies, and every goblet sparkled to the brim. Just at that, moment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear., He turned, smiling to his guests and, apologizing for the interruption\\n\\nOn the evening of which we speak, the empress was at the card-table. But, those great, glowing eyes were roving from one side of the room to the, other in restless anxiety. Sometimes, for a moment, they rested upon the, emperor who was standing near the table in conversation with some, provincial nobleman. The cheerful and unconcerned demeanor of her son, seemed to reassure the empress, who turned to her cards, and tried to, become interested in the game. Not far off, the archduchesses, too, were, at cards, and the hum of conversation subsided almost to a whisper, that, the imperial party might not be disturbed. Gradually the empress became, absorbed in her cards, so that she was unobservant of the entrance of, one of the emperor's lords in waiting who whispered something in, Joseph's ear, whereupon the latter left the room in haste.\\n\\n\\\"I speak of Madame Etiquette, your majesty. She is a stiff and tiresome, old dame, I grant you, but in France she presides over every thing., Without her the royal family can neither sleep nor wake; they can, neither take a meal if they be in health, nor a purge if they be, indisposed, without her everlasting surveillance. She directs their, dress, amusements, associates, and behavior; she presides over their, pleasures, their weariness, their social hours, and their hours of, solitude. This may be uncomfortable, but royalty cannot escape it, and, it must he endured.\\\"\\n\\nMarie Antoinette recovered her self-possession, and looked with perfect, serenity toward the high and mighty duchess, whose titles were being, pompously enumerated by the punctilious mistress of ceremonies. As ill, luck would have it, this one was older, uglier, and more strangely, bedizened than all the others together. The queen felt a spasmodic, twitch of her face; she colored violently, and opening her fan again, it, was evident to all that assemblage of censorious dames that for the, second time youth and animal spirits had prevailed over decorum.\\n\\n\\\"Let her remain, your majesty,\\\" cried Joseph with a burst of wrath, \\\"she, is in her proper place. But if she means to kneel until she has obtained, my forgiveness, let her kneel throughout all eternity! I consented to, this marriage for expediency's sake, and I would have done my best to, make the burden as light for us both as lay in my power. Your majesty, knows how she has deceived me; you have heard her pitiful lie with its, pitiful excuse. I might have forgiven her for marrying me, with her, disgusting disease, but for being a liar--never!\\\"\\n\\nPrince Kaunitz was in his cabinet. Baron Binder was reading aloud the, secret dispatches which had just come in from the Austrian ambassador at, Berlin, the young Baron van Swieten. Meanwhile, Kaunitz was busy with a, brush of peacock's feathers, dusting the expensive trifles that covered, his escritoire, or polishing its ebony surface with a fine silk, handkerchief which he kept for the purpose. This furbishing of trinkets, and furniture was a private pastime with the all-powerful minister; and, many a personage of rank was made to wait in the anteroom, while he, finished his dusting or rearranged his bijouterie, until it was grouped, to his satisfaction.\\n\\nas far as she is able, assimilate herself to the customs and language of, her people. With that intention, Prince Kaunitz has commissioned the, Duke de Choiseul to select you a new teacher. He will be accompanied by, two French ladies of honor. These people, my dear, are to form your, manners according to the requirements of court etiquette in France; but, in your heart, my child, I trust that you will always be an Austrian., That you may not be too French, Gluck will continue to give you music, lessons. I flatter myself that the French cannot compete with us in, music. Study well, and try to deserve the brilliant destiny in store for, you.\\\"\\n\\nShe received the two travellers with much grace and affability; and, whereas the curates were to have been placed beside her at table, she, assigned them to her husband, and invited the strangers to the seats, instead. She informed them of the names and station of every person, present, and then related to them how the winter previous, at the ball, of the sub-prefect, she had danced the whole evening, while some of the, prettiest girls in the room had wanted partners.\\n\\nThe ceremonial was over. The empress herself had conducted the young, Queen of Rome to her apartments; and she had stood by her side, while, her tire-woman exchanged her dress of golden tissue for a light white, negligee of finest cambric trimmed with costly lace. With her own hand, Maria Theresa unfastened the myrtle-wreath and coronet of diamonds that, encircled her daughter-in-law's brow. She then kissed Josepha, affectionately, and, bidding her good-night, she besought the blessing, of God upon both her children.\\n\\nA brilliant crowd thronged the apartments of the Princess d'Artois. The, royal family, the court, and the lords and ladies of high rank were, assembled in her reception-rooms, for close by an event of highest, importance to France was about to transpire. The princess was giving, birth to a scion of royalty. The longings of France were about to be, fulfilled--the House of Bourbon was to have an heir to its greatness.\\n\\n\\\"No commonplaces, Quarin, no equivocation,\\\" cried Joseph, impatiently., \\\"I must have the truth, do you hear me?--the truth. I cannot afford to, be surprised by death, for I must provide for a nation, and my house, must be set in order. I am not afraid of death, my friend; it comes to, me in the smiling guise of a liberator. Therefore be frank, and tell the, at once whether my malady is dangerous.\\\"\\n\\nbounding higher and higher up the icy steeps of this cheerless world?, Oh, Therese, why did I not find you in the early years of life? And yet, I thank Heaven that you are mine for these few fleeting moments, for, they have taken me back to the days of my youth and its beautiful, illusions! Ah, Therese, from the first hour when I beheld you advancing, on your father's arm to greet me, proud as an empress, calm as a vestal\\n\\n\\\"When the need of the people will be so great that they will part with, their last acre of land or last handful of gold for a few bushels of, grain.

This is the second party who intrigue against the, dauphiness.--Madame Sophie perchance remembers her in her prayers; but, she is too pious to be of use to anybody. Madame Victoire, who really, loves the dauphiness, is so sickly, that she scarcely ever leaves her, room. For a while she held little reunions there, which, being very, pleasant, were for a while attended by the dauphiness; but Madame de, Noailles objected, and court etiquette required that they should be, discontinued.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would prefer that you considered yourself wholly the subject of my, daughter; as I doubt whether she will ever find much loyalty in your, heart, prince.

I am not aware that we are in the carnival; nor have I an, unmarried daughter for whom any French prince can have sent you to, propose. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"How very fortunate it is that this particular piece of land should, belong to Austria!\\\" said the king; with a slight sneer. \\\"You see that, Poland, who for so many centuries had supposed herself to be the, rightful owner of the Zips, has, in virtue of such ownership, projected, beyond the Carpathian Mountains quite to the interior of Hungary. Now a, wedge of that sort is inconvenient, perhaps dangerous, and it is lucky, for Austria that she has found out her right of possession in that, quarter. It not only contracts her neighbor's domains, but essentially, increases her own. It now concerns Austria to prove to Europe her right, to this annexation, for Europe is somewhat astonished to hear of it. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"So much the better.

Why is that Joseph so niggardly that one cannot feel the, slightest interest in him? If after refusing all other invitations he, had paid me the compliment of accepting mine--but, no!--this haughty, Austrian treats me with as little consideration as be does the rest of, the world; and forces me, in spite of myself, to the side of Frederick., But there I find Orloff and Panin, and we cannot work together.

It being, only a princess who was in labor, and not a queen, none but the royal, family and the ministers were admitted into her bedchamber. The, aristocracy waited in the reception-rooms, the people in the corridors, and galleries. Had it been Marie Antoinette, all the doors would have, been thrown open to her subjects. The fishwives of Paris, the laborers\\n\\nWhile the King of Prussia had been advancing, the people in silence were, revolving in their minds the blood, the treasure, the long years of, struggle which Austrians had owed to this warlike Frederick. But when, they saw how Joseph greeted him, they forgot every thing, and he now, seemed to their excited imaginations to come like a resplendent sun of, peace, whose rays streamed far into the distance of a happy and, prosperous futurity.\\n\\n\\\"He did; and however disinclined I might be to accept his invitation, I, have come lest he should suppose that I am afraid to encounter his eagle, eyes.

It is expedient for the, present that Austria and Prussia should be quasi allies, for in this way, peace has been secured to Europe. But my system of diplomacy, which the, empress has made her own, forbids me to make any permanent alliance with, a prince who lives politically from hand to mouth, and has no fixed line, of policy.

The empress looked keenly at, herself in the glass, and convinced that she really looked well, she, called imperatively for her tire-women. In came the procession, bearing, pooped-skirt rich-embroidered train, golden-flowered petticoat, and, bodice flashing with diamonds. But the empress, usually so affable at, her toilet, surveyed both maids and apparel with gloomy indifference. In, moody silence she reached out her feet, while her slippers were, exchanged for high-heeled shoes. Not a look had she to bestow upon the, magnificent dress which enhanced a thousandfold her mature beauty., Without a word she dismissed the maids of honor, all except Charlotte\\n\\nhow Maria Theresa hates vice, and how she punishes crime, without, respect of persons.

She took, no notice of the breach of etiquette of which Antoinette was guilty, in, rushing unannounced upon her solitude. Her eyes were fixed upon the, chapel of the Capuchins in whose vaults lay so many whom she had loved., Her heart and thoughts were within those gray walls, now with her, husband and her dead children, now with Josepha, for whom she felt pang, after pang of anxiety. In an absent tone she turned and said:\\n\\nThe emperor made no reply, but rode cu, relaxing his speed until his, horse ambled gently over the road. \\\"Lacy,\\\" said he, finally, \\\"I am, unreasonable when I murmur against destiny, for yesterday Providence was, most benign toward me.

From early morning the archduchesses at the palace had, been practising a lyric drama from the pen of Metastasio called \\\"Il, Parnasso Confuso.\\\" The music was by Gluck, and his deep bass was heard, accompanying the sweet rich voices of the bridegroom's sisters. They had, studied their parts diligently, and felt quite confident of success, as, they gathered around the maestro. But Gluck was never satisfied, and he, kept Apollo and the Muses at their music-lesson until their ladies of, honor were obliged to inform them that they must positively retire to, their toilets, a courier having arrived to say that the princess had, entered the gates of the city.\\n\\n\\\"How will she receive me?\\\" thought he. \\\"They say that she is sadly, changed, and that her father would scarcely know his beautiful child, again. Oh, my child, will I be able to bear the sight of your grief, without falling at your feet, and acknowledging my guilt? But pshaw! She, is safe now. I shall take her home; and for every tear that she has, shed, I will give her a diamond bright as a star She shall have gold\\n\\n\\\"My imperial sovereign will never consent to have a Russian province, contiguous to Austria; and should Moldavia and Wallachia be governed by, hospodars and petty despots, their pretended independence would soon, melt away into a Russian dependency. Austria, too, would esteem it a, great misfortune if Russia should come into possession of the Crimea and, the Black Sea. Her dominion over the Black Sea would be more dangerous, to Europe than an extension of her territory. Nothing, in short, would, be so fatal to that independence which is dear to all nations, as the, cession of this important outlet to Russia.\\\" [Footnote: The prince's, own words.

Oh, when will the hour of retribution sound?\\\"\\n\\nNot one of the royal family had followed the body. The king was at, Choisy, and all hearts were turned to him. Thousands of men went in and, out of the palace, each one with his burden of fears, hopes, uneasiness, or expectations. Who was now to find favor at court! Would it be the, queen, or the aunts of the king? What fate awaited Du Barry? Who would, be prime minister?\\n\\nfor this is Austrian soil, and no one reigns in Austria but Maria, Theresa. The Jesuits have been a blessing to mankind; they have, instructed our youth, and have been the guardians of all knowledge; they, have encouraged the arts and sciences, and have disseminated the, Christian faith in every part of the world. They have been the true and, loyal friends of my house; and in their day of adversity, though I may, not defend them against their ecclesiastical superiors, I will protect, them against malice and insult.\\\"\\n\\nHere and there an isolated voice was raised to protest against the, stupendous robbery; but it was lost amidst the clash of arms and the, tread of soldiery. Whenever a word was spoken that fretted the, sensibilities of Austria or Prussia, Catharine said she was willing to, bear all the blame of the thing; and, laughing heartily, she called the, protests that were sent on the subject, \\\"moutarde apres diner.\\\", Frederick resorted to self-deception, proclaiming to the world, \\\"that, for the first tune the King and the Republic of Poland were established, on a firm basis; that they could now apply themselves in peace to the, construction of such a government as would tend to preserve the balance, of power between proximate nations, and prevent them from clashing.\\\", [Footnote: Raumer, \\\"Contributions,\\\" p. 542.]\\n\\nand as he was expressing his sympathy, the archduchess interrupted him, with a laugh. 'Believe me,' said she, 'for a princess of forty, who is, an old maid, even a hole in her own cheek is a godsend. Nothing that, varies the dull uniformity of my life comes amiss.'\\\" [Footnote: The, archduchess's own words. See \\\"Courts of Europe at the Close of the Last, Century,\\\" by Henry Swinburne, vol. i., p. 342.]\\n\\nThe imperial cortege, then, was just about to pass from Germany to, France. It was evening, and the fiery gold of the setting sun was, mirrored in the waves of the Rhine which with gentle murmur were toying, with the greensward that sloped gracefully down to the water's edge. The, emperor gave the word to halt, and rising from his seat, looked back, upon the long line of carriages that followed in his wake.\\n\\n\\\"My dear son,\\\" said the empress, \\\"I cannot view this undertaking with, your eyes; I am old and timid, and I shudder with apprehension of the, demon that follows in the wake of ambition. I would not descend to my, grave amid the wails and curses of my people--I would not be depicted, in history as an ambitious and unscrupulous sovereign. Let me go to my, Franz blessed by the tears and regrets of my subjects--let me appear, before posterity as an upright and peace-loving empress. But I have said, that I am old--so old that I mistrust my own judgment. It may be that I, mistake pusillanimity for disinterestedness. Speak, Kaunitz--so far you, have been silent. What says your conscience to this claim? Is it, consistent with justice and honor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well! you ugly old woman,\\\" said she aloud, \\\"we have begun our, acquaintance. Let us be good friends. I do not intend to make one effort, to lessen your ugliness by womanly art; I must seek to win its pardon, from the world by noble deeds and a well-spent life. Perhaps, in future, days, when my subjects lament my homeliness, they may add that, nevertheless I was a GOOD, and--well! in this hour of humiliation we may, praise one another, I think--perchance a GREAT sovereign.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he certainly is the most condescending and humane prince that I, ever heard of,\\\" thought Monsieur Louis, as the emperor's carriage drove, off. \\\"And one thing is certain--I shall be careful whom I give him for, neighbors. I do not believe a word of what the Count de Provence's valet, says, that he wants to take Alsace and Lorraine, and has come to France, to change the ministry. The king's brothers are not over-fond of the, queen nor of the emperor but the people love them, and everybody in, Paris envies me, now that I have the great emperor as my guest.\\\"\\n\\nTherese had no strength to retort. She hung down her head, and large, scalding tears fell from her eyes. Count Kinsky placed her in the, carriage, closed the door, and then returned to his own, travelling-chariot, which was a few paces behind. The two equipages, thundered down the streets together, but at the gates they parted, the, one taking the road for Hungary, the other for Rome. [Footnote: This, whole story is Historical. The \\\"heavenly Therese,\\\" as she is called by, Hormayer, was really married and thus abandoned by her husband, who, persisted in believing that the connection between herself and the, emperor was not guiltless. But the count met with no success in the, matter of the divorce. The pope refused.]\\n\\n\\\"Since such is your faith in me, my Egeria, you will then have courage, to hear what I have to tell. Tear away the laurel-wreaths from my past, works, Marianne--burn them to ashes. They are dust and to dust they will, surely return. Their mirth and their melody, their pomp and their, pathos, are all lies. They are not the true children of, inspiration--they are impostors. They are the offspring of our affected, and falsely sentimental times, and deserve not immortality. Away with, them! A new day shall begin for me, or I shall hide my head in bitter, solitude, despising my race, who applaud the juggler, and turn away in, coldness from the veritable artiste.\\\"\\n\\nHe then turned to the emperor, and presenting the young Prince of, Prussia and the two Princes of Brunswick, he pointed to the white, uniforms which they wore, and said: \\\"Sire, I bring you some new, recruits. [Footnote: The king wore the Austrian uniform, embroided with, silver. The princes and the king's suite also wore it.] We are all, desirous of serving under your banner. And we feel that it would be an, honor,\\\" continued he, looking around the square, \\\"to be the, companions-in-arms of your majesty's soldiers, for each man looks like a, true son of Mars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will have to go to the kitchen, sir. There you will find a flitch, of bacon. Cut off some slices, put them in a pan you will see there, and, set it on the fire. My neighbor has just now made some for poor John., Then look on the dresser and take some milk and a little flour. Make a, batter of them with the eggs, pour it upon your bacon, and when the eggs, are done, the omelet is made. It is the easiest thing in the world.\\\"\\n\\nTo this the king bowed in silence. He was so weary of his walk that he, led the way to a road by which a short-cut might be made to the palace., This road was crossed by an avenue of trees which bordered a large iron, gate leading to the front entrance of the palace. Here the people were, accustomed to assemble to obtain a view of their sovereigns; and to-day, the throng was greater than usual, for they had learned from the Swiss, guard that the two monarchs were out together, and thousands of eager, eyes were watching for the glittering uniforms of the gardes de corps.\\n\\nOne speculating jeweller, alone, honored the memory of the deceased, king, and made his fortune thereby. He manufactured a mourning, snuff-box, of black shagreen, whose lid was ornamented with a portrait, of the queen. He called his boxes \\\"La consolation, dans le, chagrin,\\\"[Footnote: \\\"Mbmoires de Madame de Campan\\\" vol. i., p. 91.] and, his portrait and pun became so popular, that in less than a week he had, sold a hundred thousand of these boxes.[Footnote: This word \\\"chagrin,\\\", signifies not only grief, but also that preparation of leather, which\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" cried he, \\\"from this day you shall be better pleased than you, have been with me of late--I have seen your reproving looks--nay, do, not deny it, for they have been as significant as words; and if I made, no answer, it was perhaps because I was guilty, and had nothing to say., You have sighed over my dejection for months past, dear friend, but it, has vanished with the tidings I have just received I am ready to rush, out into the storm, bold and defiant as Ajax!\\\"\\n\\nand many of the ladies had their handkerchiefs to their eyes. Everybody, was touched except Professor Barth. He, on the contrary, was chuckling, with satisfaction, and felt much more inclined to applaud than to, commiserate. He looked at Ingenhaus, who, not being in the secret, was, divided between sympathy for the father and indignation toward the, charlatan. Indeed, he had so far forgotten his own interest in the, scene, that he was weeping with the rest.\\n\\n\\\"Louis was not born like his predecessors, and it is generally believed, that he will not die a natural death. Not a single member of the royal, family was present at his birth. When, overtaken by the pangs of, childbirth, his mother was accidentally alone in the palace of, Versailles; and the heir of France, upon his entrance into life, was, received by some insignificant stranger. The courier who was sent to, announce his birth fell from his horse and was killed on the spot. The, Abbe de Saujon, who was called in to christen the infant, was struck by, apoplexy while entering the chapel door, and his arm and tongue were, paralyzed. [Footnote: \\\"Memoires de Madame de Creque,\\\" vol. iii., p., 179.] From hundreds of healthy women the physician of the dauphiness, chose three nurses for the prince. At the end of a week two of them were, dead, and the third one, Madame Guillotine, after nursing him for six, weeks, was carried of by small-pox. Even the frivolous grandfather was, terrified by such an accumulation of evil omens, and he was heard to, regret that he had given to his grandson the title of Duke de Berry\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the princess, passionately, \\\"and look at me. You have known, me since my infancy, dear friend, therefore you need not flatter me, because of my station. Look at me, and tell me if it is not enough to, break my heart, that I must appear before this beautiful empress and her, daughters, and that I must try to win the affections of this prince, the, glance of whose eye is enough to kindle love in the heart of every woman, living--oh say, and speak without reserve--tell me if a woman so, obscure, so ignorant, and so destitute of charms, can ever hope to be, loved or cherished by such a family?\\\"\\n\\nThe feast was at an end, and as Kaunitz reviewed the faces of the, company and saw that for the day their passions were weary from, indulgence, he said to himself, with diabolical calmness: \\\"Now that they, have exhausted every other pleasure, we will sharpen the blunted edge of, desire with gambling! When the life of the heart is burnt to ashes, it, will still revive at the chink of gold.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor laughed a sardonic laugh. \\\"What need have I of a state, councillor, I who am but a puppet in the hands of my mother, I who must, stand, with shackled arms, and look on while she reigns? But it is in, vain to murmur. I watch and wait; and while I wait, I find myself, inclining fast to your policy. I believe you to be an honorable, statesman, and I believe also that the course you have pursued, you have, chose because you are convinced that it is wise.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor laughed again. \\\"What do you fear, my friend?\\\" asked he., \\\"Have you so long shared with me my burden of dissimulation, that you, are frightened to see our shackles fall? Are you afraid of the fresh, air, because we wear our masks no longer? Patience, Rosenberg, and al, will be well with us. Our dreams are about to be fulfilled: what we have, whispered together in the twilight of mutual trust, we may now cry out, with free and joyous shouts--'Reform! reform!' My people have prayed, quite enough, they shall now learn to do something better--they shall, think; they have been long enough led by faith, like little children. I, will give them confirmation, and they shall enter upon the, responsibilities of manhood. I mean to be a blessing to the virtuous\\n\\n\\\"She will surely be there before many hours. Solitude is not congenial, to Maria Theresa's heart; her active mind craves occupation, and her, grief requires it. Let us appeal to her affections through the illness, of her child, and complete reaction will ensue. If once we can persuade, her to quit her seclusion, the cloister-dream is over. Let us all work, in concert to restore her to the world. It is not the sovereign of a, great nation who has a right like Mary to sit at the feet of Jesus. Go, at once, Count Bathiany, and may God bless the efforts we are making to, restore our empress to her sense of duty. Church and state are alike, endangered by the fatal step she has taken.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know it, poor man; he is at the top and bottom of all the trouble. I, beseech you, chere Anna, let us put aside politics; I cannot see what, pleasure a woman can find in such tiresome things. Mon Dieu, there are, so many other things more pleasing as well as more important! For, instance: how do people pass their time in Vienna? Have you many lovers?, Do you go to many balls?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The people of Bavaria well know what is to be their fate if they fall, into the hands of the elector palatine. Surrounded by mistresses with, swarms of natural children, his sole object in life will be to plunder, his subjects that he may enrich a progeny to whom he can lave neither, name nor crown. Oh, your majesty, be generous, and rescue the Bavarians, from a war of succession; for the elector palatine has no heir, and his, death will be the signal for new strife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" said the banker, advancing with his flambeau. Podstadsky, hesitated. If his sense of honor was dead, his vanity was not; and it, winced at the slightest touch of ridicule. Was there no escape from this, absurd escort? He looked around and saw no hope of rescue. Behind him, Rachel had locked the door, and the servants were so closely ranged, together that it was vain to attempt a passage through that living wall, of fire. He had no alternative but to laugh derisively and step into the, ranks. The procession moved on, and gathered strength as it moved; for, on the staircase in the lower hall, and at the front of the house, they, were joined by throng after throng, each man of which, like the, commander-in-chief, was armed with a flambeau. This was bad enough of, itself, but the count's body-guard were all in a titter, and every man, enjoyed the jest except himself.\\n\\n\\\"They have passed by,\\\" exclaimed he joyfully. \\\"This day is mine, and I, am free. What a charm is in that word FREEDOM! I feel it now; no emperor, am I, but a man, to whom the animals will turn their backs, without, suspecting that they refuse to look upon an anointed sovereign. But, hark! what is that? A doe--a timid doe--perhaps an enchanted princess, who can resume her shape at the bidding of a prince only. Here am I\\n\\n\\\"No, mother,\\\"' said Joseph, \\\"it is I who should sue for pardon. My heart, is wild and stubborn; but I believe that it beats with a love as true, and warm for my empress as that of any other man in Austria. Have, patience with me, then, my mother, for I am indeed a wandering bird;, and, in my wild flight, the shafts of this life have wounded and maimed, me. But let us not speak of life--mine is a blasted one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very true, Gunther, but I cannot invite the Muses into my study. A, prince has no right to associate with such frivolous ladies, for he is, not on earth to pass away time. The King of Prussia heads a royal sect, who devote themselves to authorship. The Empress of Russia follows after, him with Voltaire in her hand. I cannot emulate their literary, greatness. I read to learn, and travel to enlarge my ideas; and I, flatter myself that as I encourage men of letters, I do them a greater, service than I would, were I to sit at a desk and help them to weave, sonnets. [Footnote: The emperor's own words. \\\"Letters of Joseph,\\\" p., 67.] So let us eschew Apollo and his light-footed companions; I aim to, be nothing but an imperial statesman. But,\\\" continued the emperor\\n\\nPotemkin, without any appearance of surprise, took it and broke the, seal. The king began by saying that he had every reason to believe that, the object of Joseph's visit to Russia was to alienate Russia from her, old ally. Then he went jnto ecstasies over the genius and statesmanship, of Potemkin, and besought him to uphold the interests of Prussia., Furthermore he promised his interest and influence to the prince, not, only for the present, but for the future, when it was probable that he, (Frederick) could serve Potemkin substantially. [Footnote: This letter, is historical, and is to be found in Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i., p. 412.]\\n\\nIn vain her confessor and her attendants strove to awaken her interest, to the dissatisfaction of the people with the wild projects of reform, that threatened the subversion of all social order. From the day of her, retirement, Maria Theresa had forbidden the slightest allusion to, politics. Her confesser had on one occasion ventured a hint on the, subject of the changes which were being made by the emperor, but the, empress had turned her flashing eyes upon him, and had reminded him, that, as the servant of the Lord, he was there to exhort and to pray\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty has given orders, that as soon as the event, which is, about to take place, has occurred, the whole court shall leave, Versailles for Choisy. Now it would not be possible to issue verbal, orders in such a moment as the one which we await; so that the master of, the horse and myself had agreed upon a signal by which the matter could, be arranged without speech. The garden du corps, pages, equerries\\n\\nWhenever Joseph awaked from his fever-dreams and unclosed his eyes, there, close to his bedside he saw the empress, who greeted him with, loving words and softest caresses. Whenever, in his fever-thirst, he, called for drink, her hand held the cup to his parched lips; and, whenever that soft, cool hand was laid upon his hot brow, he felt as if, its touch chased away all pain and soothed all sorrow.\\n\\nNot with his usual stateliness, but panting, almost running, did Kaunitz, traverse the gilded halls of his own palace, which were open to-day in, honor of the empress's recovery, and were already festive with the sound, of the guests assembling to a magnificent dinner which was to celebrate, the event. Without a word to the Countess Clary, who came forward, elegantly attired for the occasion, Kaunitz flew to his study, and, sinking into an arm-chair, he covered his face with his hands. He felt, as if he had been face to face with death. That was not his beautiful\\n\\nA breathless silence followed these bitter words. The emperor, in, confusion, withdrew behind the harpsichord. The archduke looked, perfectly indifferent. While Count Bathiany had been repeating his, words, his face had slightly flushed; but when he heard the sharp, reproof of his mother, he raised his head, and gave her back another, defiant look. With the same sullen haughtiness, he stared first at one, accuser, and then at another, while each one in his turn gave judgment, against him. First, and most vehement in his denunciations, was Count, Bartenstein. He denounced the archduke as idle and inattentive. He never, would have any political sagacity whatever. Why, even the great work, in, fifteen folios, which he (Count Bartenstein) had compiled from the, imperial archives for the especial instruction of the prince, even THAT, failed to interest him! [Footnote: Hormayer says that this book was, heavy and filled with tiresome details. (No wonder! In fifteen, folios.--Trane.)]\\n\\nA half year had passed away. The deputation from the Netherlands had, visited Vienna, and had been deeply impressed with the affability of the, emperor. They returned home, taking with them his assurance that their, time-honored usages should be respected, and that Joseph himself would be, the guardian of their ancient rights. He merely desired to free them, from \\\"certain abuses which in the lapse of time had crept into their, constitution.\\\" To this end he promised that an imperial delegation, should visit Brussels to consult with the states.\\n\\nPodstadsky, of course, was assailed with questions in relation to the, countess. He had known her in Italy as the wife of a wealthy old, nobleman to whom her parents had sacrificed her before she was eighteen., She had been sincerely admired in Rome, not only on account of her, beauty, but of her wit, goodness, and above all of her admirable, behavior toward her repulsive old husband. Her conduct had been so, exemplary that she had been called \\\"La contessa del cuore freddo.\\\", [Footnote: The countess with the cold heart.] Podstadsky confessed that, even he had been desperately in love with her, but finding her, unapproachable, had left Rome in despair. What then was his delight, when, a few moments ago, he had learned from her own lips that she was a, widow, and had come to spend a season in Vienna!\\n\\n\\\"Never! Austria cannot indulge such vain hopes, for her watchful spies, must ere this have convinced the Hapsburgs that my dislike toward this, duke, so precious in the eyes of Maria Theresa, is unconquerable. My, father's shade banished him to Chanteloup, and I will follow this shade, whithersoever it leads. If my father had lived (and perchance Choiseul, had a hand in his death) there would have been no alliance of France, with Austria. I am forced to maintain it, since my wife is the daughter, of Maria Theresa; so that neither the Austrian nor the anti-Austrian, party can ever hope to rule in France. Marie Antoinette is the wife of, my heart, and no human being shall ever dislodge her thence. But my love, for her can never influence my policy, which is steadfast to the, principles of my father. If Joseph has come hither for political, purposes, he might have spared his pains.\\\"\\n\\nThe festivities of the first day were concluded with a ballet. Great, preparations had been made for the reception of the King of Prussia., Noverre with his dancers, and Florian Gassman with his opera corps had, been summoned to Neustadt. They came in twenty wagons laden with, scenery, coulisses, machinery, and costumes, all of which was intended, to prove to Frederick that, although the court of Berlin was the, acknowledged seat of literature and the fine arts, Vienna was not, altogether forsaken by the Muses.\\n\\nLouis appeared to have no greater happiness than that which he found in, his wife's society. They were often seen wandering in the shady walks of, the palace gardens, talking, jesting, and laughing together, as might, have done any other young couple, unencumbered by the burden of royalty., It had even happened to Louis to steal an arm around the graceful form, of the queen, and once or twice to bestow a shy kiss upon her ivory, shoulders.\\n\\n\\\"Is that your sorrow, my child?\\\" exclaimed the empress. \\\"Joseph is like, his father; he loves wealth. The emperor had proposed this half-brother, of the King of Sardinia for you, Christina, but I refused my consent;, and, now without my knowledge, Joseph would force him upon you, because, of his great riches. But patience, patience, my daughter. I will show, you that I am not so powerless as you think; I will show you that no one, in Austria shall give away my Christina without her mother's, approbation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is with feelings of profound regret that I find myself forced to, decline your majesty's most friendly offers of mediation with Turkey. I, am obliged to unsheathe my sword, and I shall not return it to the, scabbard until it shall have won full reparation for all the wrongs, sustained by my forefathers at the hands of the Porte. Your majesty is a, monarch, and as such, you are acquainted with the rights of kings. And, is this undertaking of mine against Turkey any thing more than an, attempt to resume the rights of which my throne has been dispossessed?\\n\\nLacy bowed, and followed the grand duke in silence. The emperor, retreated to his cabinet, and, sinking upon a sofa, buried his face in, his hands. Nothing interrupted the stillness save the measured footsteps, of Lacy and the grand duke, who entered and closed the door behind them., A long pause ensued. The grand duke retired to a window, where, with his, arms folded, he awaited the development of affairs with recovered, composure. Joseph still sat with his face hidden by his hands, while, Lacy with military decorum stood at the door with his letters, silent, until the emperor should signify that he might read. Finding that Joseph, would not speak, Lacy took a few steps forward. \\\"Does your majesty allow, me to read the letters which, in the name of the empress, his imperial, highness, the grand duke, has delivered to me?\\\"\\n\\nI shall give it; but I think that my Maker will not love me the less for, having, voluntarily, felt the pangs of hunger for once in my life. I can, never forget this day in Bohemia; it has confirmed my resolution to, reign for the good of my people alone, and as God hears me, they shall, be happy when I govern them.--But your chicken is ready. To satisfy, you, I will go and beg my supper in yonder village, and, as there are, enough of you to attend to these poor sufferers, I will take Lacy to, keep me company. Come, Lacy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They deserve nothing better,\\\" replied Kaunitz, with his usual phlegm., \\\"They are thankless children whom he can win who feeds them with sugar., Your majesty, perhaps, has not sufficiently conciliated their weakness., You have been too honest in your opposition to their rotten privileges., Had you undermined the Joycuse Entree by degrees, it would have fallen, of itself. But you have attempted to blow it up, and the result is that, these Belgian children cry out that the temple of liberty is on fire\\n\\nIT was the hour of dinner. Complete silence reigned throughout the, imperial palace, except in the halls and stairways that led from the, imperial dining-hall to the kitchens below. Both lay far from the, apartments of the empress-abbess. She, therefore, felt that she could, visit her child without fear of observation. She had just concluded her, own solitary dinner, and was trying to collect her thoughts for prayer., In vain. They WOULD wander to the sick-bed of her daughter, whom fancy, pictured dying without the precious cares that a mother's hand alone is, gifted to bestow. Maria Theresa felt that her heart was all too, storm-tossed for prayer. She closed her book with a pang of, self-reproach, and rose from her arm-chair.\\n\\n\\\"Sire,\\\" said Kaunitz, proudly, \\\"there may be times when it is the part, of wisdom to be silent; but it is never permitted to a man of honor to, be untruthful. I know nothing of this girl's disappearance. The most, that I anticipated was a forced marriage. This, I knew, would occasion, new differences between the empress and your majesty, and I had supposed, that you were coming to me to call for my mediation.\\\"\\n\\nIt was dusk, and Giuseppe, with a travelling carriage, once more awaited, his mistress at the corner of the street. There remained nothing to do, now but to remove the coffer from its hiding-place, and that was the, work of half an hour. Arabella had the key of the little postern, and, there was no danger of spies, for the house was empty. Having avowed, herself to be the pensioned mistress of Podstadsky, the law had placed, its seal upon her effects, and they were all to be sold for the benefit, of the count's creditors.\\n\\nFor a few days past, the Archduchess Christina had absented herself from, this mournful levee. On the first day of her nonappearance the empress, had not appeared to remark her absence. But on the second day her eyes, wandered sadly from her prayer book to her children, and her lips seemed, ready to frame some question. Instead of speaking, she bent her head, over her rosary, and strove to pray with more devotion than usual.\\n\\n\\\"I do not know, your majesty. Accordng to your imperial command I, accompanied her highness to the chapel. I went as far as the stairway, that leads to the crypts. Her highness was strangely agitated. I tried, to soothe her, but as she looked below, and saw the open door, she, shuddered, and clinging to me, whispered: 'Countess, I scent the, loathesome corpse that even now stirs in its coffin at my approach.', Again I strove to comfort her, but all in vain. Scarcely able to support, herself, she bade me farewell, and commended herself to your majesty., Then, clinging to the damp walls, she tottered below, and disappeared.\\\"\\n\\nThe countess had just emerged from her dressing-room. Her dress for the, evening was of white satin, and the coronal of brilliants which flashed, among the braids of her black hair was worthy to be the bridal-diadem of, a queen. The Countess Baillou was tall and stately in her beauty, hers, was the fascination of the dark-eyed Italian, united to the majesty of a, daughter of ancient Rome, and the union was irresistible. Her throat was, slender, her head small, and her classic oval face was of a pale, pearly, hue, without a tinge of the rose, which, while it lends animation to a, woman's face, detracts from the camelia-like purity of genuine patrician, beauty.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, sir,\\\" said she, \\\"you have been true to your word. I was so afraid, you would forget me, that I was several times on the point of leaving, this grand place. I feel lonely and ashamed; for you see that no one is, here but myself. Nobody trusts the emperor. And I, who am here, will, surely be repulsed; he never will be as kind as you have been to a poor, friendless girl. My mother has no hope; and if she has sent me to the, palace, it was that I might see you again, and once more pour forth my, gratitude for your kindness. If you would add another to the generous, gift you have already bestowed, tell me your name, that my mother and I, may beg God's blessing upon it, and then let me go, for I feel that my, visit here will be vain!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" interrupted Maria Theresa, impetuously, \\\"yes, it is true. The, arrogance of these royal traders has provoked me beyond all bearing. I, will no longer permit them to insinuate of my own imperial rights that I, hold them as favors from the hand of any earthly power. It chafes the, pride of an empress-queen to be CALLED a friend and TREATED as a vassal;, and I intend that these proud allies shall feel that I resent their, affronts!\\\"\\n\\nyou would find that he is generous and ready to do justice to all men., Go home and write your petition; and come to-day at noon to the imperial, palace. The guards will allow you to pass, and a servant will be there, to conduct you to me. I, myself, will present your petition, and I know, that the emperor will not refuse a pension to the widow and child of a, brave Austrian officer.\\\"\\n\\nAt this moment Joseph heard the sounds of weeping. Turning, he beheld, coming toward him a young girl of about sixteen, whose slight figure, in, spite of the cool autumn day, was scarcely covered by a thin, patched, dress of dark stuff. An old, faded silk handkerchief was thrown over her, shoulders; her sweet, pale face was bedewed with tears, and her lips, were murmuring gentle complaints, though no one stopped to listen. On, her right arm she carried a bundle, which every now and then she, watched, as if afraid that some one might rob her of its treasures.\\n\\n\\\"Stop a moment,\\\" cried Maria Theresa. \\\"As you have been the instigator, of this thing, upon your shoulders shall fall the work that must arise, from it. I exact of you, therefore, to superintend the inoculation of my, subjects, and your pay as chief medical inspector shall be five thousand, florins. I also give my palace at Hetzendorf as a model hospital for the, reception of the children of fifty families, who shall there be, inoculated and cared for at my expense. This is the monument I shall, erect to my beloved Josepha; and when the little ones who are rescued, from death thank God for their recovery, they will pray for my poor, child's departed soul. Does this please you, my son?\\\"\\n\\nIt was long past midnight; but the Hotel Esterhazy was one blaze of, light. It had been one of the countess's first orders to her steward, that, at dusk, every chandelier in her palace should be lighted. She, hated night and darkness, she said, and must have hundreds of wax-lights, burning from twilight until morning. This was one of the whims of the, fair Margaret, which, although it amused all Vienna, was any thing but, comic to her husband, for it cost him one thousand florins a month.\\n\\nThis gave her courage. But she must have rest after her fearful, pilgrimage through that dark, empty house. She sank upon her satin, lounge, and abandoned herself to the joy and security of the hour. She, had just come to the end of a perilous journey. Night and danger were, behind, the rosy morning of safety was about to dawn. She was so full of, joyous emotion, that scarcely knowing what she did, her lips began to, move in unconscious prayer!\\n\\nat another the darkest and most flashing brown. Her bold profile, betokened great pride; but every look of haughtiness was softened away, by the enchanting expression of a mouth in whose exquisite beauty no, trace of the so-called \\\"Austrian lip\\\" could be seen. Her figure, loftier, than is usual with women, was of faultless symmetry, while her graceful, bust would have seemed to the eyes of Praxiteles the waking to life of, his own dreams of Juno.\\n\\n\\\"And the grand duke has accomplices, Catharine. Not one, nor two--but, half of your subjects mutter within themselves that the crown you wear, has been Paul's since his majority. Russia is one grand conspiracy, against you, and your enemies have pitched their tents at the foot of, your throne. They may well hate the only man who stands between you and, destruction. Their arrows have glanced harmlessly from the adamantine, shield of his loyalty, and there remained but the alternative of, calumniating him to his empress. Oh, Catharine, my angel; beware of, Paul, who has never forgotten how his father lost his life! Beware of, Orloff, who has never forgiven you for loving me! Both these traitors\\n\\n\\\"I am aware,\\\" replied the emperor graciously, \\\"that I was not expected;, but as this is the last day of our son's residence under the parental, roof, I am sure that my wife will see nothing strange in my visit. I was, with the archduke when your majesty's message reached him, and knowing, that you could have no secrets with the son which the father might not, hear, I followed the impulse of my affection, and came with him.\\\"\\n\\nwhat would become of Austria if I were not by, to keep him within, bounds? It will task all my genius to steer between the Scylla of a, bigoted, peace-loving empress, and the Charybdis of this reckless, emperor; to reconcile their antagonisms, and overrule their prejudices., Maria Theresa is for peace and a treaty with the Porte, who has lately, been a good-natured, harmless neighbor--Joseph thirsts for war that he, may enlarge his dominions and parade himself before the world as a, military genius. If his mother were to die to-morrow, he would plunge, headlong into a war with Russia or Turkey, whichever one he might happen, to fancy. I am obliged to hold this prospect forever before his eyes to, keep him quiet. I must also pay my tribute to the whims of the reigning, empress; and if we declare war to pacify Joseph, we must also make it, appear to Maria Theresa that war is inevitable.\\\"\\n\\nGunther bowed, and prepared to obey. The others went on with their work., Had Joseph not been so blinded by indignation against his private, secretary, he might have seen how one of the others raised his head and, glanced furtively around; how his face was pale, and his lips were, twitching; and how his hand was so tremulous that he was scarcely able, to hold his pen. No one observed it. The other secretaries were writing;, the emperor, in his wrath, saw nothing but Gunther.\\n\\nNot a smile was seen upon those appalled faces; men whispered to one, another that the count was the only son of one of the proudest families, in Hungary; and that the countess, his mother, had died of her son's, shame. The eyes of the women filled with tears, and, for the sake of the, martyred mother, they forgave the guilty son. The weeping of the women, deepened the sympathies of the men; and they began to murmur against the, heartless emperor, who degraded an illustrious subject, and sent a noble, countess broken-hearted to the grave!\\n\\n\\\"What! To exasperate the crowd! To endanger yourself, and drive these, poor, half-frantic creatures to desperation! Oh, by the love you bear us, all, I beseech you, have mercy upon those whose only possession on earth, is oftentimes the grave! You would deprive their children of the only, comfort left them--that of praying over the ashes of the departed. You, would deprive those who are condemned to live like brutes, of the, comfort of dying like men. You would have their bodies sewed in sacks, and thrown into ditches where they are not even allowed to moulder, but, must be destroyed by lime. No tombstone permitted over their remains\\n\\n\\\"No, sire, we do not threaten; we are in the presence of a truth-loving, monarch, and we are compelled to speak the unvarnished truth. We have, already borne much from your majesty's ancestors. But, until the death, of Maria Theresa, our fundamental laws remained inviolate. True, in the, last years of her life she refused to allow the states-diet to assemble;, but she never laid her hand upon our constitution. She was crowned Queen, of Hungary, and took the coronation oath. Charles the Sixth and Joseph, the First did likewise. Each one guaranteed us the right of inheritance\\n\\nFrom these painful and humiliating retrospections, the emperor's, thoughts wandered to the beautiful being, who, like a hamadryad, had, blended her life with the tree of Polish liberty. He thought of that, face whose pallid splendor reminded him of the glories of waning day;, and he listened through the long, dim aisles of memory, to the sound of, that enchanting voice, whose melody had won his heart long ago on that, first, happy evening at Neustadt.\\n\\nand forced submission to the requirements of court etiquette, soared, high into regions of exultant happiness. His countenance, once so cold, and impassible, was now full of joyous changes; his eyes, once so dull, and weary, glowed with the fire of awakened enthusiasm, and they looked, so brilliant a blue, that it seemed as if some little ray from heaven, had found its way into their clear, bright depths. The poor boy was an, altered creature. He was frolicsome with his friends; and as for those, whom he considered his enemies, he cared nothing for their likes or, dislikes. He had nothing to lose or gain from them; he was to leave the, court, leave Vienna, leave every troublesome remembrance behind, and go\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur,\\\" said the duke to Andouille, the king's physician, \\\"I leave, you that you may be able to open and embalm the body.\\\" Andouille grew, pale, for he knew perfectly well that the performance of such a ceremony, as that, was his death-warrant. However, after a pause, he replied, \\\"I, am ready, your grace, but you must remain to hold the king's head.

The princess herself was both a painter, and musician, and no one, more than she, loved Italy and Italian art.\\n\\nJoseph raised his head from the coffin, and stared wildly around. He saw, the priests, the acolytes with their smoking censers, the weeping, attendants of his wife; he saw the black hangings, the groups of, mourners, and his father and mother standing pale and sad beside him; he, heard the tolling of the bells and the dull sound of the funeral drum;, and now, now indeed he felt the awful reality of his bereavement, and, knew that as yet he had suffered nothing. Tears filled his eyes, and he, sank upon his father's breast. Sobs and wailings filled the funeral, hall, while without the inexorable knell went on, the drums still beat\\n\\nWith a look of unspeakable affection Joseph gave his hand to Lacy., \\\"Lacy,\\\" said he, \\\"if I have made this great sacrifice to-day, it is, neither from conviction nor fear; it is to show you what influence your, words have over me, and to thank you for the manliness with which you, have ventured to blame my acts. Few princes possess the jewel of a, faithful friend. I thank God that this jewel is mine!\\\" [Footnote: The, burial edict was as follows: \\\"As the burial of the dead has for its, object the speedy dissolution of the body, and as nothing hinders that, dissolution more than the casing of the corpse in a coffin, it is, ordained that all dead bodies shall be stripped of their clothing, and, sewed up in a linen sack, laid in an open coffin, and brought to the, place of interment. A hole shall be dug six feet long and four feet, wide, and the corpse being taken out of the coffin, shall be put into, this grave, strewed plentifully with quick-lime, and covered with earth., If more than one corpse is to be buried, the bodies can all be put in, the same grave.\\\"--Gross-Hoffinger, \\\"History of the Life and Reign of, Joseph II.,\\\" vol. ii., p. 146.]\\n\\nExhausted from fasting and such long vigils, her head reeled, and she, staggered to her couch. A cold shudder crept over her limbs; all was, dark as night about her; she tried to clasp her hands in prayer and, could not, for they were numb and powerless. \\\"This is welcome death!\\\", thought she, and her lips parted with a happy smile. Her head fell, backward on the pillow, and her senses fled.\\n\\nwhich, since the days of Philip II., have ever been the nest of, rebellion and revolt. To this alliance, therefore, we owe it that your, majesty still reigns over those seditious provinces. To Savoy we are, indebted for Lombardy; while France, perfidious France, has not only, robbed us of our territory, but to this day asserts her right to its, possession! No, your majesty--so long as France retains that which, belongs to Austria, Austria will neither forgive her enmity nor forget, it. See, on the contrary, how the maritime powers have befriended us! It, was THEIR gold which enabled us first to withstand France, and afterward, Prussia--THEIR gold that filled your majesty's coffers--THEIR gold that, sustained and confirmed the prosperity of your majesty's dominions. This, is the alliance that I advocate, and with all my heart I vote for its, renewal. It is but just that the princes and rulers of the earth should, give example to the world of good faith in their dealings; for the, integrity of the sovereign is a pledge to all nations of the integrity, of his people.\\\"\\n\\nSince his arrival in the capital, Joseph had been the theme of every, conversation. Every one had something to relate of his affability, his, condescension, or his goodness. His bon mots, too, were in every mouth;, and the Parisians, who at every epoch have been so addicted to wit, were, so much the more enraptured with the impromptu good things which fell, from Joseph's lips, that the Bourbons were entirely deficient in, sprightliness.\\n\\nWhen the nuncio had read thus far, he paused and raised his eyes to the, face of the empress. It was very pale and agitated, while the, countenance of the emperor, on the contrary, was flushed with triumph., Joseph tried to meet the glance of Prince Kaunitz's eye, but it was, blank as ever; sometimes fixed vacantly upon the nuncio, and then, turning with cold indifference toward the speaking countenances of the, devoted friend and inveterate enemy of the Order of Jesus.\\n\\n\\\"Free not only from others, but from me also,\\\" said the emperor, deeply, affected. \\\"I feel I have erred toward this innocent young girl. I have, deeply sinned; for, regardless of her peace of mind, I have allowed, myself to dream of a love that could bring naught and misery to both., For I will not conceal from you, my friend, how much it costs me to, renounce this sweet creature, and to promise that I will see her no, more. My intercourse with her was the last dying sigh of a love which, has gone from my heart forevermore. But--it must be sacrificed. Rescue, her, and try to make her happy, Kaunitz; try to efface from her heart, the memory of my blasting love.\\\"\\n\\nlo! he ran and hid himself under my mother's petticoats; and the two old, crowns fell foul of one another, and their palsied old wearers plotted, together, until the great war upon which I had staked my fame was, juggled into a shower of carnival confetti! Oh, you laugh at me, and, well may you laugh! I am a fool to waste so much enthusiasm upon such a, fool's holiday!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has your majesty any complaint to make of me as minister, or as, president of council?\\\" asked Kaunitz, almost roughly. \\\"Have I not, fulfilled the vows I made to your majesty ten years ago? Have I, discharged my duties carelessly? The ship of state which, in her hour of, peril, was confided to my hands, have I not steered her safely through, rocks and reefs? Or, have I been unfaithful to my trust? If your majesty, can convict me of crime, or even of negligence, then sit in judgment, upon the culprit. Tell me of what state offence am I accused?\\\"\\n\\nJoseph bent eagerly forward. He knew those strains so well! He, remembered the night when Isabella's tears had fallen among the, rose-leaves, and he had kissed them away. He saw her once more in the, pride of her beauty, looking at him from the depths of those glorious, dark eyes which he had so madly loved. The music gave life and being to, these memories, and its glamour brought back the dead from her grave! He, remembered how he had asked her if she loved him, and how, avoiding the, words so difficult to speak, she had answered with the witching tones of, her violin. Oh, that heavenly evening hour upon the balcony! She had, said, \\\"Love has its own language: come and listen.\\\" And Christina said, SHE HAD NOT LOVED! He could not, would not believe her!\\n\\nKaunitz looked at the emperor and slightly raised his finger by way of, warning. \\\"The King of Prussia,\\\" said he, \\\"is no longer the hero that he, was in years gone by; he dare not risk his fame by giving battle to the, emperor. He rests upon his laurels, plays on the flute, writes bad, verses, and listens to the adulation of his fawning philosophical, friends. Then why should he molest us in Bavaria. We have documents to, prove that the heritage is ours, and if we recognize his right to, Bayreuth and Anspach, he will admit ours to whatever we choose to, claim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh my father and my sovereign,\\\" said he in a voice that trembled with, emotion, \\\"my whole life will not be long enough to thank you for what, yon are doing for me in this critical hour. Till now I have loved you, indeed as my father, but henceforth I must look upon you as my, benefactor also, as my dearest and best friend. My heart and my soul are, yours, dear father; may I be worthy of your love and of the sacrifice, you are making for me to-day!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It appears to me that my son has no reason to lament the softness of, his own heart,\\\" replied Maria Theresa, bitterly. \\\"If he were absolute, sovereign here, the Jesuits would be exiled to-morrow; and the King of, Prussia, for whom he entertains such unbounded admiration, would be the, first one to offer them shelter. I will answer your vituperation, my, son, by reading to you a letter written by Frederick to his agent in, Rome. It relates to the rumor now afloat that the pope is about to, disperse the holy brotherhood. I have just received a copy of it from, Italy, and it rejoices me to be able to lay it before you. Hear your, demi-god.\\\"\\n\\nThe enraptured audience again forgot her eyes, and, entranced by the, music, hung breathless upon her notes, while she executed the, magnificent funeral march in \\\"OEdipus.\\\" Suddenly, at the conclusion of a, passage of exquisite beauty, she ceased, and her hands wandered feebly, over the keys, Her father, who was turning the leaves, looked almost, scornfully at the poor girl; who, alarmed and bewildered by his, unaccountable conduct, grew deadly pale, and finally, with a deep sigh\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" said she, with a disappointed look, \\\"this is no private letter. It, is nothing but a letter of instructions, directing me how to win the, king's confidence, so as to influence his policy and secure a new ally, to Austria. The empress need not remind me that I must look to the, interests of the house of Hapsburg. The Queen of France will never, forget that she is the daughter of Maria Theresa, and she will do all in, her power to promote an alliance between France and Austria. Tell my, mother that I never will cease to be her subject, and that her interests, shall always be mine. And now for the other mission.\\\"\\n\\ncertainly, does too little. I hear everywhere of interdicts, but nowhere, of concessions. Old things destroyed, but nothing created to replace, them. What will be the result of this? Austria must soon be reduced to a, mass of ruins, and your son will go down to posterity with a fame like, that of Attila. Save Austria! save him from the curse that threatens, both. We have not yet completed the noble edifice of which eleven years, ago we laid the foundations. We must finish the structure, and so solid, must be its walls that our thoughtless young reformer shall not have, strength to batter them down. Your majesty must remain the reigning, Empress of Austria. You cannot resign your empire to your son. Duty and, the welfare of your subjects forbid it.\\\"\\n\\ndropped a long white mantle over the shoulders of the ministerial, coxcomb. Is light folds closed around him, and, with an Olympian nod, he, turned toward the door, while the valet flew to open it. As soon as the, count appeared, the other valets, who, with the hair-dresser, stood on, either side of the room, raised each one a long brush dipped in, hair-powder, and waved it to and fro. Clouds of white dust filled the, room; while through the mist, with grave and deliberate gait, walked, Kaunitz, every now and then halting, when the brushes all stopped; then, giving the word of command, they all fell vigorously to work again. Four, times he went through the farce, and then, grave as a ghost, walked back, to his dressing-room, followed by the hair-dresser.\\n\\nOther humiliations besides this had been endured by the head of the, church. Perhaps in the two solemn benedictions which he had given--the, first in the palace-court, the second in the cathedral, Pius had hoped, to appear in public with the emperor as his spiritual vassal; but Joseph, was careful not to allow him this gratification. He had no sooner, learned that the throne of the pope in the cathedral was being erected, higher than his own, than he ordered the imperial throne to be removed\\n\\n\\\"and we, who require so much for our comfort, are poorer than they. But, as there is no help for our poverty, let us think of dinner. Here are, three streets; the village seems to have been divided for our especial, accommodation. Each one shall take a street, and in one hour from now we, meet at the carriage, each man with a dish of contribution. En avant! I, take the street before me; you do the same. Look at your watches, and be, punctual.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and you have silenced them with your cold arguments. The empress has, heard, and she it is who must decide against herself. She has no right, to sacrifice her empire to her maternity. May God forgive me,\\\" continued, she, solemnly clasping her hands, \\\"if I err in quelling the voice of my, love which cries so loudly against this union. Let it be accomplished!, Marie Antoinette shall be the bride of Louis XVI.\\\"\\n\\nShe crossed the room and stood before a Psyche, where for some time she, scrutinized her own features; not with the self-complacency of a vain, woman, but with the critical acuteness of an artist who contemplates a, fine picture. Gradually her eyes grew soft and her mouth rippled with a, smile. Like a mourning Juno she stood in the long black velvet dress, that sharply defined the outlines of her faultless bust and fell in, graceful folds around her stately figure. Her bodice was clasped by an, agrafe of richest pearls; and the white throat and the jewel lay, together, pearl beside pearl, each rivalling the snowy lustre of the, other. Had it not been for those starry eyes that looked out so full of, mournful splendor, her face might have seemed too statuesque in its, beauty; but from their dark depths all the enthusiasm of a nature that, had concentrated its every emotion into one master-passion, lit up her, face with flashes that came and went like summer lightning.\\n\\n\\\"I see it, I see it,\\\" cried Joseph, passionately, \\\"but I cannot take, it--I cannot play my part in this mockery of a return. No, mother, no, I, cannot kiss the hand that has so cruelly dashed my hopes to earth. And, you wish to carry your tyranny so far as to exact that I receive it with, a smile? Oh, mother, my heart is breaking! Have pity on me, and take, back those cruel words; let me go, let me go. Do not make me a byword, for the world, that hereafter will refuse me its respect. Let me go, if, but for a few weeks, and on the day that you command my return, I will, come home. Oh, my heart was too small to hold the love I bore you for, your consent to my departure. It seemed to me that I had lust begun to, live; the world was full of beauty, and I forgot all the trials of my, childhood. For one week I have been young, dear mother; hurl me not back, again into that dark dungeon of solitude where so much of my short life, has been spent. Do not condemn me to live as I have hitherto lived; give, me freedom, give me my manhood's rights!\\\"\\n\\ndesert the old style, to follow these new-fangled musical, eccentricities? Have we not all enjoyed the opera as it exists at, present? And if so, why shall this Master Gluck step suddenly forward, and announce to us that we know nothing of music, and that what we have, hitherto admired as such was nothing more than trumpery? Why does he, disdain the poetry of Metastasio, to adopt that of a man whom nobody, knows? I will not lend my hand to mortify the old man who for thirty, years has been our court-poet. I owe it to him, at least, not to appear, at this representation, and that is reason enough for me to refuse my, presence there.\\\"\\n\\nHe was inclining his head, when a wrest, of red roses and, orange-flowers, aimed by some skilful hand, fell directly upon his, saddle-bow. He smiled, and taking up the wreath, looked around to see, whence it came. Suddenly his eye brightened, and his countenance, expressed increased interest, while he reined in his horse that he might, look again at a lady who was leaning over a balcony just above him. Her, tall and elegant figure was clothed in a dress of black velvet, closed, from her white throat to her round waist by buttons of large and, magnificent diamonds, whose brilliancy was almost dazzling. Her youthful, and beautiful face was colorless, with that exquisite and delicate, pallor which has no affinity to ill-health, but resembles the spiritual, beauty of a marble statue. Her glossy black hair defined the exquisite, oval of that fair face, as a rich frame sets off a fine painting. On her, head she wore a diadem of brilliants, which confined a rich black-lace, veil, that fluttered like a dark cloud around her graceful figure. Her, countenance wore an expression of profound sadness, and her large\\n\\n\\\"I shall take the liberty of going in without awaiting an invitation,\\\", said the emperor, pushing open the door and entering the cottage. But he, started at the unexpected sight that met his view as he looked around, the room. It was a miserable place, cold and bare; not a chair or any, other article of household furniture was to be seen; but in the centre, of the room stood a small deal coffin, and in the coffin was the corpse, of a child. Stiff and cold, beautiful and tranquil, lay the babe, a, smile still lingering around its mouth, while its half-open eyes seemed, fixed upon the white roses that were clasped in its little dimpled, hands. The coffin lay in the midst of flowers, and within slept the dead, child, transfigured and glorified.\\n\\n\\\"I had last night a singular vision,\\\" she said. \\\"The spirit of my mother, appeared to me, and said that in three days I was to die. I believe in, this vision. Do not weep, dear sisters; I go to eternal rest. Life is, bitter, death is sweet. Pray for me, that my mother's prophetic words be, verified; and you, beloved friend of that mother,\\\" added she, kissing, the cameriera's cheek, \\\"you who know the depths of my heart, and its, secret, silent agony, pray for your child, and praying, ask of her, heavenly Father--death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My memory does not cling to dates, Theresa,\\\" replied the emperor., \\\"What, if to-day be accidentally the anniversary of our marriage? With, every beating of my heart, I celebrate the hour itself, when I won the, proud and beautiful heiress of Austria; and when I remember that she, deigned to love ME, the poor Archduke of Lorraine, my happiness, overwhelms me. Come, then, my beautiful, my beloved Theresa; come to my, heart, that I may thank you for all the blessings that I owe to your, love. See, dearest, we are alone; let us forget royalty for to-day, and, be happy together in all the fulness of mutual confidence and, affection.\\\"\\n\\nThe royal equipage had now reached the gates, and was passing into the, country. Marie Antoinette felt a sense of relief at the change. She, gazed with rapture upon the rich foliage of the trees, and then looking, pensively above for a few moments, she watched the floating clouds of, blue and silver, and then followed the flight of the birds that were, soaring in such freedom through the air.\\n\\na perfect fortune, lay at my feet; I moved my train to cover it, and, signed to Carlo, who, I must say, was always within call. He invited the, princess to dance, and--the pearls found their way to my pocket. What a, talk that loss made in Vienna! What offers of reward that poor woman, made to recover her necklace! All in vain, and nobody condoled more, affectionately with her than the charming, kind-hearted Countess, Baillou. This sorrow--but, pshaw! what a child I am, to be gloating over, my precious toys while time passes away, and I must be off to-night!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You did, indeed, give me a generous pension,\\\" replied Bundener, \\\"and, may God bless your majesty, for a more bountiful sovereign never bore, the weight of a crown. But desolation and despair sit in the places, where once your majesty's name was mingled each day with the prayers of, those whom you had succored. The emperor has withdrawn every pension, bestowed by you. He has received a statement of every annuity paid by, your majesty's orders, and has declared his intention of cleaning out, the Augean stables of this wasteful beneficence.\\\" [Footnote: Hubner\\n\\nwas decked to receive some great and distinguished guest. A rich carpet, covered the floor, flowers bloomed in costly vases, the piano was, opened, and the music on the stand showed that the countess still found, consolation in her genius. But she herself was strangely altered since, the day on which she had thrown her bouquet to the emperor in Neustadt., Nevertheless she wore the same dress of black velvet, the same jewels\\n\\nIrritable, crabbed, and low-spirited, his campaign had proved a, disastrous failure. Instead of planning battles, he had planned, pillaging and foraging expeditions, and his hungry and disaffected army, had converted the rich fields of Bohemia into a gloomy and desolate, waste. At last succoring winter came to the help of the oppressed, Bohemians, and both armies went into winter quarters. Maria Theresa had, employed the season, which forced her ambitious son to inactivity, in, new negotiations for peace. Count von Mercy had sought for intervention, on the part of France, and Baron Thugut had made new proposals to, Prussia. Until to-day the empress had indulged the hope of terminating, this unhappy and ridiculous war; but her hopes had been frustrated by, the dispatches she had just received from France and Bohemia. Count von, Mercy wrote that so far from accepting the role of mediator, the French, king expostulated with him upon the injustice of the claims of Austria\\n\\nIsabella said nothing. She had held up before her face the bouquet which, her husband had gathered for her, that her tears might fall unseen among, its flowers. Joseph saw those tears shining like dew-drops upon its, rose-leaves, and, taking it from her hands, he kissed them away. \\\"Do not, weep, my Isabella,\\\" whispered he tenderly; \\\"your tears fall like a, weight of sorrow upon my heart. Wipe them away, beloved. The day will, come when you also shall be an empress, and your people will do you, homage as I do now; and then you will have it in your power to heal, their sorrows, and wipe away their tears; and they will love and bless, you as I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it will not maintain you as you live with your handsome, pension. But you need not starve. Be that as it may, there is a blind, countess who is my patient, for whom Von Stork is to obtain the pension, as soon as you can convince the faculty that your daughter is no longer, in need of it. This patient, I assure you, will receive it as long as, she lives, for it will never enter into her head to fancy that she has, been cured by Master Mesmer.\\\"\\n\\nand no one has the courage to come between her and her mania for, match-making. I then appealed to her majesty myself; but in vain. Her, only answer was this: 'You were to marry the count, or go into a, convent.' She added, that to-morrow every thing would be prepared in the, court chapel for your marriage; that she, herself, would honor you by, giving you away; and that, if you did not come punctually, when the, imperial state coach was sent for you, she would have you taken instead, to a convent.\\\"\\n\\nThe prince gave a shrug, and trifled with the papers he had brought with, him. \\\"We have bound ourselves,\\\" said he, reading here and there among, the leaves, \\\"to bring about a peace between Russia and Turkey, by which, the former shall restore to the latter all the provinces which she has, conquered from the Porte; or, if not all, those which are indispensable, to preserve the honor of Turkey intact. We have furthermore bound, ourselves to secure the independence of the Republic of Poland.\\\"\\n\\nHer uncle heard her sob, and following the impulse of his affection and, compassion, he opened the room, and came softly in. He called her, and, she raised her head. The light from the wax-candles that stood on the, harpsichord fell directly upon her face, which was bedewed with tears., Her uncle's entrance seemed neither to have surprised nor irritated her., With an expression of indescribable woe she merely murmured\\n\\nMonsieur Etienne surveyed his notes of preparation, and gave an, approving nod. His face was radiant as he returned to the house; gave, another glance of satisfaction around the dining-room, and passed into, an adjoining apartment. This was the best-furnished room in the, post-house; and on a soft lounge, near the window, reclined a pale, young woman, beautifully dressed, whose vicinity to a cradle, where lay, a very young infant, betokened her recent recovery from confinement.\\n\\n\\\"I hope that I have never strayed from the path of right. The object of, my life has been to make Austria great and independent, and to aid my, emperor in freeing his subjects from foreign dominion. To-day no earthly, potentate has a voice in Austria, save Joseph; he is absolute master, here, and as all his acts have been for Austria's good, she has entered, at last upon a career of indisputable prosperity. But there is nothing, wonderful in this, when he had me as a coadjutor.\\\"\\n\\nOn that day the number of her enemies was increased by more than a, hundred persons, who attacked her with tongues sharper than two-edged, swords. The first thrust was given her on the morning that followed the, reception; and the same people who a few days before had been singing, her praises on the Pont-neuf, were equally, if not better pleased with, the ballad of \\\"La Reine moqueuse,\\\" of which the cruel refrain was as, follows:\\n\\n\\\"Shut the door, and admit no one during the visit of Prince Kaunitz,\\\", said the king. Then turning to the prince, he pointed to his flute. \\\"I, suspect you are amused to see such an old fellow as I coquetting with, the fine arts; but I assure you that my flute is one of my trustiest, friends. She has never deceived me, and keeps my secrets faithfully. My, alliance with her is for life. Ask her, and she will tell you that we, live on terms of truest friendship.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do. She besought me in trembling tones to tell her something of her, beloved child--and I did nothing to tranquillize her, --for she has no, right to seclude herself from her people. Maria Theresa is a greater, sovereign than her son will ever be, and Austria cannot afford to lose, her now. She will visit her daughter to-day. Tell the archduchess not to, fear her brother's opposition; for her mother, once resolved to return, to her people, will see that her own daughters are not made wretched by, a tyrannical brother. The princess will marry her lover.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" cried the emperor, \\\"the time for deliberation has gone by. The, hour for decision has struck, and I am free to give battle. It is, Frederick who has thrown down the glove, and I too, shall emerge from, obscurity, and prove to the world that others besides the King of, Prussia are worthy to lead their men to victory. It would be, dishonorable to refuse the challenge he has sent through his invasion of, Bohemia. Let orders be given to march to Jaromirs. We shall await the, enemy there; and there at last I shall measure swords with the greatest, captain of the age!\\\"\\n\\nInto a silence that seemed so breathless and so long, that her father, arose, frightened, from his knees. He bent over his smiling child, and, her face seemed transfigured. Not a sigh stirred he, bosom, not a moan, fluttered from her lips. But that smile remained so long unchanged, and, her eyes--surely they were glazed! Yes!--Rachel was dead.

It was a momentary, concession from the Queen of France to the memories of her childhood;, but I lay it at your majesty's feet, and entreat you to accept it as, your well-won trophy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, they have caged the eagle,\\\" said the empress, sadly. \\\"God in heaven, knows how manfully I have battled for Poland. When I threatened, interference, the answer was this: 'We have resolved to dismember, Poland, and you shall not prevent us.' What, then, could I do? Declare, war? That were to ruin my people. Remain passive, while my enemies, enlarged their frontiers, so as to endanger my own? We then had recourse, to stratagem. We defended our soil inch by inch, and gave up when, resistance became fanaticism. We required for our share more than we, desired, hoping to be refused. But no! To my sorrow and disappointment\\n\\n\\\"I know what they want,\\\" murmured she. \\\"Joseph thirsts for glory and, conquest, and Kautnitz upholds him. They want their share of the booty., And they will overrule my sympathy, and prove to me that I am bound to, inaction. Poland will be dismembered, and I shall bear my portion of the, crime. I shudder at the deed, and yet I cannot raise my hand without, shedding my people's blood. I must take counsel of Heaven!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To help your father in his projects of vengeance. You cannot conceive, how exultant I am when I see you surrounded by hosts of Christian, nobles, all doing homage to your beauty and your father's millions., Encourage them, Rachel, that they may become intoxicated with love, and, that on the day when they ask me for my daughter's hand, I may tell them, that my daughter is a Jewess, and can never be the wife of a Christian!\\\"\\n\\nIn the great reception-room of the imperial palace, a deputation of the, most illustrious magnates of Hungary awaited an interview with the, emperor. For one whole year the Hungarian nobles had withdrawn from, court; but now, in the interest of their fatherland, they stood once, more within the walls of the palace; and in their magnificent, state-uniforms, as the representatives of all Hungary, they were, assembled to demand redress for their national grievances.\\n\\n\\\"Treasures, indeed! They are part of the library of a convent. The, emperor has destroyed them as the Vandals once did the treasures of the, Goths. I bought them from one of our own people. And that is not all. I, have a communion-service and an ostensorium for you, whose sculptures, are worthy of Benvenuto Cellini. I purchased these also from a Jew, who, bought them at one of the great church auctions. Ha, ha! He was going to, melt them up--the vessels that Christian priests had blessed and held, sacred!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, countess, stay. The emperor says that you represent Poland. Then, let him justify his acts to us both, and prove that what he has done is, right.

Gunther,\\\" continued the, emperor, suddenly remembering the hussar, \\\"what has become of the man, whom I gave into your custody last evening?\\\"\\n\\nThe prince struggled to get free. \\\"You have disarranged my whole dress,\\\", said he, peevishly. \\\"On account of your folly I shall have to make my, toilet again. Hear me, and let me alone. I said that you would AFFECT to, be my mistress. To this end you will drive as usual to the side-door by, which you have been accustomed to enter the palace, and while your, carriage stands there for one hour, you shall be treated to a costly, breakfast in my little boudoir every morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" exclaimed she, \\\"the time went by four years ago. You can never, make amends to me, nor I to you. Look at yourself! You were then a young, man, with high hopes and a light heart. Many a woman would have been, proud to be called your wife--and yet you chose me. Now, that four years, of accursed wedded life have gone over your head, you have passed from, youth to old age, without ever having known an interval of manhood. And, I--O God! What have I become through your miserable cowardice! I might, have grown to be a gentle woman, had fate united me to him whom I love;, but the link that has bound me to you has unsexed me. Our marriage was a, crime, and we have paid its penalty; you are as weak as a woman, and, I--as inflexible as a man.\\\"\\n\\nsmiling. \\\"You will acknowledge that Russia is not always consistent; for, instance--in Poland, where she does not perceive the right of a noble, race of men to elect their own rulers, but forces upon them a king whom, they all despise. I must now declare to you that my sovereign will enter, into negotiations with Turkey on one condition only: that the, territorial rights of Poland be left untouched, not only by Russia, but, by any other European power!\\\" [Footnote: V. Dohm. \\\"Memoirs\\\" vol. i., p., 492.]\\n\\nbeautiful reality of our luxurious life is substantially before us. Away, with cowardice! He who treads the path which we have trodden, must cast, all fear behind him. Had we been scrupulous, or faint-hearted, you would, have been to-day a ruined nobleman, dependent upon the pittance doled, out to you from parental hands, or upon some little office pompously, bestowed by the emperor; and I--ha! ha!--I should have been a, psalm-chanting nun, with other drowsy nuns for my companions through, life, and a chance of dying in the odor of sanctity! We were too wise, for that; and now the structure of our fortunes is complete. Its gilded, dome reaches into the heaven of the most exclusive circles; princes\\n\\nwondering who it was that could add the weight of a sneer to the supreme, misery which was rending their hearts. It came from above; and every, face, even that of the wretched Podstadsky, as uplifted in horror. He, caught at the stake, and his vacant eyes rested upon the house whence, the cruel laugh had issued. There, on a balcony, guarded by several men, in black, stood a beautiful young woman. She it was who had dealt the, blow. In the hour of his agony her rosy lips had mocked him!\\n\\nHow changed, alas, was the high-born Carlo! How little this chattering, creature, disguised in serge, resembled the cavalier who had enlisted, the sympathy of the multitude! He was no longer a man, and name he had, none. His number, in scarlet list upon the left sleeve of his smock, was, the only mark that distinguished him from his brethren--the other, malefactors. But the fearful toilet was not yet at an end. The feet and, hands were yet to be manacled. As the handcuffs clicked around those, delicate wrists, the executioner looked up in amazement. Heretofore he, had been accustomed to hear the jeers and loud mockery of the multitude\\n\\nShe started, for she heard a sound near the side door. Now the key, turned in the lock, and in another moment the king walked in. He still, wore the magnificent Spanish court-dress in which he had received the, homage of his marriage guests. The order of the Golden Fleece was on his, breast, and also the sparkling diamond cross of the imperial house of, Hapsburg. Josepha, blushing, recalled to mind her night negligee, and, dared not raise her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I promise to free her, but I cannot promise to rescue her from the, memory of your majesty's love. Who knows that from the ring which she, has sworn to wear forever, she may not have inhaled a poison that will, shorten her young life? To rescue her from such a fate lies not in the, power of man. Time--the great comforter--may heal her wounds, but your, majesty must promise never to ask whither she has gone. For you she must, be dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In earnest!\\\" repeated Kaunitz, with a shrug. \\\"You statesman in, swaddling-clothes! You do not know the first principles of your, profession; and yet you have lived with me for thirty years! In, diplomacy there is no such thing as stability of policy. Policy shapes, itself according to circumstances, and changes as they change. The man, who attempted to follow fixed principles in international policy, would, soon find himself and his government on the verge of a precipice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, your majesty; in the name of every nobleman in Vienna, and, above, all, in the name of our noble ladies. I beseech of you grant us the, exclusive privilege of ONE garden, where we may meet, unmolested by the, rabble. Give us the use of the Prater, that we may have some spot in, Vienna where we can breathe the fresh air in the company of our equals, alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear child,\\\" said Joseph, laughing, \\\"if all the emperor's opponents, were as headstrong as you, the poor man would have but little hope of, ever gaining the good-will of his subjects. But I intend to prove to you, that you are unjust. Give me your petition. I myself will present it for, you. Wait awhile, until I send a messenger who will conduct you to the, emperor. Follow him and fear nothing, for I shall be there, too, and, there I will tell you my name. Au revoir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will--I promise to keep nothing from you.\\\" \\\"I promise the same to, you, and perhaps this plant of friendship may one day bear the flowers, of love. You are inexperienced in the ways of court-life. You will need, a pilot to steer you safe amid reefs and breakers. I will be this pilot, to you, I will teach you what to suspect and to avoid. Above all, never, venture to have an opinion that does not coincide with that of the, empress. We are all a pious and well-brought-up family who see with her, eyes, and hear with her ears, and never dare confess that we possess, sight or hearing in our own persons. Recollect that you, too, must fall, in the line of puppets, and give up your senses to the empress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! your majesty would remind me of that ridiculous affair with, Bavaria. It was my last Quixotism, the dying struggle of a patriotism, which would have made of Germany one powerful and prosperous nation! And, it was YOU who opposed me--YOU who, of all the potentates in Europe, are, the one who should have understood and sustained me! Believe me, when I, say, that had Catharine befriended me there, she would have won the, truest knight that ever broke a lance in defence of fair ladye. But, for, the sake of a dotard, who is forever trembling lest I rob him of some of, his withered bays, the bold Athene of the age forgot her godlike origin, and mission, and turned away from him whom she should have countenanced, and conciliated. Well! It was the error of a noble heart, unsuspicious, of fair words. And fair words enough had Frederick for the occasion. To, think of such a man as HE, flaunting the banner of Germany in my, face--he who, not many years ago, was under the ban of the empire as an, ambitious upstart! He thought to scare me with the rustling of his dead, laurel-leaves, and when he found that I laughed at such Chinese warfare\\n\\nHereupon he resumed his conversation with Noverre. The other guests, were indignant, for they all felt the insult. The nobles disapproved of, the fashion, which had been introduced by Kaunitz, of mingling artists, and savans of no birth with the aristocracy of Vienna; and the, ambassadors felt it as a personal injury that Kaunitz, who yesterday had, refused to wait for them, to-day called upon them to wait for a, musician.\\n\\nnot long since, saw fit to reprove the insolence of this same British, envoy, who in her very presence spoke of the Netherlands as though they, had been a boon to Austria from England's clemency. Incensed at the tone, of this representative of our friends, the empress exclaimed: 'Am I not, ruler in the Netherlands as well as in Vienna? Do I hold my right of, empire from England and Holland?'\\\" [Footnote: Coxe, \\\"History of the, House of Austria,\\\" vol. v., p. 51.]\\n\\nHush! Was there a muffled sound behind her? She paused and listened, her, eyes glaring as though they would start from their sockets. Pshaw! it, was only the rustling of her own silk mantle as it went trailing up the, marble staircase. Nothing in human shape was there, save two pale, statues, which stood like dead sentinels at the head of the stairs. As, she passed these she shuddered, and almost fancied that they had stepped, from their pedestals to follow her. Giving one quick glance behind, she, sped like a hunted doe through those halls, of which so lately she had, been the pride, and arrived breathless at the door of her boudoir. She, darted in, and there, safe in its place, was the picture.\\n\\n\\\"That I told him I would take rooms at the Hotel of the Ambassadors, but, I also reserve to myself this nice little bachelor establishment, to, which I may retreat when I feel inclined to do so. The advantage of, these double quarters is, that nobody will know exactly where to find, me, and I shall enjoy some freedom from parade. At the Hotel of the, Ambassadors I shall be continually bored with imperial honors. Here, on, the contrary, I am free as air, and can study Paris at my leisure.\\\"\\n\\nShe disappeared behind a little grove of trees, while her sister, contemplated their handsome patient. He lay perfectly quiet, his eyes, open, but feeling too weary for speech. He felt uncertain whether he, waked or dreamed, nor did he care; for the present moment was, unutterably sweet. His pain was slight, and with his head pillowed upon, the lap of the lovely girl whose face was beautiful as that of Eve in, the groves of Eden, the emperor gazed on in rapture.\\n\\nand jewels signified--marriage. Of that, there could be no doubt. But, who was to be the bride? The Archduchess Elizabeth was past thirty., Could it be that there was any truth in the rumor of a projected, marriage between herself and the old King of France? She was tired of, life at the court of Austria, and would have welcomed the change, had, the negotiations which were pending on that subject ever come to, anything. But they did not. [Footnote: They were frustrated by the, Countess du Barry, who never forgave the Duke de Choiseul for, entertaining the project. Du Barry prevailed upon the king to say that, he was too old to marry, and she revenged herself on Choiseul by, bringing about his disgrace. Alex. Dumas, \\\"History of Louis XV.\\\"]\\n\\nNeither of the two had gained any thing by this long war, except, glorious victories, honorable wounds, and a knowledge of the power and, bravery of its enemy. Both had serious burdens to bear, which, for many, years to come, would be painful reminders of the past. Austria, to cover, the expenses of the war, had invented paper money, and had flooded the, empire with millions of coupons. Prussia had coined base money, and all, the employes of the state had received notes, which were nicknamed, \\\"Beamtenscheine.\\\" After the war these notes were exchanged for this base, currency, which soon afterward was withdrawn from circulation as, worthless. But Prussia had obtained from Austria full recognition of her, rights to Silesia, and she in return had pledged herself to vote for, Joseph as candidate for the crown of Rome, and to support the, pretensions of the empress to the reversion of the duchy of Modena.\\n\\n\\\"You are a noble-hearted child, my Antoinette,\\\" said she. \\\"With such, sensibility as yours, you are likely to suffer from the faults and, misconceptions of the world; for magnanimity is so rare that it is often, misunderstood. You would share your sister's danger, while believing in, its reality. No, no, darling, I cannot accept your generous sacrifice., It would be useless, for Josepha's terror will shorten her prayers., Before you could reach the chapel, she will have left it--\\\"\\n\\nAt length he heaved one long, convulsive sigh. \\\"No--there is no other, remedy. I have toiled in vain--my beautiful structure has fallen, and my, grave is under its ruins! O my God, why may I not have a few months more, of life, wherewith to crush these aspiring rebels? But no!. I must die, now, and leave them to triumph over my defeat; for I dare not leave to, my successor the accursed inheritance of civil war. To the last hour of, my life I must humble my will before the decree of that cruel destiny, which has persecuted me from boyhood! Be it so!--I must clutch at the, remedy--the fearful remedy--I must revoke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come hither, my son,\\\" said the empress, reaching her hand to Joseph., \\\"Since I have seen fit to give my consent to this thing, I have nothing, wherewith to reproach you. As co-regent I hope that what I am about to, say will obtain your approbation. Monsignore, you have read to me the, order of his holiness, Clement XIV., for the suppression of the Jesuits., For my part, nothing would ever have induced me to expel them from my, dominions. But since his holiness sees fit to do so, I feel it to be my, duty, as a true daughter of the Church, to allow the order to be put, into execution. [Footnote: The empress's own words. Gross-Horitnger\\n\\n\\\"It means that I will make every effort to prevent a war between Russia, and Austria. If, in spite of all that I could do, there should be war, between you, it would not be possible for Prussia to remain neutral., Were she to do so, she would deserve the contempt both of friend and, foe. I would fulfil my obligations to Russia, that I might secure the, duration of our alliance. But I sincerely hope that it may be my good, fortune to mediate with such results as will spare me the espousal of, either party's quarrel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here in the centre, are the empire of Greece and the Archipelago. Take, notice of the colors on the map, for they show the boundaries. The, yellow is the boundary-line of the Greek empire. It begins in the, northwest by Ragusa, takes in Skopia, Sophia Phillippolis and Adrianople, as far as the Black Sea. It then descends and includes the Ionian, islands, the Archipelago, Mitylene, and Samos. That is the empire of, Constantine, whose capital is to be Constantinople. The red lines show, the future boundaries of Russia. They pass through Natolia, beginning in, the north by Pendavaschi, and end with the Gulf of Syria.\\\"\\n\\nThe streets were thronged with people that shouted for joy: the, balconies and windows were filled with elegant women, who smiled and, waved their hands in greeting to the royal pair. For all the world this, was a day of rejoicing, except for the two persons for whose sake the, rest rejoiced. These had no part in the universal gayety; and the mirth, which was inspired by their presence found no echo in their, souls--Joseph's heart was full of dislike and ill-will toward his, betrothed, and she was unhappy, fearing the reception that awaited her., She had trembled as she thought of the meeting with Joseph, and then of, the proud, powerful, and beautiful woman who was his mother. The fame of, her intellect, fascinations, and beauty had reached the court of Munich\\n\\n\\\"There are other ways of conquering besides the sword,\\\" said the crafty, Kaunitz. \\\"Coercion would but fortify the Magyars in their insolence., These haughty lords must be enticed from their fastnesses to Vienna., They must be greeted with honors, titles, and estates. They must be, taught to love splendor, to spend money, to accumulate debts, until they, become bankrupt, and their possessions in Hungary fall into the hands of, the crown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, Marianne,\\\" said he, putting his arm around her waist, \\\"hear the, secret history of my musical career. I will tell you of the misfortunes, which my genius has encountered through life. I begin with England. It, is of no use to go back to the privations of my boyhood, though they, were many; for hunger and thirst are the tribute that man must pay to, fate for the capital which genius gives to him, and which he must, increase with all his might and all his strength. Even as a boy I craved, less for bread than for fame; and I consecrated my life and soul to art., I thought that I was in the right way, for I had written eight operas\\n\\nBreathless and with compressed lips the king's friends listened to his, indistinct mutterings, and looked upon his swollen, livid, blackened, face. Each one had hurried by, and now they all were free again, and, were preparing to fly as far as possible from the infected spot. But the, clear, solemn voice of the archbishop--that voice which so often had, stricken terror to their worldly hearts--was heard again, and he bade, them stay.\\n\\nassured their majesties that the archduke was anxious to do right--not, because he was told so to do by others, but because he followed the, dictates of his own conscience. True, his highness would not see through, the eyes of any other person; but this, though it might be a defect in a, child, would be the reverse in a man--above all, in a sovereign. \\\"In, proof of the archduke's sincere desire to do right,\\\" continued Count, Bathiany, \\\"allow me to repeat to your majesties something which he said, to me yesterday. We were reading together Bellegarde on knowledge of, self and of human nature. The beautiful thoughts of the author so, touched the heart of his highness, that, stopping suddenly, he exclaimed, to me, 'We must read this again; for when I come to the throne I shall, need to know, not only myself, but other men also.'\\\"\\n\\nconstructed after \\\"his excellency's own design.\\\" Kaunitz was not aware, of it, but this wig of his, with its droll mixture of flowing locks, before, and prim purse behind, was an exact counterpart of the life and, character of its inventor. He had had no intention of being symbolic in, his contrivance; it had been solely designed to conceal the little, tell-tale lines that were just about to indent the smooth surface of his, white forehead. He bent his proud head, while the hair-dresser placed, the wonderful wig, and then fell to studying its effect. Here he drew a, curl forward, there he gently removed another; placing each one in its, position over his eyebrows, so that no treacherous side-light should, reveal any thing he chose to hide. Finally the work was done., \\\"Hippolyte,\\\" said he, to the hair-dresser, who stood breathlessly by\\n\\npainful by reason of the aching bones of three-score and ten. The young, princesses dared not raise their eyes to these representatives of, by-gone coquetry, for they were afraid to commit a crime--they were, afraid that they might laugh. But the ladies of honor, safe behind the, hoops of the queen and her sisters-in-law made merry over the, magnificent old ruins. Madame de Noailles was so busy with the front\\n\\n\\\"I have heard this fable before,\\\" said Rachel, with a glance of mourn., \\\"The priest who was sent to convert, has tried to console me for my, loss, by dinning in my ears that Gunther was a traitor; but I know, better. He is the victim of a Jew's revenge. It is you who have accused, him with false witnesses, false letters, with all that vengeance can, inspire, and wicked gold can buy. You are the accuser of my noble, Gunther!\\\" By this time she had arisen, and now she stood confronting her, father, her wasted finger pointing toward him, and her sunken eyes, glowing like lights from a dark, deep cave. \\\"Who says so? Who has dared, accuse me?\\\" said he.\\n\\nAll this, however, did not prevent the execution of the order for the, expulsion of the nuns. In spite of priests and people, the decree was, carried out on the 12th of January, of the year 1782. A multitude had, assembled before the convent of the Clarisserines whence the sisters, were about to be expelled, and where the sacred vessels and vestments, appertaining to the altars were to be exposed for sale at auction!\\n\\nThe trousseau of the archduchess was exposed in the apartments which had, once been occupied by the empress and her husband; and now Maria, Theresa, followed by a bevy of wondering young archduchesses, was, examining her daughter's princely wardrobe, that with her own eyes she, might be sure that nothing was wanting to render it worthy of a, queen-elect. The young girls burst into exclamations of rapture when, they approached the table where, in its snowy purity, lay the bridal, dress of white velvet, embroidered with pearls and diamonds.\\n\\n\\\"At the conclusion of the unhappy war which desolated both Austria and, Prussia, I had to consider what course for the future was likely to, recuperate the prostrate energies of Austria. I resolved in my mind, various schemes, and laid them before her imperial majesty. The one, which I advocated and which was adopted by the empress, had mainly for, its object the pacification of all European broils, and the restoration, of the various Austrian dependencies to order and prosperity. For some, time I waited to see whether your majesty would not seek to conciliate, France, and renew your old league of friendship with her king. But the, policy pursued by your majesty at the court of Russia convinced me that, you were thinking exclusively of securing your provinces in the east., This once understood, it became the interest of Austria to rivet the, links which bound her to France; for an alliance with her offered the, same advantages to us as that of Russia did to Prussia. Moreover, it was, Austria's opinion that Prussia was now too closely bound to Russia for, her ever to seek an alliance with France. It therefore appeared that our, good understanding with the latter would conduce to preserve the balance, of power among European nations, and that it would meet with the favor, of all those potentates who were anxious for peace. It follows thence, that the court of Vienna is perfectly content with her relations toward, France; and I expressly and distinctly declare to your majesty that we, never will seek to alienate Russia from Prussia, that we never will, encourage any advances from Russia, and that your majesty may rest, assured that we never will deviate from our present line of policy. This, was what I desired to explain, and I thank your majesty for the courtesy, with which You have listened to me.\\\" [Footnote: This discourse of Kannitz is, historical. It is found in Ferrand's \\\"Histoire des Trois Demembrements, de la Pologue,\\\" vol. i., p. 112.]\\n\\nMesmer played on, and now his music seemed an entreaty to some invisible, spirit to appear and reveal itself to mortal eyes. At least, so it, sounded to the ears of his listeners. They started--for responsive to, the call, a tall white figure, whose feet seemed scarcely to touch the, floor, glided in and stood for a moment irresolute. Mesmer raised his, hand and stretching it out toward her, she moved. Still he played on\\n\\n\\\"And this alliance,\\\" said Kaunitz, still pursuing the object for which, he was contending, \\\"this marriage is the result of one letter to, Farinelli. Your majesty once condescended to write to La Pompadour. THAT, letter won the friendship of France, and its fruits will be the marriage, of the Archduchess Marie Antoinette, and her elevation to the throne of, France. Your majesty sees then what important results have sprung from, two friendly letters which my honored sovereign has not disdained to, write. Surely when wise statesmanship prompts your majesty to indite a, third letter to the Empress of Russia, you will not refuse its counsels, and suggestions. The two first letters were worth to us two thrones; the, third may chance to be worth a new province.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Long live the emperor!\\\"' cried Joseph, contemptuously. \\\"They treat me, as savages do their wooden idols, When they are unpropitious they beat, them; when otherwise, they set them up and adore them again. Those over, whom I reign, however, shall see that I am no wooden idol, but a man and, a monarch, who draws his sword to avenge an affront from whomsoever, received. Blood alone will extinguish the fire; of this rebellion, and, it shall be quenched in the blood of the rebels.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me kneel, let me kneel!\\\" exclaimed she, while her beautiful eyes, suffused with tears. \\\"Here, at your feet, let me implore your protection, for Poland! Have mercy, sire, upon the Confederates, whose only crime is, their resistance to foreign oppression. Reach out your imperial band to, THEM, and bid them be free, for they must either be slaves, or die by, their own hands.

Gracious Heaven! what, if he should be proof against the, blandishments of woman! I fear me he is too cold--and Poland will be, lost.

And I--when he is, by, I sometimes forget the great cause for which I live, and--no, no\\n\\n\\\"What have I suffered?\\\" exclaimed Joseph, whose teeth chattered as if he, were having a chill, and who was no longer in a state to suppress the, terrible eruption of his heart's agony. \\\"What have I suffered, ask you?, I will tell you, empress-mother, what I have suffered since first I, could love, or think, or endure. As a child I have felt that my mother, loved another son more than she loved me. When my longing eyes sought, hers, they were riveted upon another face. When my brother and I have, sinned together, he has been forgiven, when I have been punished. Sorrow, and jealousy were in my heart, and no one cared enough for me to ask why, I wept. I was left to suffer without one word of kindness--and you, wondered that I was taciturn, and mocked at my slighted longings for, love, and called them by hard names. And then you pointed to my caressed, and indulged brother, and bade me be gay like him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" repeated Kaunitz emphatically, \\\"he will find his master in me. I, have never failed to make other men subservient to my schemes, and the, King of Prussia shall grace my triumph with the rest. He is the vassal, of Austria, and I will be the one to force him back to his allegiance., It is scandalous that this petty king should have been suffered to play, an important part in European affairs. I will drive him from his, accidental grandeur, and he shall return to his duty. I will humble him, if I can; for this King of Prussia is the only man in Europe who has, denied me the honors and consideration due me as a politician and a, prince.\\\" [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Ferrand, vol. i., p. 104]\\n\\nAt this moment there was a knock at the door, and the Duchess of Orleans, entered the room. A triumphant smile lit up the face of Madame, Etiquette, for now the ceremony would be prolonged. It was no longer her, duty, it was that of the duchess, to wait upon the queen. But the proud, Countess de Noailles could not condescend to pass the garment to the, duchess. That was the duty of the aforesaid lady of the bedchamber. The, mistress of ceremonies motioned her to approach, and the duchess began, to draw off her gloves.\\n\\nMeanwhile the king and the emperor reached the apartment which opened, into the private dining-room of the royal family. The princes with their, wives were already there; but Marie Antoinette always came at the last, moment. She dreaded the sarcasm of the Count de Provence, and the sullen, or contemptuous glances of the king. She would have given much to return, to the old stiff, public ceremonial which she had banished, but that she, could not do. It would have been too great a concession to the court., Her only refuge was to stay away as long as decorum allowed, and after, the emperor's arrival she never entered the room until he had been, announced.\\n\\n\\\"We shall rob it of its sting before we rob it of its treasures. And, whence comes the sting of these troublesome gnats? It resides in the, riches of the church and the privileges of the nobles.

The lord of the soil shall come down to the level of his serf\\n\\n\\\"But skill has availed; and to Van Swieten, under Providence, I am, indebted for my life,\\\" cried the empress, warmly. \\\"I know, Kaunitz, that, you have but little faith in heavenly or earthly physicians; and I pray, God that you may never acquire it through the bitter experience of such, suffering as I have but lately endured! Often during my sleepless nights, I have longed for a sight of your grave face, and it grieved me to think, that perchance we might never meet again to talk of Austria, and plan, for Austria's welfare. \\\"\\n\\nThe soldier bowed low. \\\"I put down my musket, and when the hour came, round for me to be relieved, I asked leave of my captain to come here to, see an old acquaintance. And, indeed, your majesty, I was not telling a, lie, for you once slept under my father's roof, and paid him so well for, the night's lodging, that he was able to buy some land to settle me upon, it, and thereupon I married my sweetheart. So that I did come to see an, old acquaintance; and now, your majesty, I have a firm hand and a sharp, eye, and if you say so, Frederick shall bite the dust before this day, week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You HAVE wounded it, your majesty,\\\" replied the emperor, with emphasis., \\\"You have dogged my steps with spies; you have suffered my character to, be discussed by your attendants. You have gone so far as to compromise, me with my own servants; forcing them to disobey me by virtue of your, rights as sovereign exercised in opposition to mine as your husband. I, gave Gaspardi orders to deliver Riccardo's note to me alone. I forbade, him to tell any one whither he went. YOU took my note from him by force\\n\\n\\\"His heart!\\\" exclaimed the girl. \\\"The emperor is without a heart. Even, toward his mother he is said to be undutiful and obstinate. He hates his, wife, and she is as mild as an angel. He whose pleasure it is to see an, empress at his feet, do you suppose that he can sympathize with the, misfortunes of his subjects? No, no; he has already stopped all pensions, which the generous empress had given from her private purse.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph had refused to attend the funeral. From the hour his, consciousness had returned to him he had locked himself within his, apartments, and night and day he was heard pacing the floor with dull, and measured tread. Not even the empress, who had stood imploring at the, door, could obtain a word in answer to her entreaties. For two days and, nights lie remained within. On the third day the emperor knocked at the, door, and announced to his son that all was now ready for the funeral\\n\\nHere the empress turned from the mirror and crossing over to the spot, where the emperor's portrait hung, she continued her soliloquy. \\\"But, Franz, dear Franz, you at least are spared the sight of your Theresa's, transformation. I could not have borne this as I do, if you had been, here to witness it. Now! what matters it? My people will not remind me, of it, and my children have already promised to love me, and forgive my, deformity. Sleep, then, my beloved, until I rejoin you in heaven. There\\n\\nMademoiselle Bertin, with a solemnity befitting the importance of her, office, swore that henceforth the hands which had been honored by, carrying out the ideas of a queen, should never work for lesser mortals;, that her dresses should be made with closed doors, and that she would, rather be led to execution than betray to a living soul the mysteries of, her royal patroness's toilet. [Footnote: Mademoiselle Bertin, from that, day, became an important personage, and received many a rich present, from noble ladies anxious to imitate the queen in dress.]\\n\\n\\\"It would have been a pretty anecdote for the history of the Emperor, Joseph, had he been discovered in a street brawl with a carman,\\\" said he, to himself. \\\"A little more, and my imperial face would have been pounded, into jelly by that Hercules of a fellow! It is not such an easy matter, as I had supposed, to mix on equal terms with other men! But I shall, learn by bitter experience how to behave.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor did not answer--his heart was too full for speech. The, empress saw his agitation, and opening her arms to clasp him in her, embrace, she faltered out, \\\"Come, dear child, and together let us mourn, for our beloved dead.\\\" [Footnote: The institution founded on that day by, the empress went very soon into operation. Every spring the children of, fifty families among the nobles and gentry were received at the hospital, of Hetzendorf. The empress was accustomed to visit the institution, frequently; and at the end of each season, she gave its little inmates a, splendid ball, which was always attended by herself and her daughters., The festivities closed with concerts, lotteries, and a present to each, child.

A longing, that seemed to drown him in the flood of, its intensity, rushed over his soul. He would fly to her presence and, implore her to forgive the chant of victory that was rejoicing over her, country's grave! Oh, the crash of that stunning harmony, how it maddened, him, as kneeling, he listened to its last exultant notes!\\n\\nMaria Theresa, always munificent, had devoted one wing of the palace to, the exclusive use of her young daughter-in-law; and her apartments were, fitted up with the last degree of splendor. Elegant mirrors, buhl and, gilded furniture, costly turkey carpets and exquisite paintings adorned, this princely home; and as the princess was known to be skilled both as, a painter and musician, one room was fitted up for her as a studio, and, another as a music-hall.\\n\\nConformably to her wishes, many irksome court-customs had been laid, aside at Marly. The strict lines of demarcation between royalty and, nobility no longer hampered the daily intercourse of the sovereigns and, their subjects. The lords and ladies in waiting were at liberty to join, the queen's circle in the drawing-rooms, or to group themselves together, as inclination prompted. Some talked over the events of the day, some, discussed the new books which lay in heaps upon a table in one of the, saloons; others, again, played billiards with the king.\\n\\n\\\"For your majesty, as well as for me, it suffices that I am true to my, duties as your subject. As to my duty as a man, this is no place to, discuss a matter which lies between God and myself it would be, indecorous for me to raise the veil of my private life before the eyes, of your majesty. I came here to speak of Austria's welfare and yours\\n\\nOne of their own class, however, succeeded in drawing them from their, hiding-places. The loud voice of Horja rang throughout every valley, and, ascended to every mountain-summit. He called them to liberty and, equality. He asserted that nobility was to be destroyed in Hungary., There were to be no more castles, no more magnates of the land. The, emperor had promised as much in Vienna. He had sworn to free the, Hungarian peasantry, and to bring the proud noble down to an equality, with his serf.\\n\\n\\\"Not even if I beg it as a favor to myself?\\\" asked Joseph fervently., \\\"Not even if I tell you that I have no wish so near at heart as that of, knowing the King of Prussia? Think of this day, so brightened to me by, the sunshine of your tenderness! Let the mother plead for me with the, sovereign; for it is not to my empress, it is to my mother that I, confide my hopes and wishes. Oh, do not drown the harmony of this hour, in discord! Do not interpose a cloud between us now.\\\"\\n\\nTherese Paradies was to give a concert, the first at which she had, performed since the restoration of her sight. Of course, the hall was, thronged, for in spite of the incontrovertible fact itself, and of its, corroboration by the Paradies family, there were two parties in, Vienna--one who believed in the cure, and the other who did not. Those, who did not, doubted upon the respectable testimony of Professor Barth\\n\\n\\\"It was a crime,\\\" continued she in a voice of deepest emotion, \\\"but she, has paid dearly for her sin. Her husband repulsed her, but her heart was, still his; he despised her, and yet she adores him. Her malady has long, since disappeared; her heart alone is sick; that heart which will break, if her lord refuse to forgive her the offence that was born of her love, for him! But oh, sire, he has no pity. When she meets him with imploring, looks, he turns away; her letters he sends to her unopened. Oh, he is, severe in his wrath; it is like vengeance from Heaven! But still she, loves, and still she hopes that one day he will be generous, and forgive, her another crime--that of not being blessed with beauty. For months she, has longed to tell him that she repents of her faults, that her, punishment is just; but, oh! oh! she begs for mercy. She was forbidden, to follow him to Innspruck, but she could not stay behind. His parents, gave their consent, and she is here at your knees, my lord and king, to, plead for mercy. Oh! has there not been enough of cruelty? See me, humbled at your feet; reach me your beloved hand, and bid me sit by your, side! \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" interrupted the banker, laughing. \\\"Who should betray you?, Not I. And no one but us two are in the secret. Who, then, should tell, the emperor that you were hidden behind the door while he dictated his, dispatches, and that you are such a skilful imitator? I swear that, Gunther himself would have been staggered had he seen those letters!, They are capital, and I congratulate you. You are a genius.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Lacy, gravely, \\\"it is possible that the flames of a, revolution may burst forth to consume this unhappy land. Oh, sire, have, mercy upon the poor people, whose eyes cannot endure the light of, reform!

What has she done that you should thrust her from, your heart, and doom her to confront, alone, the sneers and hatred of, your cruel relatives? She is pure, and her heart is without a stain. I, tell you so--I, who in unspeakable anxiety have watched her through, hired spies. Had I found her guilty I would have been the first to, condemn her; but Antoinette is good, pure, virtuous, and she has but one, defect--want of thought. It was your duty to guide her, for you received, her from her mother's hands a child--a young, harmless, unsuspecting, child. What has she ever done that you should refuse her your love?\\\"\\n\\nit is too late, I cannot retract upon the very eve of battle. The army, knows that we are about to engage the enemy, and my men are wild with, enthusiasm. The presence of Frederick upon Austrian soil is an indignity, which I am pledged as a man to avenge. If I allow him to retreat from, his present disadvantageous position, my name is gone forever, and all, Europe will cry out upon my incapacity to command. Remember, Leopold\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sire, they are indignant. Yesterday the first burial, according to, your majesty's edict, took place, and since then the people are in a, state of revolt. To-day there are of course other bodies to be interred., There is not a vagrant in the streets that does not utter threats, against your majesty. From the burgher to the beggar, every man feels, that his sacred rights have been invaded. They feel that the prohibition, of coffins and burying-grounds does not reach the rich, who have their, hereditary tombs in churches and chapels, but the people, who have no, such privileges.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! who will be troubled with looking into my heart in imperial, Vienna?\\\" sobbed the disheartened Josepha. \\\"Externals are every thing in, court; and I, unhappy one, who scarcely dare not utter my heart's, yearnings to those who encourage me, what will become of me if I meet, with cold glances or scornful words?

Concede, that Victor Emanuel is the soul of honor; still,\\\" added Kaunitz with a, shake of the head, and an incredulous smile \\\"still--the Italian princes, are abominable geographers--and they are inordinately fond of, artichokes. [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Kotmayr, \\\"Austrian, Plutarch,\\\" vol. xi.] Now their fondness for this vegetable is as, dangerous to Austria as the too loving grasp of her northern allies, who, with their friendly hands not only close their ports against us, but lay, the weight of their favors so heavily upon our heads as to force us, down upon our knees before them. What have we from England and Holland, but their subsidies? And Austria can now afford to relinquish them--, Austria is rich, powerful, prosperous enough to be allowed to proffer, her friendship where it will be honorably returned. Austria, then, must, be freed from her oppressive alliance with the maritime powers. She has, youth and vitality enough to shake off this bondage, and strike for the, new path which shall lead her to greatness and glory. There is a moral, and intangible greatness, of whose existence these trading Englishmen, have no conception, but which the refined and elevated people of France, are fully competent to appreciate. France extends to us her hand, and, offers us alliance on terms of equality. Cooperating with France, we, shall defy the enmity of all Europe. With our two-edged sword we shall, turn the scales of future European strife, and make peace or war for, other nations. France, too, is our natural ally, for she is our, neighbor. And she is more than this, for she is our ally by the sacred, unity of one faith. The Holy Father at Rome, who blesses the arms of, Austria, will no longer look sorrowfully upon Austria's league with, heresy. When apostolic France and we are one, the blessings of the, Church will descend upon our alliance. Religion, therefore, as well as, honest statesmanship, call for the treaty with France.\\\"\\n\\nMarie Antoinette colored with vexation at this reproof in presence of, one of her own subjects. \\\"Brother,\\\" replied she hastily, \\\"I admire the, facility with which you generalize on the subject of other people's, derelictions. Unhappily, your homilies are sometimes misapplied. My, secretary, Monsieur d'Augeard, has my full confidence; and these papers, are merely the quarterly accounts of my household expenditures. They, have already been approved by the auditor, and you perceive that I risk, nothing by affixing my signature.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were right, dear sister, but I am not so agreeable that you should, wish to have me constantly at your side. I wish to become acquainted, with your beautiful Paris. It is so full of treasures of art and wonders, of industry, that a man has only to use his eyes, and he grows, accomplished. I am much in need of such advantages, sire, for you will, find me a barbarian for whose lapses you will have to be indulgent.\\\"\\n\\nby importing goods free of tax, and reselling them here. All Vienna, knows that there are more silk stockings sold at the hotel of the French, embassy than in all Paris and Lyons together. The world blames me for, having revoked the privilege enjoyed by foreign embassies to import, their clothing free of duty. It does not know that the abuse of this, privilege by yourself has forced me to the measure.\\\"\\n\\nlooked wildly around. Her husband's sigh had awakened her from a, blissful dream, and once more her weary heart sank desolate to the, earth. But with an expression of tenderest pity she turned toward him, and smiled. Then her music changed; it pealed out in rich harmony, fit, for mortal ears. She saw her complete mastery over the archduke's soul;, his eyes grew bright and joyful once more, and from his countenance, beamed the light of perfect contentment.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Gregory,\\\" exclaimed Catharine, again moved to tears, \\\"I shall never, forget these words! You have sacrificed much for me, and you shall have, princely reward; on my word you shall! Let the grand duke be careful to, utter no inconsiderate words, for the steppes of Siberia are as, accessible to the prince as to the peasant; and every traitor, were he, the heir of the crown itself, is amenable to justice before me! And, Panin, with his eternal pratings of honesty and frankness, let him, too\\n\\nShe bent over and kissed the emperor's mouth, and for a moment laid her, head upon his cold, still bosom. Then again she drew her hand softly, across his eyes, and tried to close them. A proud smile flitted over her, wan face, for the eyes of the corpse closed. The loving hand of the wife, had prevailed where every other effort had failed. True to her wishes in, death as in life, the dead emperor had shut his eyes to earth forever.\\n\\nBut he was interrupted by the sound of music--music so exquisite that, the heart of the learned professor himself responded to its pathos. It, swelled and swelled until it penetrated the room and filled all space, with its thrilling notes. All present felt its power, and every eye was, fixed upon the enchanter, who was swaying a multitude as though their, emotions had been his slaves, and his music the voice that bade them, live or die.\\n\\n\\\"An emperor, a widower of two wives,\\\" said he to himself, \\\"and he treats, us to an idyl of the genuine Gessner stamp! An imperial Damon who spends, his time twining wreaths of roses with his Philis! Well--he had better, be left to play the fool in peace; his pastoral will keep him from, meddling in state affairs. Men call me the coachman of European, politics; so be it, and let no one meddle with my coach-box. That noble, empress is of one mind with me, but this emperor would like to snatch, the reins, and go careering over the heavens for himself. So much the, better if he flirts and drinks milk with a dairymaid. But how long will, it last? Eberhard, of course, has gone to Porhammer, who being piously, disinclined to such little pastimes, will go straight to the empress;, and then Damon will be reproved, and I--I may fall under her displeasure, for having known and concealed her son's intrigue. What shall I do?, Shall I warn the emperor so that he can carry off his Semele, and go on, with his amours? Or shall I--bah! Let things shape themselves. What do I, care for them all?

I, repeal the conscription-act, as well as all my reforms with respect to, the church. When this is ready, bring it to me for signature; and, dispatch a courier with it to the imperial stadtholder. Having satisfied, the exactions of Hungary and Tyrol, it remains to restore order in the, Netherlands. But there, matters are more complicated, and I fear that no, concession on my part will avail at this late hour. I must trample my, personal pride in the dust, then, and humble myself before the pope!, Yes--before the pope! I will write, requesting him to act as mediator\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty; but it is one which it is imperative for us to, follow. Necessity alone decides a national course of action. A good, statesman cannot be a cosmopolitan. He looks out for himself, and leaves, others to do the same. If Poland succumbs, it will be because she has, not the strength to live. Therefore, if her hour be come, let her die., We dare not go to her relief, for, before the weal of other nations, we, must have peace and prosperity for Austria.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, my lady, I took your note to the palace, where the emperor, has given positive orders that every one who wishes it shall be admitted, to his presence. The guard before the door let me pass into the, antechamber. One of the lords in waiting told me that the emperor would, be there before a quarter of an hour. I had not waited so long when the, door opened and a handsome young man in a plain white uniform walked in., I should never have taken him for the emperor, except that the lord, stood up so straight when he saw him. Then I knelt down and gave the, letter. The emperor took it and said: 'Tell your lady that I am not, prepared to receive ladies in my palace; but since she wishes to see me\\n\\n\\\"It cannot be,\\\" cried the empress. \\\"There is no sympathy between Austria, and Prussia, and peace will never come to Europe until one succumbs to, the other. No dependence is to be placed upon alliances between, incongruous nations. In spite of our allies, the English, the Dutch, and, the Russians, the King of Prussia has robbed me of my province; and all, the help I have ever got from them was empty condolence. For this reason, I have sought for alliance with another power--a power which will, cordially unite with me in crushing that hateful infidel, to whom, nothing in life is sacred. This is the news that I promised you. Our, treaty with England and Holland is about to expire, and the new ally I, have found for Austria is France.\\\"\\n\\nHe was therefore ill-prepared for the news which reached him from, Hungary. He had freed the people from slavery and taxation, and had, exacted that the nobles should pay their share of the imperial taxes. He, had instituted a general conscription, and the most powerful Magyar in, Hungary was bound to serve, side by side, with the lowest peasant., Finally he had forbidden the use of any other language in Hungary save, the German.\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" said the emperor, as they galloped off together, \\\"you must, prepare yourself for a long ride. We had anticipated an early start, to-day, and we are punctual. To be sure, we are minus an army, and, neither our hearts nor our trumpets are sounding triumphant blasts of, victory. Ah, friend, what miserable puppets we are in the hands of, Almighty God! Yesterday I was gazing exultingly upon the heaven of the, future, so clear, so blue, so silver-bright--when lo! the rustling of a, woman's dress is heard, and the sky of my destiny grows black as night., Yesterday I fancied myself a man--to-day I am a schoolboy in disgrace, upon my knees. Oh, Lacy, those weary knees ache me so, that I could sob, for pain, were it not laughable for a commander-in-chief to put his, handkerchief to his eyes.\\n\\nShe thought how her poor, martyred heart had never been able to give up, all hope of love and happiness; how day by day she had striven, through, humility and obedience, to appease her husband's anger. But he had, always repulsed her. One day she had resolved that he SHOULD see her., She knew that the emperor was in the daily habit of sitting on the, balcony which divided her apartments from his. She watched his coming\\n\\nHer son dared not offer his hand, for evil eyes were upon him, and he, allowed her to depart without a word. Slowly she traversed the scene of, sinful splendor, her tall, dark figure reflected from mirror to mirror, as she went; and before the receding vision of that crushed and, despairing mother the lights above seemed to pale, and the gilding of, those rich saloons grew dim and spectral.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" interrupted Josepha, \\\"I have not been unhappy; for I--I have, loved. I die happy; for he whom I love no longer turns abhorrent from my, presence. I shall die by the light of your pardoning smile. Death, that, comes every moment nearer, death, to me, brings happiness. He comes with, his cold kiss, to take my parting breath--the only kiss my lips have, ever felt. He brings me love and consolation. He takes from my face the, hideous mask which it has worn through life; and my soul's beauty, in, another world, shall win me Joseph's love. Oh death, the comforter! I, feel thy kiss. Farewell, Joseph, farewell!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I beg of your majesty to allow me to quit your service,\\\" replied the, man moodily. \\\"I cannot forget the words of Maria Theresa. I will not, skulk away from the world while I have strength to work. I am tired of, the idle life I lead. It is summer, and there is no fire to kindle. As, for the poor unfortunates whom I used to visit, I can do them no good;, their benefactress is no more. I must do something, or life will be a, burden; and if your majesty will condescend to give me leave, I shall, seek another place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thank your majesty,\\\" said he, after a pause. \\\"Your conduct toward me, is noble and magnanimous, and I shall be grateful for it to my latest, breath. You have acted as became a sovereign who has no right to set at, defiance the laws he has made. Had I been his judge, I should myself, have condemned the criminal who was once my son, and to-day is the, murderer of his mother. Years ago I sat in judgment over this, transgressor and when I did so, I lost my only child. As for the man who, to-day has suffered the penalty of his crimes, I know him no longer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You deny it--do you? Let me tell you that your praise or your blame are, all one to me; and if I have granted you this interview, it was to show, you how little I am disturbed by your censorious language. I know, something of the intriguing at Versailles. I have even heard of the, private orgies of the 'Oeil de Boeuf,' where Louis entertains his, favorites. And I will tell you what took place at the last one. The, Countess du Barry was diverting the company with accounts of the, hypocrisy of the Empress of Austria; and to prove it, she drew from her, pocket-book a letter, saying: 'Hear what the Cardinal de Rohan says, about her.' Now, cardinal, do you still deny that you correspond with, her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have seen them all,\\\" replied the empress, sadly. \\\"I have read all the, documents by which you have sought to prove that Austria has claims upon, Lower Bavaria, because, in 1410, the Emperor Sigismund enfeoffed his, son-in-law, Albert of Austria, with this province. I have read further, that in 1614 the Emperor Matthias gave to the archducal house the, reversion of the Suabian estate of Mindelheim, which subsequently, in, 1706, when the Elector of Bavaria fell under the ban of the empire, was, actually claimed by the Emperor of Austria. I have also learned that the, Upper Palatinate, with all its counties, by the extinction of the, Wittelsbach dynasty, becomes an open feoff, to which the Emperor of, Austria thinks that he may assert his claims.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor uttered a cry of fury, and grew pale with rage. \\\"He, reinstated the Joyeuse Entree! He presumed to do it! Did I not tell you, that Christina was my enemy? She it is who has brought this humiliation, upon me! She has dared revoke what I had commanded!--Oh, how those, vulgar rebels must have laughed to see that with their pestiferous, breath they lead power to blow away my edicts like so many card-houses!\\\"\\n\\nThe empress quickly raised her head, and, with something like her, accustomed imperiousness, said: \\\"I forbid any one of you to speak of, what you have seen to-night. In the simplicity of my grief, I do what my, heart urges me to do; but let not my sorrow become the subject of the, world's idle gossip. When the husband dies his wife, be she empress or, beggar, is nothing but a sorrowing widow. Ah! I am indeed beggared of, all my wealth, for I have lost the dearest treasure I possessed on, earth. All my joys will die with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us be seated!\\\" said the emperor, \\\"and pray admire my omelet and my, strawberries. Now, Coronini, the strawberries are tempting, but before, you taste them, I must tell you that they are tainted with treason:, treason toward my own sacred person. Reflect well before you decide to, eat them. What I am going to relate is as terrible as it is true. While, my omelet was cooking, I strolled out into the road to see if there was, any thing else in Wichern besides poultry, pigs, and dirty children., Coming toward me I perceived a pretty little barefoot boy, with a basket, full of red, luscious strawberries. I asked where he was going. He said, to the neighboring village to sell his strawberries to the farmer's, wife, who had ordered them. I offered to buy them, but my gold could not, tempt the child--he refused peremptorily to sell them to me at any, price. I argued, pleaded, threatened; all to no purpose. At length\\n\\n\\\"I do wish nobody else would come here,\\\" thought he, in an ecstasy of, disinterestedness. \\\"Suppose that the enemies of his majesty should, introduce a murderer in my house, and the emperor should lose his life!, I should be eternally disgraced. I am really responsible to his, majesty's subjects for his safety. I am resolved, since he has commanded, me to let these rooms, to allow none but ladies to occupy them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Angel!\\\" said Arabella, with a mocking laugh. \\\"If so, call me your, fallen angel; for when I took the unfathomable leap which leads from, innocence to guilt, your arms were outstretched to receive me. But, pshaw! what bootless retrospection! I am here, Carl, true as steel;, ready to stand or fall at your side. Feel my hand, it is warm--feel my, pulse, it beats as evenly as though I had never slept a night out of, Eden.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His words to the Jew are as insolent as his deeds are wicked. But I, know very well how to exasperate and humble the Christians. I do it by, means of my rich dwelling and my costly equipages. I do it by inviting, them to come and see how far more sumptuously I live than they. The, sight of my luxuries blackens their hearts with envy; but most of all, they envy the Jewish banker that his daughter so far outshines in beauty, their Gentile women!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty must forgive me,\\\" reiterated the countess; \\\"I have sworn, on my mother's grave, that as long as I can be useful, I will live for, Poland. Should she regain her freedom, I will retire to a convent, where, every breath I draw shall be a thanksgiving to God. Should she be doomed, to slavery, she will need her sons and daughters no more, and then I, will die. Your majesty sees that I am already betrothed. I shall soon be, the bride of Heaven, or the bride of Death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must wait then until my mirrors are made,\\\" said the empress, after a, pause. \\\"You must think that I have less than woman's vanity, my son, if, you expect me to remain for weeks without a greeting from my, looking-glass. Of course the small-pox has not dared to disfigure the, face of an empress; I feel secure against its sacrilegious touch. Is it, not so, my little Marie Antoinette? Has it not respected your mother's, comeliness?\\\"\\n\\nEvery man had an anecdote to relate that concerned Joseph. Yesterday he, had visited the Hotel-Dieu. He had even asked for admission to the, apartments of the lying-in women, and upon being refused entrance by the, sisters, he had said, \\\"Do let me see the first scene of human misery.\\\", The sisters, struck by the words as well as by the noble bearing of the, stranger, had admitted him; and upon taking leave he had remarked to the, nun who accompanied him, \\\"The sufferings which you witness in this room\\n\\n\\\"No, I fear nothing--certainly not death,\\\" returned the emperor. \\\"It, must be sweet to die, and part from the disappointments of life; for man, either goes to eternal sleep, or wakes forever to eternal happiness! I, am not afraid of death, but I must put my house in order, for bullets, respect no man, and they have never yet been taught that an emperor is, not to be approached without ceremony. One might strike me on the head, and send me to my eternal rest. Why, what a doleful face you wear\\n\\nMarianne, smiling, reached out her hand to the astounded poet. \\\"Forgive, his stormy temper,\\\" said she, gently; \\\"he can no more bear contradiction, than a spoiled child. His wrath looks formidable; but though there is, much thunder, there is no lightning about him. Wait a quarter of an, hour, kind friend, and he will be back, suing for pardon and imploring, us to take his hand, just like a naughty child that he is. Then he will, smile, and look so ashamed that you will never have the heart to feel, resentful.\\\"\\n\\nA deadly paleness overspread the face of the young prince, and his whole, frame shivered. The emperor felt the shudder, and drew his son's arm, closer to his heart. \\\"Courage, my son, courage!\\\" whispered he: then, turning toward the imperial embassy, he said aloud, \\\"Announce to her, majesty that I will accompany the arch-duke in a few moments.\\\" And as, the marshal stood irresolute and confused, the emperor, smiling, said:, \\\"Oh, I see that you have been ordered to accompany the prince, yourselves. Come, then, my son, we will e'en go along with the, messengers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" replied the unconscious Luschinka; \\\"I have been twice married, and twice divorced; but it was not my fault. I loved my first husband, with a depth of passion which he could not appreciate, and I was in an, agony of despair when six months after our marriage he told me that he, loved me no longer, and was dying for the Countess Luwiendo. She was my, bosom friend, so you can imagine my grief; mais j'ai su faire bonne mine, a mauvais jeux. I invited the countess to my villa, and there, under the, shade of the old trees in the park, we walked arm in arm, and arranged, with my husband all the conditions of the separation. Every one praised, my generous conduct; the men in particular were in raptures, and Prince, Lubomirski, on the strength of it, fell so desperately in love with me\\n\\n\\\"For God's sake,\\\" cried Joseph, \\\"do not let the rushes hear you, lest, they betray me to the babbling wind, and the wind bear it to the King of, Prussia. But you have guessed. Bavaria is a portion of my Silesia, but, only a portion. Bavaria is mine by right of inheritance, and I shall, take it when the time comes. It will be a comely patch to stop some of, the rents in my imperial mantle. But my Silesia lies at every point of, the compass. To the east lie Bosnia and Servia--to the south, see, superannuated Venice. The lion of St. Mark is old and blind, and will, fall an easy prey to the eagle of Hapsburg, This will extend our, dominions to the Adriatic sea. When the Duke of Modena is gathered to, his fathers, my brother, in right of his wife, succeeds to the title;, and as Ferrara once belonged to the house of Modena, he and I together, can easily wrest it from the pope. Close by are the Tortonese and, Alessandria, two fair provinces which the King of Sardinia supposes to, be his. They once formed a portion of the duchy of Milan; and Milan is, ours, with every acre of land that ever belonged to it. By Heaven, I, will have all that is mine, if it cost me a seven years' war to win it, back! This is not all. Look toward the west, beyond the spires of, Strasburg, where the green and fertile plains of Alsatia woo our coming., They now belong to France, but they shall be the property of Austria., Farther on lies Lorraine. That, too, is mine, for my father's title was, 'Duke of Lorraine.' What is it to me that Francis the First sold his, birthright to France? All that I covet I shall annex to Austria, as, surely as Frederick wrested Silesia from me.\\\"\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, the chateau of Versailles was deserted. The, courtiers, pages, equerries, and lackeys, had all departed, delighted to, leave that infected atmosphere within whose poisonous influence the iron, rules of etiquette had detained them while Louis XV. lived. None of them, felt inclined to do homage to departed royalty. Even the Duke de, Villequier, first gentleman of the bed-chamber, in his terror, forgot, etiquette; and instead of watching the king's corpse, he, too, made, ready to go with the rest.\\n\\n\\\"He is right,\\\" said she, after a time. \\\"She wanders upon the edge of a, precipice, and I must save her. But, oh my God! where shall I find a, friend who will love her enough to brave her displeasure, and, in the, midst of the flattery which surrounds her, will raise the honest voice, of reproof and censure? Ah, she is so unhappy, my little Antoinette, and, I have no power to help her! Oh my God! succor my persecuted child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sweet priestess of love! how truly thou art the interpreter of our, passion! For it is OURS, my Isabella, is it not? It is our love of which, we speak, not mine alone. I have confessed to thee; now do the same by, me. Tell me, my wife, didst thou hate the man to whom thy passive hand, was given, without one thought of thee or of thy heart's predilections?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a bold advocate of my people's claims,\\\" said she; \\\"a brave, defender of my Austria. I rejoice to know it, and never will take, umbrage at what you have so nobly spoken. But you have not convinced me;, my sorrow speaks louder than your arguments. You have termed me 'your, emperor.' I know why you have once more called me by that flattering, title. You wish to remind me that in mounting the throne of my ancestors, I lost the right to grieve as a woman, and pledged myself to gird on the, armor of manhood. Hitherto I have made it my pride to plan, to reign, to, fight like a man. I have always feared that men might say of me that my, hand was too weak to grasp the reins of power. But God, who perhaps gave, me the head of a man while leaving me the heart of a woman, has punished, me for my ambition. He has left me to learn that, alas! I am but a, woman--with all the weakness of my sex. It is that womanly heart which\\n\\nFrederick. If he should discover it, he might suppose that I, like the, rest of the world, am abashed in the presence of a king because he has, some military fame. No--no--what excites me is the fact that I am about, to write a bit of history; for this interview between Prussia and, Austria will be historical. It is the fate of Europe--that fate which I, hold in my hands, that stirs me with such unwonted emotion. This King of, Prussia has nothing to do with it. No doubt he hopes to hoodwink me with, flattery, but I shall work him to my ends, and force him to that line of, policy which I have long ago laid down for Austria's welfare.\\\"\\n\\nEvery one felt bound to speak a word of love or of admiration, and it, was only by dint of great exertion that the two footmen who preceded the, queen were able to open a small space through which she could pass. She, felt annoyed--even alarmed--and for the first time in her life regretted, the etiquette which once had required that the Queen of France should, not traverse the galleries of Versailles without an escort of her ladies, of honor.\\n\\nPotemkin took the etui and without opening it laid it on the table, beside him. \\\"Ah,\\\" said he, with a shrug, \\\"his majesty sends me the Black, Eagle. I am much obliged to him, but really I have so many orders that I, have nowhere left to wear them, and how to dispose of this new one I, scarcely know. See for yourself,\\\" continued he smiling, and pointing to, his breast, which indeed was covered with crosses, \\\"do I not look like a, vender of orders, carrying about his samples?\\\" [Footnote: All Potemkin's, own words. Dohm's Memoirs. vol. i., p 4l3]\\n\\n\\\"And I will keep my promise faithfully,\\\" replied the empress, reaching, him her hand. \\\"Nevertheless, I cling to the hope that you have, exaggerated the defects of the princesses, and that they are not, altogether as ugly as you have pictured them to me.\\\" [Footnote: This, conversation is historical, and the criticism of Count Dietrichstein, upon the two princesses, as here related, is almost verbatim. See, Wraxall's \\\"Memoirs,\\\" vol. ii., page 406.]\\n\\nHe turned away that she might not see the tears which had gathered in, his eyes and were ready to fall. As for Therese, she rose to her feet., For one moment, her heart stood still--the next, her blood was coursing, so wildly through her veins that she thought he must surely hear its mad, throbbings in the stillness of that little room. The emperor turned, again, and his face was grave, but calm. He had mastered his emotion\\n\\n\\\"Go, then, and the blessings of your fallen angel go with you! Play your, game cautiously, and let us hear the chink of Herr Eskeles Flies' gold, near the rustling of our fragile bank-notes. And now go. Return in half, an hour, that I may receive you in presence of our fastidious guests., They might not approve of this tete-a-tete, for you are said to be a sad, profligate, Carl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear friend, how I thank you for sparing me the sight of these, hideous rites! Your arrangements must have been exquisite, for I never, so much as suspected the thing. Fortunately, it is all over, and we can, enjoy ourselves as usual. Here, Philip. Let the house look festive:, flowers on the staircases and in the entrance-hall; oranges and roses in, the dining-room; vanilla-sticks in the coffee-cups instead of teaspoons., Away with you!\\\"\\n\\nThe princess had not been wedded by proxy; it was therefore necessary, that she should be married with the blessings of the church, before she, proceedcd in state to the throne-room to receive the homage due to her, as a queen. No time had therefore been given her to retire before the, ceremony, and she was married in her travelling-dress. At the entrance, of the chapel stood the new ladies in waiting of the Queen of Rome. One, of them relieved her of her hat, which the empress replaced by a wreath, of myrtle. Then Maria Theresa, having placed the hand of Josepha in that, of her son, the imperial cortege approached the altar.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried he, bitterly, \\\"how it will rejoice them to see me so weak, and sick! They will go home and tell their Hungarians that there is no, strength left in me to fight with traitors! But they shall not know it., I will be the emperor, if my life pay the forfeit of the exertion. Lead, me to the door, Gunther. I will lean against one of the pillars, and, stand while I give audience to the Magyars.\\\"\\n\\ntoo, looks upon Poland as the apple of Eris, and she has found it so, over-ripe that it is in danger of falling from the tree. She has, stationed her gardener, Stanislaus, to guard it. Let him watch over it., It belongs to him, and if it come to the ground, he has nobody to blame, but himself. Meanwhile, should it burst, we will find means to prevent, it from soiling US. Now let us speak of Turkey. That unlucky Porte must, have something done for him, and while we mediate in his behalf, I hope, to bring about a good understanding between Austria and Russia. Let us, do our best to promote a general peace. Europe is bleeding at every, pore; let us bind up her wounds, and restore her to health.\\\"\\n\\nwho leaned against a pillar, fixed his eyes upon Therese with a glance, of supreme happiness. Therese returned the glance with one of such deep, trust and love, that no one who saw it could doubt her power of vision., The audience burst out into one simultaneous storm of applause, and this, reminded the young girl that she was not alone with her \\\"master.\\\" She, raised her eyes for the first time toward the spectators, and met every, glance directed toward herself.\\n\\n\\\"The fierce countess is about to be tamed,\\\" thought he. \\\"I shall win my, bet, and humble this insolent beauty. Let her rule if she must, until we, reach Paris; but there I will repay her, and her chains shall not be, light. Really, this is a piquant adventure. I am making a delightful, wedding-tour, without the bore of the marriage-ceremony, at the expense, of the most beautiful woman in Europe; and to heighten the piquancy of, the affair, I am to receive two thousand louis d'ors on my return to, Vienna. Here she comes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are resolved to speak of Poland,\\\" said Frederick, again taking so, large a pinch of snuff that it bedaubed not only his face, but his white, Austrian uniform. He brushed it off with his fingers, and shaking his, head, said: \\\"I am not neat enough to wear this elegant dress. I am not, worthy of wearing the Austrian livery.\\\" He then resumed: \\\"You interest, yourself in Poland. I thought that Polish independence had been thrown, to the winds. I thought, also, that your highness was of the same, opinion on this question as the Empress Catharine, who says that she, neither knows where Polish territory begins nor where it ends. Now I am, equally at a loss to know what is and what is not Poland, for in Warsaw, a Russian army seems to be perfectly at home, and in the south of Poland, an Austrian regiment affirms that they occupy Polish ground by command, of the Austrian government.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I beg you to believe, my verdant friend, that I never forget any, thing,\\\" said Kaunitz, somewhat haughtily. \\\"I am perfectly au fait to the, Russo-Prussian treaty; but I have not been invited to the banquet, and I, do not intend to go uninvited. When they speak, we will consider their, offers. If they say nothing, we go to war. If they speak, we will allow, ourselves to be persuaded to share the booty which we cannot restore to, its owners. In that way, we are in a manner forced into this coalition\\n\\nstudents, and civil officers of various grades. Almost every class found, some representatives in that brilliant assemblage; and each one felt, keenly the privilege he enjoyed in being present on that particular, occasion. But it was not altogether for the sake of the music that all, Paris had flocked to the opera. The Parisians were less desirous to hear, \\\"Iphigenia,\\\" than to see the emperor, who was to be there in company, with his sister.\\n\\nOn the other hand were Gluck and his friend Calzabigi, whose partisans, disdained the old style, and lauded the new one to the skies. Gluck was, perfectly indifferent to all this strife of party. Not once, since the, first day of rehearsal, had his countenance lost its expression of calm, and lofty security. Resolved to conquer, he receded before no obstacle., In vain had the prima donna, the renowned Gabrielle, complained of, hoarseness: Gluck blandly excused her, and volunteered to send for her, rival, Tibaldi, to take the role of Eurydice. This threat cured the, hoarseness, and Gabrielle attended the rehearsals punctually. In vain, had Guadagni attempted, by a few fioritures, to give an Italian turn to, the severe simplicity of Orpheus's air. At the least deviation from his, text, Gluck, with a frown, would recall the ambitious tenor, and do away, with his embellishments. In vain had the chorus-singers complained of, the impossibility of learning their parts. Gluck instructed them one by, one. He had trained the orchestra, too, to fullest precision; and, finally, every difficulty overcome, the great opera of \\\"Orpheus and, Eurydice\\\" was ready for representation on the birthday of the, Archduchess Isabella.\\n\\n\\\"Kusinski went on with his sword drawn over the king's head, although he, begged him for rest. But the king saw that Kosinski looked undecided and, uneasy, so as they came near to the Convent of Bielani, he said to, Kosinski, 'I see that you don't know which way to act, so you had, better let me go into the convent to hide, while you make your escape by, some other way.' But Kosinski said no, he had sworn to kill him. So they, went on farther, until they came to Mariemont, a castle belonging to the, Elector of Saxony. Here the king begged for rest, and they sat down and, began to talk. Then Kosinkski told the king he was not killing him of, his own will, but because he had been ordered to do so by others, to, punish the king for all his sins, poor fellow! against Poland. The king, then said it was not his fault, but all the fault of Russia, and at last, he softened the murderer's heart. Kosinski threw himself at the king's, feet and begged pardon, and promised to save him. So Stanislaus promised, to forgive him, and it was all arranged between them. They went on to a, mill near Mariemont, and begged the miller to let in two travellers who, had lost their way. At first the miller took them to be robbers, but, after a great deal of begging, he let them in. Then the king tore a leaf, out of his pocket-book, and wrote a note to General Cocceji. The, miller's daughter took it to Warsaw, not without much begging on the, king's part; and you can conceive the joy of the people when they heard, that the king was safe, for everybody seeing his cloak in the streets\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Maria Theresa, sternly, while her fiery eyes sought the, figure of her son, \\\"now we are alone, and Joseph is at liberty to speak., I beg him to remember, that in the person of his mother, he also sees, his sovereign, and that the empress will resent every word of disloyalty, spoken to the parent. And I hold it to be highly disloyal for my son to, accuse me of making sport of his hopes. I have not come to my latest, determination from cruelty or caprice; I have made it in the strength of, my maternal love to shield my child from sin, and in the rectitude of my, imperial responsibility to my people, who have a right to claim from me, that I bestow upon them a monarch who is worthy to reign over Austria., Therefore, my son, as empress and mother, I say that you shall remain., That is now my unalterable will. If this decision grieves you, be humble, and submissive; and remember that it is your duty, as son and subject\\n\\n\\\"But, Anna,\\\" cried the emperor, with a sudden burst of feeling, \\\"you, would rattler be obliged to the man whom you loved than to a stranger., Oh, if you but loved me, there would be no question of 'mine or thine', between us! It is said--I have betrayed myself, and I need stifle my, passion no longer; for I love you, beautiful Anna, I love you from my, soul, and, at your feet, I implore you to give me that which is above, all wealth or titles. Give me your love, be mine. Answer me, answer me., Do you love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will tell your highness. I had lost my young wife, the one I loved, best on earth, and I came to beg my discharge; for my longing was to go, back to my native mountains and live a hermit's life in Tyrol. My, empress would not release me. `How!' said she, 'are you so weak that you, must skulk away from the world because Almigthy God has seen fit to, bereave you of your wife? He tries your faith, man, and you must be, firm, whether you face the storm or bask in the sunshine. Did you not, promise to serve me faithfully, and will you now cast away your useful, life in vain sorrow? What would you think of me were I so lightly to, break my oath to my people--I who must lift my head above every tempest, of private sorrow, to fulfill my vow until death,' Thus spoke my, empress; but that was many years ago, and she was then sovereign of all, Austria.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go, Matuschka,\\\" said she, \\\"and take some rest. You have been laboring, for me all day, and I cannot bear to think that the only friend left me, in this world should be overtasked for me. Sometimes you look at me as, my mother once did; and then I dream that I feel her hand laid lovingly, upon my head, and hear her dear voice exhorting me to pray that God, would bless me with strength to do my duty to my bleeding country.\\\", Matuschka fell upon her knees and kissed the hem of her mistress's robe.\\n\\nwas hurrying from buffet to table, from table to kitchen, superintending, the servants. The cook was deep in the preparation of her roasts and, warm dishes; and at the kitchen door sat a little maiden, who, with, important mien, was selecting the whitest and crispest leaves from a, mountain of lettuce which she laid into a large gilt salad-bowl beside, her; throwing the others to a delighted pig, who, like Lazarus, stood by, to pick up the leavings of his betters. In the yard, at the fountain\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty. The son of the dauphin is a noble youth, and, although his father was unfriendly to Austria, Choiseuil and La, Pompadour are for us. Marie Antoinette, therefore, is to be Queen of, France. This, however, must be a profound secret between ourselves., While her little highness is being fashioned for her future dignity, we, must marry her elder sisters, if not so brilliantly, at least as, advantageously as we can. First, then, upon the list is the Archduchess, Christina. We must find some suitable rank for herself and her husband\\n\\n\\\"Do you know,\\\" said he, \\\"what William the Silent once said of himself?, 'If I knew that my night-cap had found out my thoughts I would throw it, in the fire.' Now, Binder, do not aim to be my night-cap, or I shall, burn you to a cinder.--But enough of this. It would seem that the, Emperor Joseph expects me to wait upon him. Well--if it please him that, I should make the first visit, I will humor him. When a man feels that, he is lord and master of another, he can afford to be condescending! I, will indulge the emperor's whim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said she, aloud. \\\"No, it is not so. I am neither old nor ugly. The, light of youth has not yet fled from my brow. My beauty's sun has not, yet set forever. My Franz will love me still; and however charming, younger women may be, he will remember the beloved of his boyhood, and, we will yet be happy in reciprocal affection, come what may to us as, emperor and empress. I do not believe that he said he had never seen so, lovely a woman as Riccardo. Poor, dear Franz! He has a tedious life as, husband of the reigning sovereign. From sheer ennui he sometimes wanders, from his wife's heart, but oh! he must, he must return to me; for if I, were to lose him, earthly splendor would be valueless to me forever!\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor looked on and listened with an amused smile, highly diverted, at the avalanche of courtiers that came rushing on them from corridor, and staircase. Meanwhile the sovereigns pursued their way in solemn, silence until the brilliant throng had descended the marble stairs that, led from the terrace to the gardens. Then came another flourish of, trumpets, one hundred Swiss saluted the king, and twelve gardes de corps, advanced to take their places close to the royal promenaders.\\n\\nFor some time the poor young king sat in profound discouragement., Finally, with a long, weary sigh, he raised his head, and began to, reflect again. At last he solved he difficult problem. \\\"Ah!--I have it, now,\\\" thought he, heartily relieved. \\\"I will go to Madame Adelaide. She, was my mother's dearest friend and my father's favorite sister. She, shall be my counsellor. I believe that, with her assistance, I may, succeed in carrying out the policy dictated by my father.\\\"\\n\\ndishonored girl, she had slunk through the streets of Rome in search of, death--death and annihilation in the black waves of the Tiber. She felt, the waters engulf her, she heard her own death-cry, the last protest of, youth against self-destruction; and then she felt the grasp of, Podstadsky--Podstadsky who, in restoring her to the world, had laid a, new curse upon her life. Until then she had been luxurious, frivolous\\n\\nJust then the folding-doors were thrown wide open, and the steward, announced in a loud voice that the table of his lord the prince was, served. The company arose, and the ladies looked to see which of them, was to have the honor of being conducted to the table by the host., Kaunitz feigned neither to see nor to hear. He continued his, conversation with Noverre, and when he had quite done, he sauntered, carelessly up to his other guests. Suddenly he paused, and his eyes, wandered from one to another with a searching glance.\\n\\nBaron Binder looked after the page and shook his head. Kaunitz smiled., \\\"Enough of ambassadors for to-day. The ship of Austria lies proudly and, safely in the haven of her own greatness; and would you deprive the, pilot of a few hours of relaxation?

In fifteen minutes I await your highness here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What fables men do invent!\\\" exclaimed the king. \\\"A courier has just, arrived from the French embassy, in Vienna, with dispatches informing us, that Count von Mercy had received for your majesty one official letter, from the empress, and two private letters of instruction, one of which, contained a list of persons recommended by her majesty; and, finally, a, fourth missive, private, from the Emperor Joseph. And all this is pure, invention, Count von Mercy?\\\"\\n\\nThe empress heaved a sigh, and drew her mantilla over her face, as if to, shut out the future which was unrolling itself to her view. She felt, sick at heart; for she began to comprehend that her successor was not, only creating a new order of things, but was speaking with contempt of, his mother's reign. But she would not comtemplate the sad vision; she, strove to turn back her thoughts to the present.\\n\\n\\\"Which is beneath the dignity of the head of the church,\\\" interrupted, Pius. \\\"You can well imagine that I have already said as much to myself., I know, that in going to visit this proud man, I humble myself. But if, humility becomes any one of the servants of God, it becomes the, successor of Peter, and I have no right to shrink from personal, humiliation, when, perchance, it may win something from haughtiness in, favor of the church of God. Perhaps the advances I make to Kaunitz may, move his cold heart, and teach him to do unto others as others have done, unto him.\\\"\\n\\nCount Podstadsky was still in the elegant costume of the day. Graceful, and distinguished in his bearing, he leaned his weary body, against the, stake that supported the scaffold on which he was to suffer the last, degree of public infamy. But now the executioner approached, holding a, pair of large glistening shears. He gathered the soft brown curls of the, count in his rough grasp, and very soon the glossy locks fell, and there, remained nothing but the shorn head of the felon. This done, the, executioner drew off the gold-embroidered coat which became the young, nobleman so well, and threw over his shoulders the coarse smock, which\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sire; and it may be an hour of tribulation, unless your majesty, has the magnanimity to prevent it! To discourage idle assemblages, your, majesty has forbidden the people to follow funerals.

The police have done their best to disperse the, rioters, but so far in vain.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor approached, and tenderly strove to lift his mother, while he, lavished words of love and comfort upon her. She allowed him to lead, tier to a divan, where gradually the tempest of her grief gave place to, deep-drawn sighs, and, finally, to peace. The crisis, however, was long, and terrible, for the affections of Maria Theresa were as strong as her, will; and fierce had been the conflict between the two.\\n\\nHe dreamed on, while his tired men slept. Not all, however, for, far, toward the left wing of the army, a band of hussars were encamped around, a wagon laden with brandy, and, having much more confidence in the, restorative powers of liquor than of sleep, they had been invigorating, themselves with deep potations. Another company of soldiers in their, neighborhood, awakened by the noisy mirth of the hussars, came forward, to claim their share of the brandy. It was refused, and a brawl ensued\\n\\nThe countess was superbly dressed. A rich robe of velvet, embroidered, with gold, fell in heavy, glistening folds around her graceful figure; a, diadem of brilliants sparkled like a constellation upon the blackness of, her luxuriant hair, and her exquisite neck and arms were covered with, costly gems. She had just completed her toilet for a dinner given by the, Princess Karl Liechtenstein, when Podstadsky had met her with the, alarming intelligence which had obliged her to send an excuse.\\n\\n\\\"There spoke my Lacy, my own gallant Austrian!\\\" exclaimed Joseph. \\\"To, work, then, to work!

But I, would not listen. What cared I for future security? What mattered it to, me that I was to be the victim of Paul's vengeance?

Fill your glasses to the brim, and having done, honor to those who furnished our repast, allow me to propose--ourselves:, To the health of those who are about to eat a dinner which they have, earned by the sweat of their brow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And where you might realize your mother's touching dream of becoming a, boor, and repenting your sins in sackcloth and ashes! That maternal idyl, still troubles your poor, shallow brain, does it? For my part, I think, no spectacle on earth is so ridiculous as that of the repentant sinner., It is the most humiliating character in which a man can appear before, the world, and it is unworthy of you, Carlo. Hold up your head and look, this phantom of dancer in the face. It is but a phantom. The bright\\n\\nwhereon the lights, not yet extinguished, were dropping their waxen, tears from two lofty silver candelabra. At this table sat a man, looking, earnestly at a paper covered with notes of music. He had sat there the, whole night long, and his countenance gave no indication of the, exhaustion that follows upon night-watching. His large, dark, gray eyes, flashed whenever he raised his head thoughtfully, as he frequently did;, and when music was born of his thoughts, a smile illuminated his, otherwise plain face, and a wonderful light played about his magnificent, forehead; the glory of that genius which had made it her dwelling-place.\\n\\nSuddenly he ceased, and became very pale. He was sensible that he had, burst a blood-vessel, and he felt the warm stream of his life welling, upward, until it moistened his pallid lips. With a hasty movement he, drew out his handkerchief, held it for a moment before his mouth, and, then replaced it quickly in his bosom. Large drops of cold sweat stood, out from his brow, and the light faded from his eyes. But these haughty, Magyars should not see him fall! They should not enjoy the sight of his, sufferings!\\n\\nThe empress had started from her seat, and she now stood in the centre, of the room, earnestly gazing upon her husband and her child. Her, mother's heart beat wildly, and tears of tenderness suffused her eyes., She longed to speak some word of pardon to her son; but before all, things, Maria Theresa honored court ceremony. She would not, for the, world, that her subjects had seen her otherwise than self-possessed and, regal in her bearing.\\n\\nAt last the deep bells of St. Stephen's opened their brazen throats., This signified that the pope and the emperor were at the gates of the, city. The consent of the latter having been asked in the matter of the, bell-ringing, he had replied to Cardinal Megazzi: \\\"By all means. I, wonder you should ask me the question, when bells are the artillery of, the church.\\\" [Footnote: Friedel's Letters, vol. i., p. 213.]\\n\\nCoronini: you, whose loyalty is offended every time you address me as, Count Falkenstein. I only wonder that the sun did not hide its head, and, the earth tremble at the sacrilege! What do you suppose he called, me?--An ass! He did, I assure you. That little bare-legged boy called, his emperor an ass! Now, Coronini, do you think you can taste of the, strawberries that were gathered by those treacherous little hands?\\\"\\n\\nafter a pause, \\\"that I should still hear the language of courtly, falsehood? Awake, my friends, for this is not Austria's imperial, capital! It is the world which God created, and here upon our mother, earth we stand as man to mail. A little shining beetle is creeping on my, boot as familiarly as it would on the sabot of a base-born laborer. If, my divine right were written upon my brow, would not the insects, acknowledge my sovereignty, as in Eden they its golden wings and leave, me without a sign--Happy beetle! Would that I too had wings, that I, might flee away and be at rest!\\\"\\n\\nPrince Kaunitz stood in the centre of the room when the Russian minister, made his appearance. He raised his cold blue eyes with perfect, indifference to the smiling face of the Russian, who bowed low, while, his host vouchsafed him a slight inclination of the head. Prince, Gallitzin seemed to be as unconscious of this haughty reception as of, the fact that Kaunitz had not moved forward a singe step to greet him., He traversed with unruffled courtesy the distance that separated him, from Austria, and offered his hand with the grace of a finished, courtier.\\n\\nThe country was one vast desert. From every cottage went forth the wail, of hunger. The stalls were empty of cattle, the barns of corn. The, ploughs lay empty on the ground, for there was neither grain to sow nor, oxen to drive. There were neither men nor women to till the soil, for, there was no money to pay nor food to sustain them. Each man was alone, in his want, and each sufferer in the egotism of a misery that stifled, all humanity, complained that no one fed him, when all were fainting for, lack of food.\\n\\n\\\"You are a grown-up child, Binder; you stare, and believe every thing., Have you not yet learned that statesmanship recognizes nothing but, interests? To-day it is to the interest of Frederick to squeeze our, hands and protest that he loves us; to-morrow (if he can), he will put, another Silesia in his royal pocket. We, too, have found it convenient, to write him a love-letter or two; but to-day, if we would, we would, pluck off his crown, and make him a little margrave again! Our intimacy, reminds me of a sight I once saw while we were in Paris. It was a cage\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" replied the father, \\\"your majesty is about to rescue that beloved, son from destruction; but as your majesty is a loving mother, it, afflicts you to disappoint your child. Still, our Lord has commanded if, the right eye offend, to pluck it out; and so is it your majesty's duty, to pluck from your son's heart the evil growing there, even were his, heart's blood to follow. The wounds you may inflict upon your dear, child, for God's sake, will soon be healed by His Almighty hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" interrupted the emperor. \\\"You would not have me punish him for, being man enough to say to my face what thousands say of me behind my, back, would you? Now, I am so disinclined to punish him that I intend to, increase his pension just because he is an honest, plain-spoken fellow., You need not make such a grimace, Gunther. If you feel badly, console, yourself with your work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what, if another should execute what this Galician has conceived?\\\", continued the emperor, shuddering. \\\"What if, in his ignorance, another, one of these wild huntsmen should deem it his duty to take the life of, Frederick?\\\" The emperor grew pale with the thought, and his hand was, lifted as if to protest against the crime. \\\"I must find means to shield, myself from such disgrace, for his safety and my honor are cast on the, same die.\\\"\\n\\nyesterday, when the Countess Fuchs remonstrated with your highness, you, replied with an unseemly jest. You said, 'Dearest countess, I hope to, prove to you that, although I neglect my mass, I can be pious on the, battle-field. There, on the altar of my country, I mean to sacrifice, countless enemies, and that will be an offering quite as pleasing in the, sight of God.' Were those not your words, prince?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I accept the offer, and here is my hand. And so, hand in hand, we shall, conquer the world.

The empress is quite, ready to grant it, and has already marched an auxiliary force into, Galicia. But she exacts that her troops shall act independently of, Frederick, and requires of him for the prosecution of her war with, Turkey, a subsidy of two million of thalers. The king is indignant at, her exactions, so that the opportunity now offers to dissolve this, dangerous alliance. If the empress-queen could bring herself to pen a, letter to Catharine requesting her intervention--\\\"\\n\\nThirty persons, exclusive of Count Rosenberg and two other confidential, friends, accompanied the emperor. Of course, the incognito of a Count of, Falkenstein, who travelled with such a suite, was not of much value to, him; so that he had endured all the tedium of an official journey. This, was all very proper in the eyes of Maria Theresa, who thought it, impossible for Jove to travel without his thunder. But Jove himself, as, everybody knows, was much addicted to incognitos, and so was his terrene, representative, the Emperor of Austria.\\n\\nbowing. \\\"As to Poland, the great question there is to preserve the, balance of power. I beg, therefore, that Russia and Prussia will make, known at once the extent of their claims there, that Austria may shape, hers accordingly. I shall enter at once into correspondence with the, King of Prussia, to ascertain his views as to the future boundaries of, Poland. Two things are indispensable to insure the success of this, affair.\\\"\\n\\nThe visit of the emperor was drawing to a close. He had tasted to its, utmost of the enjoyments of the peerless city. He had become acquainted, with its great national institutions, its industrial resources, its, treasures of art and of science. The Parisians were enthusiastic in his, praise; from the nobleman to the artisan, every man had something to say, in favor of the gracious and affable brother of the queen. Even the, fish-wives, those formidable dames de la haile, had walked in procession, to pay their respects, and present him a bouquet of gigantic, proportions. [Footnote: On this occasion Madame Trigodin, one of the, most prominent of the poissurdes, made an address on behalf of the, sisterhood. Hubner, i., p. 151.]\\n\\nThe king laughed. \\\"I approve your policy,\\\" said he, \\\"but I am curious to, know how you would manage to prevent me from keeping my word. I am, certainly pledged to Russia, but I hope that the negotiations into which, we are about to enter will end in peace. I shall send a resume of our, conference to the empress, and use every effort to establish friendly, relations between you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And, yet, is ambitious to legislate. Oh, Catharine, beware of this old, king, who clings to you to support his own tottering royalty, and to, obstruct your schemes of conquest. But he will not succeed with you as, he has done by me. You have no mother to thrust you aside, while she, barters away your rights for a mess of pottage! I see your eagle, glance--it turns toward the south, where roll the stormy waves of the, Black Sea! I see this fair white hand as it points to mosques of, Constantinople, where the crescent is being lowered and the cross is, being planted--\\\"\\n\\nSince the intoxicating moment when Maria Theresa, in the presence of the, whole court, had named him co-regent, and delivered over to his hands, her vast empire, Joseph felt as if he had suddenly been transported to a, world of enchantment. He had, together with her ministers, dissuaded the, empress from her resolution of retiring to Innspruck; but even as he, joined his voice to theirs, his heart was trembling with fear lest she, should yield. He felt that if she revoked the power she had conferred\\n\\nHe began to write instructions for the use of his secretaries. They were, never to pronounce in his presence the two words DEATH and SMALL-POX. If, those words ever occurred in any correspondence or official paper that, was to come before his notice, they were to be erased. Those who, presented themselves before the prince were to be warned that these, fearful words must never pass their lips in his presence. A secretary, was to go at once to the Countess Clary, that she might prepare the, guests of the prince, and caution them against the use of the offensive, words. [Footnote: Hormayer, \\\"Austrian Plutarch,\\\" vol. xii., p. 374.]\\n\\nThe king shrugged his shoulders. \\\"And yet, it would appear that when, Zips lay at her feet, the Empress of Austria was ready to embrace it., But everybody grows eccentric when Poland is in question. My brother, Henry, who is in St. Petersburg, was one day discussing this matter of, the annexation of Zips with the empress. As Catharine, like myself, has, never had the privilege of examining the records in the court of, chancery at Vienna, she expressed some doubt as to the justice of, Austria's appropriation in that quarter. 'It seems,' said she, 'as if, one had noting to do but stoop down to pick up something in, Poland.'[Footnote: Ruthfore's \\\"History of Poland,\\\" vol. iv., p. 210.], Now, when proud Austria and her lofty Kaunitz condescend to stoop and, pick up, why shall not other people follow their example? I, too, shall, be obliged to march my troops into Poland, for every misfortune seems, about to visit this unhappy land. Who knows that in the archives at, Berlin there may not be some document to prove that I, also, have a, right to extend the lines of my frontier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have read your petition, and have found that you spoke the truth., From this day your father's pay falls to your mother; and at her death, it shall revert to you. I beg you both to forgive the tardiness of this, act of justice; for neither the empress nor I had ever heard that your, father had any family. Once more forgive us for all that you have, endured since his death. And now, my child, rise from your knees; for, human beings should kneel before God alone. Dry your tears, and hasten, to your mother. Tell her that the emperor is not as heartless as he has, been pictured to her by his enemies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Know my secret,\\\" said she, as she folded her hands and stood before her, outraged husband. \\\"And now hear me. A few months ago I had a beloved, brother, whom I loved the more that he was unfortunate and afflicted., From his childhood he had suffered from a malady which his physicians, called leprosy. The very servants deserted him, for it was said that the, disease was contagious. I loved my brother with devotion; I went to him, and nursed him until he died. God shielded me, for I did not take the, malady. But on my neck and back there came dark spots which, although, they are painful, are not contagious. My physicians tod me that my, strong constitution had rejected the leprosy, and these spots were a, regeneration of my skin, which would soon disappear. This, sire, is my, fatal secret; and now judge me. It is in your power to make me the, happiest of mortals, by granting me a generous pardon; but I will not, complain if you condemn and despise me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I waited so long for your majesty's regard, to earn it on account, of a silly peasant?\\\" said Kaunitz, with a bitter smile. \\\"I hope that I, shall have a niche in the temple of the world's esteem, even if I do, fail in finding the daughter of Conrad the boor. If your majesty has, never esteemed me before, you will not begin to do so today; and, as, regards your promised gratitude; the whole world knows, and your majesty, also knows, that I am not to be bribed; but I am ready, from the depths, of my own attachment to you, to do all that I can to help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have guessed,\\\" answered Maria Theresa, laughing. \\\"It is of your own, marriage that I would speak. I have accepted a crown for you, my, Caroline, and the ambassador who will conduct you to your kingdom is, already on his way. Your trousseau is magnificent and worthy of a queen., Your fair brow was made for a royal diadem, and in yonder room lies one, that is made up of a constellation of diamonds.\\\"\\n\\nand put my house in order. In that day I shall remember this interview, with the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\\" [Footnote: The two brothers never met, again. Although Leopold was next heir to the crown, Joseph would not, allow him to receive the title of King of Rome, but bestowed it upon, Leopold's son and heir, Francis. Even upon his death-bed the emperor, refused to see his brother. By his explicit commands, it was only when, his death had taken place, that a courier was sent to inform Leoold of, his accession to the throne.]\\n\\ntearful, despairing were these ghosts of an existence uncheckered by one, ray of happiness. Ah, with what a heart full of trembling hope had she, entered the walls of this palace, which to her had proved a prisoner's, cell! With what rapture had she heard the approaching step of that, high-born emperor, her husband, on their wedding-night; and oh, how, fearful and how swift had fallen the bolt of his vengeance upon her sin!, Memory whispered her of this.\\n\\nThe emperor laid his hands upon the shoulders of his friends, and looked, at them with unmistakable affection. \\\"Happy is the man who possesses two, such friends. But hear what I exact of you. I stand upon the threshold, of a new order of things. I am at last an emperor, free to carry out the, designs which for so many long years I have been forced to stifle in my, sorrowing heart. I am resolved to enlighten and to elevate my subjects., But if in my zeal to do well. I should lack discretion, it is for you to, check and warn me. And if I heed not your warnings, you shall persist\\n\\nTo-day the court was assembled in an apartment opening into the garden;, and the queen, who had just made her appearance in all the splendor of, her regal beauty, was the cynosure of attraction and of admiration. She, stood in the centre of the room, her eyes fixed wistfully upon the, setting sun, whose dying rays were flooding park, terrace, and even the, spot on which she stood, with a red and golden light. By her side stood, the king, his mild countenance illumined with joy and admiration of his, young wife's surpassing loveliness. On the other side of the queen were, the princes and princesses of the blood; and around the royal group an, assemblage of the youngest, prettiest, and sprightliest women of the, aristocracy, escorted by their cavaliers, young nobles whose rank\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty, I have had full time to reflect upon this weighty, question; for since first you announced your intention to resign the, throne, I have thought of nothing else. In politics we know neither, predilection nor prejudice. Necessity and interest decide all things., Your majesty has so often called me a good politician, that I have ended, by believing myself to be one. It follows thence that, in deliberating, upon this great question, I have laid aside all personal inclination and, sympathy, and have had in view the welfare of Austria alone. But for, this, the matter would have required no thought, for the Emperor Joseph, and I have nothing in common. He fears me, and I do not love him., [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Wrazall, vol. ii., p. 490.] We never, could be made to understand one another; for the language of the heart, is not to be forced by edicts, as is the language of the court. The, emperor has forbidden all tongues in Germany, save one. If he persist in, this, he will alienate his subjects, and Austria will soon lose her, greatness. When a titan intends to force his people to forget their, mother-tongue, he must do it by degrees; and if he succeeds, he will be, a skilful teacher. The best reforms are to be introduced through the, byways of life. If we trust them on the highway, they shock and terrify, the people. The young emperor, regardless of these considerations, has, violently suppressed whatever seemed injudicious to him in your, majesty's administration. Perhaps you had done too much; your son\\n\\n\\\"Unhappily for you, you know not what you claim,\\\" exclaimed the countess, angrily. \\\"Ask my uncle, ask his household, and they will tell you that I, am a tyrant, changing my will twenty times an hour; hating to-day the, thing I shall love to-morrow. You would aspire to be my husband, would, you? Have you no friends to warn you of the reefs upon which you are, running that poor little crazy bark of yours? Why the very people, as, they see me pass, tell of my frantic doings; and every child in Vienna, knows that I beat my servants, rage about my uncle's house like the foul, fiend, and dash through the streets on horseback like the Wild, Huntsman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord,\\\" said he, \\\"I have suffered cruelly since the sun rose to-day, but, oh! how I thank Thee that Thou hast preserved my name from eternal, infamy! How would the world have spurned me, if, refusing to give him, battle, I had taken the life of my enemy through the hands of an, Austrian soldier! My God! my God! the life of Frederick has become more, precious to me than my own--for HIS life is one with MY honor.\\n\\n\\\"Prince,\\\" said the signora, seriously, \\\"I learned the whole of this, scene from yourself; and in my relations with you I have followed the, example you gave me.

The whole, world knows of your double dealings with women, and calls you a, heartless young libertine.\\\"\\n\\nThe young countess took the arm of the prince, and they entered the, drawing-room. The guests had long been assembled there, but it never, occurred to Kaunitz to make any apology for his late appearance., Nevertheless, his guests were all noble; some of them representatives of, princely houses or powerful kingdoms. Kaunitz, however, was not only the, all-powerful minister of Maria Theresa; it was well known that his, slender, diamond-studded fingers directed the policy of all Europe. No, one in that room had the courage to resent his rudeness. All seemed to, feel honored as he walked haughtily forward with a slight inclination of, his head to the many, and a condescending smile to the few whom it, pleased him to distinguish by his notice.

You know nothing of the change, in your prospects--you have not as yet, received no orders to remain., Write to your mother, that, preferring to go without the grief of taking, leave, you have presumed to start tonight without her knowledge, hoping, soon to embrace her again, and lay your first-earned laurels at her, feet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"do not go. As commander-in-chief, you should be thoroughly acquainted, with the premises of our affair with Turkey, and you must hear both the, manifestoes which I an about to dictate. The first, of course, declares, war against the Porte. The second is, perhaps, a mere letter to the, successor of the great Frederick. His majesty of Prussia, foreseeing, in, his extreme wisdom, that I am likely to declare war against Turkey, is, so condescending as to offer himself as mediator between us!

As the king and his people left, my house, it was growing dark, so I slipped out.

The, queen seemed not to perceive the omission. She gave him her hand with a, sweet smile, and despite his ill-humor, Louis could not suppress a throb, as he saw how brilliantly beautiful she was.\\n\\nThe three powers which had lived so long at variance, had united, themselves in one common cause--the pacification of Poland. In vain had, Stanislaus refused his assent to their friendly intervention. In vain, had he appealed to England and France for help. Neither of these powers, was willing, for the sake of unhappy Poland, to become involved in a war, with three nations, who were ready to hurl their consolidated strength, against any sovereign who would have presumed to dispute their joint, action.\\n\\n\\\"True,\\\" sighed the signora, \\\"and this great Kaunitz it is who has, abandoned me. While I worshipped the air he breathed, he sat at the feet, of the Countess Clary, repeating to her the self-same protestations with, which an hour before he had intoxicated my senses. Oh, when I heard, this, jealousy and despair took possession of my soul. I was resolved to, be revenged, and so I permitted the advances of Count Palffy. Ha! while, I endured his presence, I felt that my heart was wholly and forever, yours! Oh, my adored, my great Kaunitz, say that you love me, and at, your feet I throw all the lesser Kaunitzes in token of my fealty!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" exclaimed Frederick, laughing and nodding to Kaunitz, \\\"now I am, satisfied. If I would rather have Loudon beside me, I would rather have, the greatest statesman in Europe before me, for it is only when I can, see him that I feel quite safe from his diplomatic grasp.

There, amid, burning wax-lights, was the hideous coffin that enclosed his beloved, one, and was about to bear away forever his life, his love, and his, happiness. When he saw the coffin, a stifled cry arose from his breast., He darted with open arms toward it, and, bending down, hid his face upon, the lid.\\n\\n\\\"Your highness, it is the impatience of a longing heart,\\\" said the, singer. \\\"Do you know that it seems to me a thousand years since last I, was allowed to enter these gates of Paradise! For eight days I have been, plunged in deepest sorrow, watching your carriage as it passed by my, house, snatching every note from my footman's hands in the hope that it, might be one from you--hoping in vain, and at last yielded myself up to, fell despair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all!\\\" cried Joseph.\\\" We must consult how we may soonest cast it, away from us. Your majesty will never require of me the sacrifice of, remaining bound to that woman. I obeyed your behest; and in spite of my, disinclination to a second marriage, I bent my will before the, necessities of diplomacy, and the command of my sovereign. But we are, now on a ground where the duty of a subject ends, and the honor of a man, stands preeminent. I never will consent to be the husband of this woman, whose person is disgusting to me. Far above all claims of political, expediency, I hold my right as a man.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph laughed. \\\"Dominick Kaunitz\\\" said he, \\\"you are the son of your, respected father, no doubt of it; for you behave prettily before the, bare walls themselves.

So Cocceji, went down on his knees and kissed his hand, and called him his lord and, king, and the people of the mill, who had never dreamed who it was, all, dropped on their knees and begged for mercy. So the king then forgave, everybody, and went back to Warsaw with Cocceji.

I send you, copies of our correspondence, and will continue to do so regularly., Hoping that God in His goodness will restore to me my imperial son, I, remain now as ever, your affectionate mother and empress, \\\"MARIA, THERESA.\\\"\\n\\nThe empress smiled kindly upon the speaker. \\\"I know that you are, inclined to religion,\\\" said she, \\\"and I am glad that you have had so, good an influence over the Countess Julia, for she is not wont to be too, zealous at prayer. I will remember you both for your piety, dear, children and will see that you are both well married. There is the young, Baron of Palmoden and Count--\\\"\\n\\nbut the grace and abandon of her attitude, as she leaned back in her, velvet arm-chair. She had not long been seated when the door of the box, opened, and a young man entered whom the lady greeted with a cordial, smile. Every one knew the visitor to be Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein., the richest, haughtiest, and handsomest cavalier in all Vienna., Podstadsky was the son of a distinguished nobleman, high in the, emperor's favor; he had just returned from his travels, and all the, Viennese gallants were eager to imitate him in every thing. To see him, in the box of the beautiful stranger was to fire the ambition of every, man to know her; the more so that the haughty Podstadsky, instead of, accepting a seat, was standing in an attitude of profound respect, which, he maintained until he took his leave.\\n\\nyou are the last love of an unfortunate man, whom the world calls an, emperor, but who lies at your feet, as the beggar before his ideal of, the glorious Madonna! Bend to me, Madonna, and let me drink my last, draught of love! I shall soon have quaffed it, and then--your father, will be here to remind me that you are a high-born countess, the, priceless treasure of whose love I may not possess! Kiss me, my Therese\\n\\n\\\"I believe that you are the man for Austria,\\\" said she. \\\"I believe that, together we can carry out our plans and projects. God grant that they be, righteous and just in His sight! You have read my heart, and you know, that I can never reconcile myself to the loss of Silesia. You know that, between me and Frederick no harmony can ever exist; no treaty can ever, be signed to which he is a party. [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words.], I will take the hand of France, not so much for love of herself as for, her enmity to Prussia. Will you work with me to make war on Frederick if, I appoint you sole minister, Kaunitz? For I tell you that I burn to, renew my strife with the King of Prussia, and I would rather give him, battle to-day than to-morrow.\\\" [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words., Coxe.]\\n\\nThe duke was entirely alone. He had dismissed his attendants, and now, stood in the centre of the room, awaiting his daughter in gloomy, silence. His cold, stern features had grown more repulsive than ever to, the unhappy girl; his piercing eyes more revengeful; his thin, pale lips, more cruel. He seemed to her a pitiless stranger, and she could not, advance to meet him. Powerless and faint, she stood at the door; all her, strength gone.\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" exclaimed the emperor. \\\"He who is not ashamed of the crime will, not be ashamed of the disgrace. If, for the sake of his rank, a man is, to have the privilege of being a villain, where, then, is justice?, [Footnote: Ibid.] Not another word of this! My forbearance is exhausted;, for I have sought by every means to convince you that, as a sovereign, I, shall show partiality to no order of men. Podstadsky and Szekuly shall, suffer to the full extent of the law, for the worth of their ancestors, cannot wipe out their own unworthiness.\\\"\\n\\nThese ordinances did away with the influence of the head of the church, in Austria, but they did not sufficiently destroy that of the clergy, over their flocks. This, too, must be annihilated; and now every thing, was ready for the great final blow which was to crush to the earth every, vestige of church influence within the dominions of Joseph the Second., This last stroke was the dispersion of the religious communities. Monks, and nuns should be forced to work with the people. They were no longer, to he permitted to devote their lives to solitary prayer, and every, contemplative order was suppressed.\\n\\n\\\"If your majesty does that, a war with France will be the consequence of, your frankness. France has promised succor to the Confederates, and has, already sent Dumouriez with troops, arms, and gold. France is longing to, have a voice in the differences between Russia and Turkey, and she only, awaits cooperation from Austria to declare openly against Russia. She, will declare against ourselves, if, after your majesty's promises, we, suddenly change front and take part against the seditious Poles.\\\"\\n\\nbecause free from the prejudices of religion, will belong to enlightened, Prussia; the southern half, the bigoted Catholic portion, that which, believes in the pope and his Jesuits, may perhaps adhere to Austria., Then comes revolution. Prussia will have for her allies, not only, northern Germany, but Sweden, England, Holland, Denmark, even Russia., Every step she takes in advance will drive back Austria; and the day may, come when Prussia, our powerful enemy, will seek for the Margrave of, Brandenburg the crown of the Kaisers.\\\"\\n\\nWhen he recovered from the violence of the fall, he found himself, unhurt, but alone. Not one of his suite was to be seen; in the mad rush, of the men for the crossing, they had been parted from him. The little, rustic bridge bad fallen in, and those who remained behind had rushed, with frantic yells in search of some other crossing. The emperor could, hear their cries in the distance, and they filled his heart with anguish, inexpressible.\\n\\n\\\"But a successor who will overturn all that his mother has done for, Austria's welfare. Your majesty laid the foundations of Austria's, greatness. To that end you called me to the lofty station which I now, occupy. Remember that together we pledged our lives and love to Austria., Be not untrue to the covenant. In the name of that people which I then, represented, I claim from their emperor, Maria Theresa, the strict, fulfilment of her bond. I call upon her to be true to her duty as the, ruler of a great nation, until the hand of God releases her from her, crown and her life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would that you spoke the truth!\\\" returned Isabella sadly. \\\"Had my heart, been capable of loving, I would have loved him long ago--him, whose, noble and confiding love is at once my pride and my grief. Believe me, when I tell you that in these few years of married life I have suffered, terribly. I have striven with my sorrows, I have tried to overcome the, past, I have desired to live and to enjoy life--but in vain. My heart, was dead, and could not awake to life--I have only suffered and waited, for release.\\\"\\n\\nAn angry murmur was heard, and every eye looked defiance at the emperor., \\\"Ah,\\\" said he, scornfully, \\\"you would ape the Polish diet, and dispute, the will of your king! You remember how the King of Poland succumbed to, dictation! I am another and a different man, and I care neither for your, approbation nor for your blame. It is my purpose to make Hungary, prosperous, and therefore I have abolished the feudal system which is, unfavorable to the development of the resources of the country. You, Magyars would interfere with me. You have a constitution at variance, with my laws, and for the sake of a piece of rotten parchment three, hundred years old, Hungary must be suffered to remain uncivilized, forever! Away with your mediaeval privileges and rusty escutcheons! A, new century has dawned, and not only the nobly born shall see its light\\n\\nFrom her cabinet council the empress passed at once to her private, apartments. When business was over for the, day, she loved to cast the, cares of sovereignty behind, and become a woman--chatting with her, ladies of honor over the \\\"on dits\\\" of the court and city. During the, hours devoted to her toilet, Maria Theresa gave herself up unreservedly, to enjoyment. But she was so impetuous, that her ladies of honor were, never quite secure that some little annoyance would not ruffle the, serenity of her temper. The young girl whose duty it was to read aloud, to the empress and dress her hair, used to declare that she would sooner, wade through three hours' worth of Latin dispatches from Hungary, than, spend one half hour as imperial hair-dresser.\\n\\n\\\"Rebellion in Tyrol, in Hnngary, in the Netherlands!\\\" murmured the, emperor, when he found himself alone. \\\"From every side I hear my, death-knell! My people would bury me ere I have drawn my last sigh. My, great ancestor, Charles, stood beside his open grave, and voluntarily, contemplated his last resting-place; but I! unhappy monarch, am forced, into mine by the ingratitude of a people for whom alone I leave lived!, Is it indeed so? Must I die with the mournful conviction that I have, lived in vain? O my God, what excess of humiliation Thou hast forced, upon me! And what have I done to deserve such a fate? Wherein have I, sinned, that my imperial crown should have been lined with so many cruel, thorns? Is there no remedy? must I drink this last bitter chalice? Must, I revoke that which I have published to the world as my sovereign will?\\\"\\n\\nmy lord and emperor,\\\" said he, \\\"I had heard of tears of joy, but, until, to-day, I knew not what they meant. I have been scourged for refusing to, kneel to my lord; but I bend the knee to you for I feel that you are a, mighty sovereign and a merciful father to your people. God bless you for, the words by which you have recognized our right to live and to be, free!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you hold them with unbecoming language,\\\" replied the empress, who, did not at all relish the tone of the King of Rome. \\\"And let me tell, you, my royal son, that an upright and honorable prince thinks less of, his rights as a man than of his duties as a ruler. He strives, while a, prince, to be a man; and while a man, to sacrifice his inclinations to, the calls of a princely station.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty is pleased to speak of the county of Zips. Zips has always, belonged to Hungary. It was mortgaged by the Emperor Sigismund to his, brother-in-law ZVladislaw Jagello for a sum of money. Hungary has never, parted with her right to this country; and, as we have been compelled to, send troops to our frontier to watch Russia, the opportunity presents, itself for us to demonstrate to Poland that Austria can never consent to, regard a mortgaged province as one either given or sold. Zips belongs to, Austria, and we will pay back to the King of Poland the sum for which it, was mortgaged. That is all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If ingratitude do not blind it to truth. It is hard to find daylight in, the labyrinth of established faith. I, too, have wandered in this, labyrinth, but in all my divarications I sought for Truth. With, passionate longing I called her to my help. Far removed from the hum of, human imbecility, down among the solitudes of untrodden forests I sought, her. Here I was face to face with Nature, and listened for response to, the anxious questionings of my restless heart. It was well for me that, the trees were the only witnesses of my agitation, for my fellow-men\\n\\nHer father affected not to hear her. \\\"Yes,\\\" continued he, \\\"she will, verify my promise, and take the husband I have chosen. This marriage, will be a fine thing for both parties, for I give my daughter one-half, million of florins, and Baron von Meyer gives his son a million cash, down. Then the father-in-law gives three hundred florins a month for, pin-money, and I seven hundred; so that Rachel has a thousand florins a, month for her little caprices, and of this she is to render no account., That is a pretty dower for a bride. I give my daughter a trousseau equal, in magnificence to that of a princess. Upon her equipage, the arms of, our two houses are already emblazoned, and to-morrow four of the finest, horses in Vienna will conduct the Baroness von Meyer to her husband's, palace. I congratulate you, baroness. No Christian woman in Vienna shall, have an establishment like yours.\\\"\\n\\nThe other was a tall, gaunt man, in the dress of court maestro de, capello. His lean face was proud and serious, his large mouth wore an, expression of scorn, and his full-orbed, light-blue eyes had a glance of, power which accorded well with his lofty stature. The two advanced arm, in arm toward the railing, and, at their appearance, a storm of applause, arose from the parterre, while the partisans of the Italian school, cried; \\\"Long live Hasse! Long live Metastasio!\\\"\\n\\nWhether Frederick had intended to prove to his officers that he was as, bold a horseman as ever, or whether be had yielded to a momentary, impulse of anger, he suffered keenly for his bravado; for at every bound, of the horse, his agony increased. Finally he could endure no more. He, came to a complete stand, and requested his suite to slacken their pace., They rode on in perfect silence, the officers casting stolen glances at, the king, whose lips quivered, while his face grew every moment paler, with suppressed anguish. But he bore it all without a sigh, until they, had reached the point for which they started. Having accurately surveyed, it, Frederick turned his horse's head, and rode back to his quarters.\\n\\nhe bowed again and passed on. But his face no longer wore its expression, of careless gratification. He grew absent and thoughtful; he forgot to, return the greetings of the people; and vainly the ladies, who crowded, window and balcony, threw flowers in his way, or waved their, handkerchiefs in greeting. He saw nothing but the beautiful vision in, the black veil, and wondered whence she came and what could be the, hidden meaning of the red and white flowers which she wore and gave to, him.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, my son,\\\" cried the empress, surveying the beautiful suite, \\\"you, have decorated these rooms with the taste and prodigality of a woman. It, adds much to my enjoyment of their beauty to think that all this is the, work of your loving hands. But one thing has my princely son forgotten;, and therein he betrays his sex, showing that he is no woman, but in very, truth a man.\\\"\\n\\nHe threw his arms around her, and pressed his hot, parched lips to hers., Again she disengaged herself, and her musical laugh rang out upon the, stillness--clear, merry, silvery as ever. \\\"Die! Are you tired of, pleasure? I am not. I shall yet have many an intoxicating draught from, its golden beaker. Die! As if we knew what came after death! But come; I, pity your state of mind, and since you can no longer be happy in Vienna\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, if your majesty works as you have done of late, your chance, for life is not very great. You seem to forget that mind is subordinate, to matter--not matter to mind--that physical nature must have her, rights, and no man can withstand her exactions. Pardon me these bold, words, sire, but if I speak at all, I must speak the truth. You have, begun a gigantic edifice, and if you die, it must remain forever, incomplete.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall make good use of it, too. Our coffers need replenishing, and, the emperor will rejoice to see them filled with the gold of the, infidel. It will enable him to raise and equip a gallant army, and that, will give him such unbounded delight that we are sure of his signature., Besides this, the Porte presents us with a goodly portion of Wallachia;, he fixes the boundaries of Transylvania to our complete satisfaction\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my beloved!\\\" murmured she, \\\"you hope every thing from the, magnanimity of the emperor. But in what blessed clime was ever a Jewess, permitted to wed with a Christian? The emperor may remove the shackles, of our national bondage, but he can never lift us to social equality, with the people of another faith. There is nothing to bridge the gulf, that yawns between my beloved and me. It would kill my father to know, that I had renounced Judaism, and I would rather die than be his, murderer. Oh, my father! oh, my lover! My heart lies between you, and, yet I may not love you both!--But which must I sacrifice to the other?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All this has no reference to Austria,\\\" objected the emperor. \\\"We had, nothing to do with the selection of the king--nothing to do with the, projects of dismemberment. They were resolved upon, with or without our, sanction, and the law of self-preservation demands that if we cannot, prevent, we must endeavor to profit by them. I know that the partition, of Poland has an appearance of gross outrage which is obvious to every, eye; while the stringent necessity which has driven Austria to, participate in it is known to few. I confess that I would be grieved if, the world should misjudge me on this question; for I try, both in public, and private life, to be an honest man; and I believe that honesty in, statesmanship is the wisest and soundest policy. [Footnote: The, emperor's own words. See Raumer, \\\"Contributions,\\\" &c., Vol. iv., p., 539.] We could not do otherwise than we have done, and now, with the, full conviction of the exigency which has called for the act, I repeat, my question to your majesty, have you signed the act, or will you be so, kind as to sign it now?\\\"\\n\\nThe people seemed wild with joy, and nobody vouchsafed a thought to the, memory of the \\\"Bien-aime,\\\" whose body was even now being taken to its, last rest, in the vaults of St. Denis. The funeral train was any thing, but imposing. The coffin, placed upon a large hunting-wagon, was, followed by two carriages, containing the Duke d'Ayen, the Duke, d'Aumont, and two priests. Twenty pages and as many grooms closed the, procession, which went along without attracting the notice of anybody., The burial-service was read in the crypt, and the coffin hastily lowered, in the vault, which was not only walled up, but cemented also, for fear, the infection imprisoned within might escape from the dungeon of the, dead and infest the abodes of the living.\",\n          \"Ten minutes later the crowd was on the way to the river, to a dock, where lay the motor-boat. It was not a very elegant craft, but it had, a good engine and could travel well--and that, just then, meant, everything to the Rover boys. A bargain was struck for the run, and, the boys and the owner got aboard. And then the search for the, schooner was begun anew.\\n\\nA short while later an alarming thing occurred. The boys were out in, the Dartaway when they met Grace on the road and learned that Dora and, Nellie had been abducted by Josiah Crabtree, Tad Sobber, and some of, their other old enemies. They gave chase in the biplane, and, after, several adventures, located the girls in a lonely mansion in the, country, where they were prisoners, in charge of Sobber's aunt The, boys at once went for the authorities, and, after something of a, fight, the rascals were made prisoners, and the girls were rescued and, taken back to the Seminary.\\n\\nFollowing the sending out of the invitations to the wedding, presents, had come in thick and fast to the Stanhope home. From Dick's father, came an elegant silver service, and from his brothers a, beautifully-decorated dinner set; while Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, contributed a fine set of the latest encyclopaedias, and a, specially-bound volume of the uncle's book on scientific farming! Mr., Anderson Rover also contributed a bank book with an amount written, therein that nearly took away Dora's breath.\\n\\nThere were two matters of importance--the irrigation scheme and the, purchase of a large tract of land which would be benefited by the flow, of water, when the irrigation plant was put into operation. In both of, the schemes the Rovers held large interests--that is, they held what, were called options, for which Anderson Rover had put up large sums of, money, and he had likewise induced some friends to let him put up, money for them. In order to clinch their hold on the two business, propositions Anderson Rover must sign certain papers and have them, delivered to the right parties inside of the next three days. Should, he fail to do this, then his options on the property would terminate\\n\\n\\\"Um! Nervous, eh? Well, a few days of quietness will remedy that,\\\", answered the lawyer. \\\"Now, see here.\\\" He looked wisely at the three, Rovers. \\\"Our railroad disclaims all responsibility for this accident., But at the same time we--er--we want to do the right thing, you, know--rather do that than have any unpleasant feelings, understand?, Now if you are willing to accept our offer, we'll fix this matter, right up and say no more about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow morning?\\\" Tom heard him ask \\\"What time? Ten o'clock. That, is rather early, but I can go there directly from my home.\\\" There came, another pause. \\\"Leave that to me,\\\" cried the man. \\\"I'll make him do, it!\\\" He paused again. \\\"I am not afraid of those boys,\\\" he added. \\\"I'll, be there, sure.\\\" Another pause. \\\"Yes, the boat is the best place., Nobody can disturb us there. Good-bye.\\\" And then the man hung up the, telephone receiver.\\n\\n\\\"The two brokers are in that room,\\\" whispered Dick, pointing to the, door of the apartment. \\\"They are planning to skip out to Canada and, leave their affairs in the hands of the lawyer who has rented this, apartment. He is almost as much of a rascal as any of them, for he is, to take their power of attorney dated some days back, and is going to, try to prove an alibi for them. I heard 'em arrange the whole thing.\\\"\\n\\nHe and Jesse Pelter hustled Anderson Rover back, and then the boys saw, their father disappear from view. Swiftly the tug and the schooner, gathered headway. The boys shouted in vain. They looked around for, some other boat to come to their aid, but none was in sight. Then the, schooner passed down the Hudson River and the Rover boys were left in, the rowboat, gazing at each other in dismay.\\n\\nIt must not be thought that in those days the girls at Hope Seminary, were forgotten. Whenever the Rover boys got a chance they visited the, place, and many a nice time they and the girls had together. On those, occasions Dick and Dora would roam off together, the others making no, attempt to follow them, and the pair would plan the many things they, hoped to do in the future.\\n\\n\\\"I've got the front room all ready for you,\\\" went on the aunt. And she, led the way into the house and to the apartment in question. Here the, sufferer was put to bed, and his aunt did all in her power to make him, comfortable. The local doctor had already been notified, and soon he, appeared, to read a note written by the city specialist and listen to, what Sam had to tell him. Then he took charge and said Tom must be, kept very quiet.\\n\\nHe had already given the particulars of how he had been kidnapped, while on his way to meet Japson. The broker had come up accompanied by, the disguised Crabtree, and he had been forced into a taxicab and a, sponge saturated with chloroform had been held to his nose. He had, become unconscious, and while in that condition had been taken to some, house up in Harlem. From there he had been transferred to the Ellen, Rodney on the evening before the boys had discovered his whereabouts.\\n\\nThis term at Putnam Hall was followed by a long journey on land and, sea, to a far-away island of the Pacific, where the boys and their, friends had to play \\\"Robinson Crusoe\\\" for a while. Then they returned, to this country, and, in a houseboat, sailed down the Ohio and the, Mississippi Rivers. After leaving the Mississippi they took an outing, on the plains, and then went down into southern waters, where, in the, Gulf of Mexico, they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.\\n\\n\\\"Not exactly, Dora--and yet I don't think I am exactly fitted for a, professional career. That seems to be more in Tom and Sam's line. I, like business, and I'd enjoy getting into something big, something, worth while. I think I could handle those matters, if father would, only let me try. And then there is another thing, Dora,\\\" went on the, youth, looking squarely into his companion's face. \\\"Perhaps you can, guess what that is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After a while Pelter and Japson came to me and said they must come up, the river--that a sister of the crazy man lived up here, and they, must visit her before they went down the coast. I was suspicious, but, what could I do? I had chartered my vessel and I had my money, so I, obeyed orders. Then we came up here as fast as we could. The steam tug, was dismissed, and we came ashore to this place. Then they hired an, auto and went off--and that's all I know about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to leave you out--I want you to be doing something, else, for we have no time to lose in this matter. I want you, Sam, to, come with me, and when I go into the offices, I want you to hang, around outside and watch for old Crabtree. If he is in league with the, brokers he may be looking for a chance to interview them, but he will, be on his guard, knowing that we are here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get a chance to listen. As I was coming up I saw the first, man give the second man some money. Then the second man looked up and, saw me, and shoving the money into his pocket, he dove across the, street and into the crowd. That made me feel sure it was Crabtree, and, I ran after him pell-mell. I followed him for about half a block. But, the crowd was too much for me, and he got away. I was going to tell a, policeman, but then I thought he couldn't do any more than I could\\n\\nFour days later the youngest Rover got permission from the specialist, who had attended Tom to take him home. An easy-riding automobile was, procured, and in this the two brothers drove to the nearest railroad, station. A compartment in a parlor car had already been engaged, and, Tom was placed in this and made as comfortable as circumstances, permitted. The ride was a long and tedious one for the youth, and by, the time he had made the necessary changes to get to Oak Run he was, pretty well exhausted, and had a severe headache.\\n\\nand also a full supply of table and other linen. From Captain Putnam, came a handsome morris chair, and Songbird sent in a beautifully-bound, volume of household poetry, with a poem of his own on the flyleaf. The, students of Brill sent in a fine oil painting in a gold frame, and the, girls at Hope contributed an inlaid workbox with a complete sewing, outfit. From Dan Baxter, who had been invited, along with the young, lady to whom he was engaged, came two gold napkin rings, each suitably, engraved. Dan had written to Dick, saying he would come to the wedding, if he had to take a week off to get there, he being then in Washington, on a business trip.\\n\\nDuring the past year a room had been added to the house and this was, used as a library and sort of office combined, being provided with a, substantial safe and two roller-top desks. One of the desks was used, exclusively by Anderson Rover for his private letters and papers. When, sick the man had given Dick the extra key to the desk, telling him to, keep it. The father trusted his three sons implicitly, only keeping to, himself such business affairs as he thought would not interest them.\\n\\nAlarmed, Tom picked up the tall, thin form and carried the man into, the house, for it was still raining, although not as hard as before., He placed Crabtree on an old couch in the sitting room and, getting, some water, laid a wet cloth over his bruised and swelling forehead., Knowing but little about broken limbs, he did not attempt to do, anything for the broken leg but placed that member out in a somewhat, straight position. He called up to Dick and told his brother of what, had happened.\\n\\nThe talk in the apartment went on, covering the things Belright Fogg, was to do while Pelter and Japson were in hiding in Canada. The, unscrupulous lawyer was to produce a power of attorney dated some days, before, so that he might act in place of the brokers. He was also to, do his best to help the brokers prove an alibi when accused of the, abduction of Anderson Rover.\\n\\nThe wedding was to take place at high noon, and long before that time, the many guests began to assemble at the church. Among the first to, arrive was Captain Putnam, in military uniform, and attended by about, a dozen of the Hall cadets. George Strong, the head teacher, was also, present, for he and Dick had always been good friends. Then came the, students from Brill, all in full dress, and led by William Philander, Tubbs, bedecked as only that dudish student would think of bedecking, himself.\\n\\nA discussion lasting the best part of half an hour ensued. The aviator, went up to four hundred dollars and then to four hundred and fifty., Finally, Dick said he would accept five hundred dollars cash; and the, bargain was concluded at that figure. The money was paid over, and the, Rover boys gave the purchaser a bill of sale, and he departed without, delay, stating he wished to make arrangements for shipping the wrecked, biplane away.\\n\\nSam and Tom got aboard and willing hands grasped the propellers and, gave each a twist. Bang! bang! bang! went the explosions, and soon the, propellers were revolving swiftly, and then with a swoop the Dartaway, ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose in the air. A, cheer went up, and the students threw up their caps. Then Dick swung, around in a quarter circle and headed directly for Plankville.\\n\\nYears before, and while their father was in Africa, the three boys had, been sent by their uncle to Putnam Hall Military Academy, as related, in detail in the first volume of this series, called \\\"The Rover Boys, at School.\\\" At the Hall they had made a number of friends, including, Songbird Powell and the dudish student, William Philander Tubbs. They, had also made some enemies, who did their best to bring the Rover boys, to grief, but without success.\\n\\nRunning along in the air is a different proposition from running on, the ground, and the air-man has to be careful about the lay of the, land below him or he will soon go astray from his course. The earth, looks altogether different when viewed from the sky from what it does, when looked at from a level, and when an air-man is five or six, hundred feet up he has all he can do to make out what is below him.\\n\\n\\\"I said this morning I had an idea, Tom,\\\" answered his big brother. \\\"I, don't know whether it will work out or not, or if you'll care to try, it. You know I told you to go to Central Park while Sam and I went, down to those offices. I did that so that those brokers wouldn't see, you. They don't know you, and you can go down and interview them as a, stranger. Do you catch the idea?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the Dartaway is gone--our dear old flying machine!\\\" groaned Tom., \\\"The machine we hoped to fly in to Washington, to the next, inauguration. Why, don't you know that the planes of that machine were, covered with the autographs of most of the big men of this country?, Whenever we sailed around to visit our friends or the big men we had, them write their autographs on the canvas wings of the machine. Those, autographs alone were worth about a million, more or less!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, something is bound to happen to those boys!\\\" murmured the aunt., \\\"You simply can't hold them in!\\\" And something did happen, and what is, was will be related in the next volume of this series, to be entitled:, \\\"The Rover Boys in Alaska; Or, Lost in the Fields of Ice.\\\" In that, book we shall learn how Tom suddenly lost his mind and wandered away, from home, and what strenuous things happened to Dick and Sam when, they went after their brother.\\n\\nfor a few days later William Philander and Clarabel Ruggles were seen, out driving together and apparently as friendly as over. The dudish, student had sent the young lady a letter stating he thought some of, his fellow collegians had doctored the box of candy, and this, explanation was accepted by the girl and her aunt. Then William, Philander sent the girl some candy he was sure was all right, and also, a big bouquet of roses; and that was the end of the unpleasantness.\\n\\nAfter that the captain was quite willing to talk, and he told how, Crabtree and Japson had come to him and questioned him about the, schooner, and finally chartered the craft for a week. They had at, first wanted to pay him at the end of the time, but he had insisted, upon receiving his money in advance and it was then paid over. He had, been told that the strange man was Crabtree's brother, who had gone, crazy because of the loss of his money in a Western irrigation scheme.\\n\\nA term at college had been followed by a trip down East, taken for a, peculiar reason, and then, while on a visit home, the three lads had, become the possessors of an up-to-date biplane, which they named the, Dartaway. In the biplane, as related in the volume before this, called, \\\"The Rover Boys in the Air,\\\" our heroes made a somewhat spectacular, trip from the farm to the college campus, much to the amazement of, their fellow collegians and their instructors. Later they made a trip, through the air to Hope Seminary, and at that time Dick was delighted, to place upon Dora's finger a diamond engagement sing.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get the chance,\\\" returned the youngest Rover, answering the, last question first. \\\"It was on the corner below here. I was standing, in a doorway, watching up and down, when I saw a tall man come along, slowly. He halted at the corner and presently another man came out of, the side street and touched him on the arm. The second man wore a, heavy beard and a slouch hat and colored eyeglasses, but I am almost, sure it was Josiah Crabtree.\\\"\\n\\nDick had the address of the brokers in his pocket and the place was, easily found. The offices were located in an old building--one of the, oldest on the street, and also one of the shabbiest. But it was five, stories in height and boasted of two elevators, and was, from, appearances, filled with prosperous tenants. In Wall street rents are, so high that many a person doing business there is willing to take, whatever quarters he can get.\\n\\n\\\"No, I was out of town--calling on my mother, who is very old and, quite sick. There was a fire in the pantry off the kitchen, and for a, few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground. Of, course the guards got excited, and all they thought of was to put out, the blaze--and it's a good thing they did that. That's how the, prisoners got away. I suppose you've heard that we rounded up two of, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is fairly well, but he gets a bad spell ever so often, and then to, attend to business is out of the question. But that isn't the worst of, it. He has gotten tangled up in some sort of financial scheme with, some brokers in New York City and it is worrying him half to death. He, has told me something about it, but I don't know half as much as I'd, like to know.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dartaway had a powerful motor, and once on the right trail the, eldest Rover advanced his gasoline and spark, and they went rushing, through the air at express-train speed. The boys were provided with, face guards, so they did not mind this. They did not fly high, and so, kept the railroad and other familiar objects fairly well in view. They, passed over several villages, the inhabitants gazing up at them in, open-mouthed wonder, and finally came in sight of a big church spire, that they knew belonged in Plankville. Then Dick slowed down the, engine, and soon they floated down in an open field close to the main, street and not a great distance from the sheriff's office and the, jail.\\n\\nA term at school had been followed by a short cruise on the ocean, and, then a trip to the jungles of Africa, whither the lads went to find, their father, who had disappeared. Then, during vacation, the boys, took a trip West, and then another trip on the Great Lakes. After that, they went in the mountains, and then came back to Putnam Hall, to go, into camp with their fellow cadets.\\n\\n\\\"In the morning, about ten o'clock. He came down in one of the, elevators with a small package in his hand--a package, so the, elevator man said, that looked like some legal documents. He seemed to, be very much disturbed, and the man said he talked to himself. He, hurried out of the side door of the hotel, but one of the doormen saw, him go to the corner and turn down Broadway--and that was the last, seen of him, so far as we knew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We ought to get a message from New York soon,\\\" remarked Dick, after, his uncle had related the little he had to tell about how Anderson, Rover had gone away on the trip to the metropolis. Evidently Randolph, Rover knew little about the business that had taken his brother to the, city. He was no business man himself--being wrapped up in what he, called scientific farming--and probably the boys' father had not, thought it worth while to take him into his confidence.\\n\\nAs my old readers well know, Dan Baxter was an old acquaintance of the, Rover boys. When at Putnam Hall he had been a great bully, and had, tried more than once to get the best of our heroes. But he had been, foiled, and then he had drifted to the West and South, and there the, Rovers had found him, away from home and practically penniless. They, had set him on his feet, and he had gotten a position as a traveling, salesman, and now he counted the Rovers his best friends, and was, willing to do anything for them.\\n\\nIn those days Josiah Crabtree had been an instructor at Putnam Hall., He was very dictatorial, and none of the cadets liked him, and the, Rovers liked him still less when they learned that he was trying to, practically hypnotize Mrs. Stanhope into marrying him, so that he, could get control of the fortune which the widow was holding in trust, for Dora. They foiled the teacher's efforts to wed the lady, and in, the end Josiah Crabtree had to leave Putnam Hall. Later still he was, arrested for some of his misdeeds and given a short sentence in jail.\\n\\nThe Stanhope fortune, as a part of the money coming to the Stanhopes, and the Lanings was called, had come to Mr. Stanhope in a peculiar, way, and some outsiders claimed the treasure, which, at that time, was, secreted in a spot among the West Indies called Treasure Isle. There, was a lively chase to get there first, but the Rovers won out, and, because of this their enemies were more bitter than ever.\\n\\nAs I have mentioned several times, in other volumes, this line was, started with the publication of \\\"The Rover Boys at School,\\\" \\\"On the, Ocean\\\" and \\\"In the Jungle.\\\" The cordial reception afforded the stories, called for the publication of the next volume, \\\"The Rover Boys Out, West,\\\" and then, year after year, by the issuing of \\\"On the Great, Lakes,\\\" \\\"In Camp,\\\" \\\"On Land and Sea,\\\" \\\"On the River,\\\" \\\"On the Plains,\\\", \\\"In Southern Waters,\\\" \\\"On the Farm,\\\" \\\"On Treasure Isle,\\\" \\\"At College,\\\", \\\"Down East,\\\" and then by \\\"In the Air,\\\" where we last met them.\"\n        ],\n

The hawk darted at him fiercely, and pecked at him, to draw his attention from her, and he stepped back, yet he continued, taking fatal draughts from the magic cup of her beauty.  Then the hawk, screamed a loud scream of anguish, and the Princess awoke, and started, half-way from the couch, and stared about her, and saw the bird in, agitation.  As she looked at the bird a shudder passed over her, and she, snatched a veil and drew it over her face, murmuring, 'I dream, or I am, under the eye of a man.'  Then she felt beneath the pillow, and knew that, the cockle-shell had been touched; and in a moment she leapt from her, couch, and ran to a mirror and saw herself as she was, a full-moon made, to snare the wariest and sit singly high on a throne in the hearts of, men.  At the sight of her beauty she smiled and seemed at peace\\n\\nThen said Shibli Bagarag, 'For this I praise Noorna bin Noorka, daughter, of Feshnavat, Vizier of the King that ruleth in the city of Shagpat!  She, saw me, that I was marked for greatness.  Wullahy, the eagle knoweth me, from afar, and proclaimeth me; the antelope of the hills scenteth the, coming of one not as other men, and telleth his tidings; the wind of the, desert shapeth its gust to a meaning, so that the stranger may wot Shibli, Bagarag is at hand!'\\n\\nThen he thought, ''Twere nevertheless well to do as the fountain, directeth, and question men while I see them.'  And he walked about among, the people, and came to the quays of the harbour where the ships lay, close in, many of them an easy leap from shore, and considered whom to, address.  So, as he loitered about the quays, meditating on the means at, the disposal of the All-Wise, and marking the vessels wistfully, behold\\n\\nThe Ass sniffed, turning to the four quarters, and chose a certain, direction, and bore them swiftly over hills and streans eddying in, silver; over huge mounds of sand, where the tents of Bedouins stood in, white clusters; over lakes smooth as the cheeks of sleeping loveliness;, by walls of cities, mosques, and palaces; under towers that rose as an, armed man with the steel on his brows and the frown of battle; by the, shores of the pale foaming sea it bore them, going at a pace that the, Arab on his steed outstrippeth not.  So when the sun was red and the dews, were blushing with new light, they struggled from a wilderness of barren, broken ground, and saw beneath them, in the warm beams, green, peaceful\\n\\nand lo! there was the Genie by a well under a palm, and he standing in, the shape of an Ass, saddled.  So they mounted him, and in a moment they, were in the midst of the desert, and naught round them save the hot, glimmer of the sands and the grey of the sky.  Surely, the Ass went at, such a pace as never Ass went before in this world, resting not by the, rivulets, nor under the palms, nor beside the date-boughs; it was as if, the Ass scurried without motion of his legs, so swiftly went he.  At last, the desert gave signs of a border on the low line of the distance, and, this grew rapidly higher as they advanced, revealing a country of hills, and rocks, and at the base of these the Ass rested.\\n\\nThen he yelled a glad yell, and stooped to Shibli Bagarag on the horse, and enveloped him, and seized him, and plucked him from the Horse, and, whirled him round, and flung him off.  The youth went circling in the, air, high in it, and descended, circling, at a distance in the deep, meadow-waters.  When he crept up the banks he saw the Genie astride the, Horse Garraveen, with a black flame round his head; and the Genie urged, him to speed and put him to the gallop, and was soon lost to sight, as he, had been a thunderbeam passing over a still lake at midnight.  And Shibli, Bagarag was smitten with the wrong and the folly of his act, and sought, to hide his sight from Noorna; but she called to him, 'Look up, O youth!, and face the calamity.  Lo, we have now lost the service of Karaz! for, though I utter ten spells and one spell in a breath, the Horse Garraveen, will ere that have stretched beyond the circle of my magic, and the Genie, will be free to do his ill deeds and plot against us.  Sad is it! but, profit thou by a knowledge of thy weakness.'\\n\\nThey relate that Shahpesh, the Persian, commanded the building of a, palace, and Khipil was his builder.  The work lingered from the first, year of the reign of Shahpesh even to his fourth.  One day Shahpesh went, to the riverside where it stood, to inspect it.  Khipil was sitting on a, marble slab among the stones and blocks; round him stretched lazily the, masons and stonecutters and slaves of burden; and they with the curve of, humorous enjoyment on their lips, for he was reciting to them adventures\\n\\nHe climbed the sides of the mountain, and was soon hidden in the clefts, and beyond the perches of the vulture.  She kept her eyes on the rocky, point when he disappeared, awaiting his return; and the sun went over her, head and sank on the yon-side of the mountain, and it was by the beams of, the moon that she beheld Shibli Bagarag dropping from the crags and, ledges of rock, sliding and steadying himself downward till he reached, her with the phial in his hand, filled; and he was radiant, as it were, divine with freshness, so that Noorna, before she spoke welcome to him\\n\\nAnd he cried, 'O King of the age, the barber is abased, trodden, underfoot, given over to the sneers and the gibes of them that flatter, the powerful ones; he is as the winter worm, as the crocodile in the, slime of his sleep by the bank, as the sick eagle before moulting.  But I, say, O King, that he will come forth like the serpent in a new skin\\n\\nThen said she, 'O Shibli Bagarag, 'tis achieved, this first of thy tasks;, for mutely on the fresh red of thy mouth, my betrothed, speaketh the, honey of persuasiveness, and the children of Aklis will not resist thee.', So she took the phial from him and led forth the Ass, and the twain, mounted the Ass and descended the slopes of the mountain in moonlight;, and Shibli Bagarag said, 'Lo! I have marked wonders, and lived a life, since our parting; and this well, 'tis a miracle to dip in it, and by it, sit many maidens weeping and old men babbling, and youths that were idle, youths striking bubbles from the surface of the water.  The well is, rounded with marble, and the sky is clear in it, cool in it, the whole, earth imaged therein.'\\n\\nand entered its circle, and that the two stars seemed mixing the, splendour that was theirs.  Now, that sight amazed me, and my heart in, its beating quickened with the expectation of things approaching.  Surely, I rendered praise, and pressed both hands on my bosom, and watched, and, behold! the comet, the illumined tadpole, was becoming restless beneath, the joint rays of the twain that were dominating him; and he diminished\\n\\narrowy, lance-like, like leaning sheaves, and crouching baboons, and, kicking jackasses, and cocks a-crow, and lutes slack-strung; and she, knelt and mumbled over and over words of magic, like the drone of a bee, to hear, and as a roll of water, nothing distinguishable.  After that she, sought for an unguent of a red colour, and smeared it on a part of the, floor by the corner of the room, and wrote on it in silver fluid a word, that was the word 'Eblis,' and over that likewise she droned awhile., Presently she arose with a white-heated face, the sweat on her brow, and, said to Shibli Bagarag and Feshnavat hurriedly and in a harsh tone, 'How?, have ye fear?'\\n\\nand the bones of travellers whiten in loneliness; and they continued, mounting upward by winding paths, now closed in by coverts, now upon open, heights having great views, and presently a mountain was disclosed to, them, green at the sides high up it; and Noorna bin Noorka said to Shibli, Bagarag, 'Mount here, for the cunning of this Ass can furnish him no, excuse further for making thee food for the birds of prey.'\\n\\nAnd Noorna said, 'Not only an entire city, but other cities affected by, him, as witness Oolb, whither thou wilt go; and there be governments and, states, and conditions of men remote, that hang upon him, Shagpat.  'Tis, even so; I swell not his size.  When thou hast mastered the Event, and, sent him forth shivering from thy blade like the shorn lamb, 'twill be, known how great a thing has been achieved, and a record for the, generations to come; choice is that historian destined to record it!'\\n\\nand settled on his head, and coated part of his body.  So when this, tadpole, that was once terrible to me, became turbaned, shoed, and, shawled with darkness, and there was little of him remaining visible, lo!, a concluding flash shot from thy star, and he fell heavily down the sky, and below the hills, into the sea, that is the Enchanted Sea, whose Queen, is Rabesqurat, Mistress of Illusions.  Now when my soul recovered from, amazement at the marvels seen, I arose and went from the starry roofs to, consult my books of magic, and 'twas revealed to me that one was, wandering to a junction with my destiny, and that by his means the great, aim would of a surety be accomplished--Shagpat Shaved!  So my purpose was, to discover him; and I made calculations, and summoned them that serve me, to search for such a youth as thou art; fairly, O my betrothed, did I, preconceive thee.  And so it was that I traced a magic line from the, sand-hills to the city, and from the outer hills to the sand-hills; and, whoso approached by that line I knew was he marked out as my champion, my, betrothed,--a youth destined for great things.  Was I right?  The egg, hatcheth.  Thou art already proved by thwackings, seasoned to the, undertaking, and I doubt not thou art he that will finish with that, tadpole Shagpat, and sit in the high seat, thy name an odour in distant, lands, a joy to the historian, the Compiler of Events, thou Master of the, Event, the greatest which time will witness for ages to come.'\\n\\nNow, the extent of the duration of his travel was four days and an equal, number of nights; and it was on the fifth morn that he entered the gates, of a city by the sea, even at that hour when the inhabitants were rising, from sleep: fair was the sea beyond it, and the harbour was crowded with, vessels, ships stored with merchandise--silks, dates, diamonds, Damascus, steel, huge bales piled on the decks for the land of Roum and other, lands.  Shibli Bagarag thought, 'There's scarce a doubt but that one of, those sails will set for Oolb shortly.  Wullahy! if I knew which, I'd, board her and win a berth in her.'  Presently he thought, 'I'll go to the, public fountain and question it with the speech-winning waters.', Thereupon he passed down the streets of the city and came to an open, space, where stood the fountain, and sprinkled it with Paravid; and the, fountain spake, saying, 'Where men are, question not dumb things.'\\n\\nmy betrothed! speak not of him in that fashion, 'tis dangerous; and my, power cannot keep off his emissaries at all times.'  Then she said, 'O my, betrothed, know me a sorceress ensorcelled; not that I seem, but that I, shall be!  Wait thou for the time and it will reward thee.  What! thou, think'st to have plucked a wrinkled o'erripe fruit,--a mouldy pomegranate, under the branches, a sour tamarind?  'Tis well!  I say nought, save that, time will come, and be thou content.  It is truly as I said, that I have, thee between me and Shagpat; and that honoured one of this city thought, fit in his presumption to demand me in marriage at the hands of my, father, knowing me wise, and knowing the thing that transformed me to, this, the abominable fellow!  Surely my father entertained not his, proposal save with scorn; but the King looked favourably on it, and it is, even now matter of reproach to Feshnavat, my father, that he withholdeth, me from Shagpat.'\\n\\nAnd the King swore by the beard of his father he would seize perforce the, hawk and shut up Shibli Bagarag in the vault, if he fell not into his, bargain.  Shibli Bagarag was advised by the hawk to accept the China jar, and the dress of Samarcand, and handed the hawk to the King in exchange, for these things.  So the King took the hawk upon his wrist and departed, with it to the apartments of his daughter, and Shibli Bagarag went to the, chamber prepared for him in the palace.\\n\\nHe promised her, and they lay and slept.  When he awoke the sun was half-, risen, and he looked at Noorna bin Noorka in the silken bag, and she was, yet in the peacefulness of pleasant dreams; but for the Ass, surely his, eyes rolled, and his head and fore legs were endued with life, while his, latter half seemed of stone.  And the youth called to Noorna bin Noorka\\n\\nYet put the case, that my kisses--I shower them not, Allah the All-seeing, is my witness! and they be given daintily as 'twere to the leaf of a, nettle, or over-hot pilau.  Yet haply kisses repeated might restore her, to a bloom, and it is certain youth is somehow stolen from her, if the, Vizier Feshnavat went before her, and his blood be her blood; and he is, powerful, she wise.  I'll decide to act the part of a rejoicer\\n\\nWhen she had spoken Shibli Bagarag considered her words, and the, knowledge that he was selected by destiny as Master of the Event inflated, him; and he was a hawk in eagerness, a peacock in pride, an ostrich in, fulness of chest, crying, 'O Noorna bin Noorka! is't really so?  Truly it, must be, for the readers of planets were also busy with me at the time of, my birth, interpreting of me in excessive agitation; and the thing they, foretold is as thou foretellest.  I am, wullahy! marked: I walk manifest, in the eye of Providence.'\\n\\nand beheld the shadows of the moon thrown forward into dimness across a, waste of sand.  And he stepped downward to the level of sand, and went, the way of the shadows till it was dawn.  Then dropped he a drop of the, waters of the phial on a spike of lavender, and there was a voice said to, him in reply to what he questioned, 'The path of the shadows of the sun.'\\n\\nThen the hawk whispered to Shibli Bagarag, 'Forward and shear him!'  So, he stepped forth and seized the tackle, and addressed himself keenly to, the shaving of the King of Oolb, lathering him and performing his task, with perfect skill.  And the courtiers crowded to follow the example of, the King, and Shibli Bagarag shaved them, all of them.  Now, when they, were shaved, fear smote them, the fear of ridicule, and each laughed at, the change that was in the other; but the King cried, 'See that order is, issued for the people of Oolb to be as we before to-morrow's sun.  So is, laughter taken in reverse.'  And the King said aside to Shibli Bagarag\\n\\nThen he said, 'All this while have ye talked, and no deliberation as to, that!  Lo, I have drawn the Cadi to our plot, and bribed him with a, mighty bribe; and I have prepared possible disguises for this nephew of, the barber; and I have had the witnesses of thy betrothal despatched to, foreign parts, far kingdoms in the land of Roum, to prevent tattling and, gabbling; and ye that were left alone for debating as to the great deed\\n\\nmurmuring still, 'I am under the eye of a man, or I dream.'  Now, while, she so murmured she arrayed herself, and took the cockle-shell, and, passed through the ante-room among her women sleeping; and Shibli Bagarag, tracked her till she came to the vault; and she entered it and walked to, the corner from which had hung the dress of Samarcand.  When she saw it, gone her face waxed pale, and she gazed slowly at all points, muttering\\n\\nSo the Vizier replied, 'He hath had thwackings, yet is he not deterred, from making further attempt on Shagpat.  I think well of him, and I augur, hopefully.  Wullahy! the Cadi shall be sent for; I can sleep in his, secresy; and he shall perform the ceremonies of betrothal, even now and, where we sit, and it shall be for him to write the terms of contract: so, shall we bind the youth firmly to us, and he will be one of us as we are\\n\\nSo the Vizier put that interrogation to Shibli Bagarag, and the youth was, in perplexity; thinking, 'Is it possible to be joyful in the embrace of, one that hath brought thwackings upon us, serious blows?'  Thinking, 'Yet, hath she, when the mood cometh, kindly looks; and I marked her eye, dwelling on me admiringly!' And he thought, 'Mayhap she that groweth, younger and counteth nature backwards, hath a history that would affect, me; or, it may be, my kisses--wah!  I like not to give them, and it is, said\\n\\nKhipil abased himself before Shahpesh, and answered, ''Tis even here, O, King of the age, where thou delightest the earth with thy foot and the, ear of thy slave with sweetness.  Surely a site of vantage, one that, dominateth earth, air, and water, which is the builder's first and chief, requisition for a noble palace, a palace to fill foreign kings and, sultans with the distraction of envy; and it is, O Sovereign of the time\\n\\nSo she said, 'Go!' and Shibli Bagarag showed her the breadth of his, shoulders, and stepped briskly toward the meadows, and was soon brushing, among the flowers and soft mosses of the meadows, lifting his nostrils to, the joyful smells, looking about him with the broad eye of one that, hungereth for a coming thing.  The birds went up above him, and the trees, shook and sparkled, and the waters of brooks and broad rivers flashed, like waving mirrors waved by the slave-girls in sport when the beauties, of the harem riot and dip their gleaming shoulders in the bath.  He, wandered on, lost in the gladness that lived, till the loud neigh of a, steed startled him, and by the banks of a river before him he beheld the, Horse Garraveen stooping to drink of the river; glorious was the look of, the creature,--silver-hoofed, fashioned in the curves of beauty and, swiftness.  So Shibli Bagarag put up his two hands and blew the call of, battle, and the Horse Garraveen arched his neck at the call, and swung, upon his haunches, and sought the call, answering it, and tossing his, mane as he advanced swiftly.  Then, as he neared, Shibli Bagarag held the, musk-ball in his fingers, and aimed at the fetlock of the, Horse Garraveen, and flung it, and struck him so that he stumbled and, fell.  He snorted fiercely as he bent to the grass, but Shibli Bagarag, ran to him, and grasped strongly the tuft of hair hanging forward between, his ears, and traced between his fine eyes a figure of the crescent with, his forenail, and the Horse ceased plunging, and was gentle as a colt by, its mother's side, and suffered Shibli Bagarag to bestride him, and spurn, him with his heel to speed, and bore him fleetly across the fair length, of the golden meadows to where Noorna bin Noorka sat awaiting him.  She, uttered a cry of welcome, saying, 'This is achieved with diligence and, skill, O my betrothed! and on thy right wrist I mark strength like a, sleeping leopard, and the children of Aklis will not resist thee.'\\n\\nNow, when he awoke he found himself alone in that place, the moon shining, over the low meadows and flower-cups fair with night-dew.  Odours of, night-flowers were abroad, filling the cool air with deliciousness, and, he heard in the gardens below songs of the bulbul: it was like a dream to, his soul, and he lay somewhile contemplating the rich loveliness of the, scene, that showed no moving thing.  Then rose he and bethought him of, the words of Noorna, and of the City of Oolb, and the phial of the waters, of Paravid in his vest; and he drew it forth, and dropped a drop of it on, the rock where he had reclined.  A deep harmony seemed suddenly to awake, inside the rock, and to his interrogation as to the direction of Oolb, he, heard, 'The path of the shadows of the moon.'\\n\\nQuoth he, looking eagerly at her, 'O Noorna, what is it in thy speech, affecteth me?  Surely it infuseth the vigour of wine, old wine; and I, shiver with desire to shave Shagpat, and spin threads for the historian, to weave in order.  I, wullahy! had but dry visions of the greatness, destined for me till now, my betrothed!  Shall I master an Event in, shaving him, and be told of to future ages?  By Allah and his Prophet, (praise be to that name!), this is greatness!  Say, Noorna, hadst thou, foreknowledge of me and my coming to this city?'\\n\\nthere was a deep growl of thunder, and the palace rocked, tottering; and, the air became smoky and full of curling vapours.  Presently they were, aware of the cry of a Cat, and its miaulings; and the patch of red, unguent on the floor parted and they beheld a tawny Cat with an arched, back.  So Noorna bin Noorka frowned fiercely at the Cat, and cried, 'This, is thy shape, O Karaz; change! for it serves not the purpose.'\\n\\nThe King then left him with a guard of twenty-five of his body-guard; and, they stood around him with bent bows, so that Khipil dared not move from, his sitting posture.  And the masons and the people crowded to see Khipil, sitting on his master's chair, for it became rumoured about.  When they, beheld him sitting upon nothing, and he trembling to stir for fear of the, loosening of the arrows, they laughed so that they rolled upon the floor, of the hall, and the echoes of laughter were a thousand-fold.  Surely the, arrows of the guards swayed with the laughter that shook them.\\n\\nand again another and another, rapidly, pertinaciously.  And from thy, star there passed repeated flashes across the head of the tadpole, till, his brilliance was as 'twere severed from him, and he, like drossy, silver, a dead shape in the conspicuous heavens.  And he became yellow as, the rolling eyes of sick wretches in pain, and shrank in his place like, pale parchment at the touch of flame; dull was he as an animal fascinated, by fear, and deprived of all power to make head against the foe\\n\\nThen Shahpesh laughed, and cried, 'Chafe not! it is an ill thing and a, hideous!  This nosegay, O Khipil, it is for thee to present to thy, mistress.  Truly she will receive thee well after its presentation!  I, will have it now sent in thy name, with word that thou followest quickly., And for thy nettled nose, surely if the whim seize thee that thou, desirest its chafing, to thy neighbour is permitted what to thy hand is, refused.'\\n\\nKhipil yet hesitated, for the gap was of many strides, and at the bottom, of the gap was a deep water, and he one that knew not the motion of, swimming.  But Shahpesh ordered his guard to point their arrows in the, direction of Khipil, and Khipil stepped forward hurriedly, and fell in, the gap, and was swallowed by the water below.  When he rose the second, time, succour reached him, and he was drawn to land trembling, his teeth, chattering.  And Shahpesh praised him, and said, 'This is an apt, contrivance for a bath, Khipil O my builder! well conceived; one that, taketh by surprise; and it shall be thy reward daily when much talking, hath fatigued thee.'\\n\\nThen she said to the Vizier Feshnavat, 'O my father, there is all in this, youth, the nephew of the barber, that's desirable for the undertaking;, and his feet will be on a level with the task we propose for him, he the, height of man above it.  'Tis clear that vanity will trip him, but, honesty is a strong upholder; and he is one that hath the spirit of, enterprise and the mask of dissimulation: gratitude I observe in him; and, it is as I thought when I came upon him on the sand-hill outside the, city, that his star is clearly in a web with our star, he destined for, the Shaving of Shagpat.'\\n\\nNow, when it was night, Shibli Bagarag heard a noise at his lattice, and, he arose and peered through it, and lo! the hawk was fluttering without;, so he let it in, and caressed it, and the hawk bade him put on his silken, dress and carry forth his China jar, and go the round of the palace, and, offer drink to the sentinels and the slaves.  So he did as the hawk, directed, and the sentinels and slaves were aware of a China jar brimmed, with wine that was lifted to their lips, but him that lifted it they saw, not: surely, they drank deep of the draught of astonishment.\\n\\nwhen suddenly, lo! a star from the upper heaven that shot down between, them wildly, and my star took lustre from it; and the star of Shagpat, trembled like a ring on a tightened rope, and waved and flickered, and, seemed to come forward and to retire; and 'twas presently as a comet in, the sky, bright,--a tadpole, with large head and lengthy tail, in the, assembly of the planets.  This I saw: and that the stranger star was, stationed by my star, shielding it, and that it drew nearer to my star\\n\\nSo Shibli Bagarag mounted, and they ceased not to ascend the green slopes, till the grass became scanty and darkness fell, and they were in a region, of snow and cold.  Then Noorna bin Noorka tethered the Ass to a stump of, a tree and breathed in his ear, and the Ass became as a creature carved, in stone; and she drew from her bosom two bags of silk, and blew in one, and entered it, bidding Shibli Bagarag do likewise with the other bag;, and he obeyed her, drawing it up to his neck, and the delightfulness of, warmth came over him.  Then said she, 'To-morrow, at noon, we shall reach, near the summit of the mountain and the Well of Paravid, if my power last, over this Ass; and from that time thou wilt be on the high road to, greatness, so fail not to remember what I have done for thee, and be not, guilty of ingratitude when thy hand is the stronger.'\\n\\nSo she said, ''Tis in Aklis, in the mountains of the Koosh; and the seven, sons of Aklis sharpen it day and night till the adventurer cometh to, claim it for his occasion.  Whoso succeedeth in coming to them they know, to have power over the sword, and 'tis then holiday for them.  Many are, the impediments, and they are as holes where the fox haunteth.  So they, deliver to his hand the sword till his object is attained, his Event, mastered, smitten through with it; and 'tis called the Sword of Events., Surely, with it the father of the Seven vanquished the mighty Roc\\n\\nand they were soon in the hollows of deep waters.  There was a berth in, the ship set apart for Shibli Bagarag, and one for the captain.  Shibli, Bagarag, when he entered his berth, beheld at the head of his couch a, hawk; its eyes red as rubies, its beak sharp as the curve of a scimitar., So he called out to the captain, and the captain came to him; but when he, saw the hawk, he plucked his turban from his head, and dashed it at the, hawk, and afterward ran to it, trying to catch it; and the hawk flitted, from corner to corner of the berth, he after it with open arms.  Then he, took a sword, but the hawk flew past him, and fixed on the back part of, his head, tearing up his hair by the talons, and pecking over his, forehead at his eyes.  And Shibli Bagarag heard the hawk scream the name, 'Karaz,' and he looked closely at the Captain of the vessel, and knew him, for the Genie Karaz.  Then trembled he with exceeding terror, cursing his, credulities, for he saw himself in the hands of the Genie, and nothing, but this hawk friendly to him on the fearful waters.  When the hawk had, torn up a certain hair, the Genie stiffened, and glowed like copper in, the furnace, the whole length of him; and he descended heavily through, the bottom of the ship, and sank into the waters beneath, which hissed, and smoked as at a bar of heated iron.  Then Shibli Bagarag gave thanks, to the Prophet, and praised the hawk, but the hawk darted out of the, cabin, and he followed it on deck, and, lo!  the vessel was in flames\\n\\nThen the hawk whispered in his ear, 'Drop on the tackle secretly a drop, from the phial.'  This he did, spreading his garments, and commanded the, tackle to speak.  And the tackle spake, each portion of it, confusedly as, the noise of Babel.  So the King marvelled greatly, and said, ''Tis a, greater wonder than the talking hawk, the talking tackle.  Wullahy! it, ennobleth barbercraft!  Yet it were well to comprehend the saying of the, tackle.'\\n\\nNow, so it was that the Vizier despatched a summons for the attendance of, the Cadi, and he carne and performed between Shibli Bagarag and Noorna, bin Noorka ceremonies of betrothal, and wrote terms of contract; and they, were witnessed duly by the legal number of witnesses, and so worded that, he had no claim on her as wife till such time as the Event to which he, bound himself was mastered.  Then the fees being paid, and compliments, interchanged, the Vizier exclaimed, 'Be ye happy! and let the weak cling, to the strong; and be ye two to one in this world, and no split halves, that betray division and stick not together when the gum is heated.', Then he made a sign to the Cadi and them that had witnessed the contract, to follow him, leaving the betrothed ones to their own company.\\n\\nNoorna bin Noorka continued, 'Thou knowest, O my father, I am proficient, in the arts of magic, and I am what I am, and what I shall be, by its, uses.  'Tis known to thee also that I hold a Genie in bondage, and can, utter ten spells and one spell in a breath.  Surely my services to the, youth in his attainment of the Sword will be beyond price!  Now to reach, Aklis and the Sword there are three things needed--charms: and one is a, phial full of the waters of Paravid from the wells in the mountain yon-, side the desert; and one, certain hairs that grow in the tail of the, horse Garraveen, he that roameth wild in the meadows of Melistan; and, one, that the youth gather and bear to Aklis, for the white antelope, Gulrevaz, the Lily of the Lovely Light that groweth in the hollow of the, crags over the Enchanted Sea: with these spells he will command the Sword, of Aklis, and nothing can bar him passage.  Moreover I will expend in his, aid all my subtleties, my transformations, the stores of my wisdom.  Many, seek this Sword, and people the realms of Rabesqurat, or are beasts in, Aklis, or crowned Apes, or go to feed the Roc, Kroojis, in the abyss, beneath the Roc's-egg bridge; but there's virtue in Shibli Bagarag:, wullahy!  I am wistful in him of the hand of Destiny, and he will succeed, in this undertaking if he dareth it.'\\n\\nShe jeered him as they journeyed, and made the soul of Shibli Bagarag, merry, so that he jerked in his seat upon the Ass.  Now, as they ascended, the mountain they came to the opening of a cavern, and Noorna bin Noorka, halted the Ass, and said to Shibli Bagarag, 'We part here, and I wait for, thee in this place.  Take this phial, and fill it with the waters of the, well, after thy bath.  The way is before thee--speed on it.'\\n\\nThen, after they had gazed awhile, Noorna bin Noorka said, 'In these, meadows the Horse Garraveen roameth at will.  Heroes of bliss bestride, him on great days.  He is black to look on; speed quivers in his flanks, like the lightning; his nostrils are wide with flame; there is that in, his eye which is settled fire, and that in his hoofs which is ready, thunder; when he paws the earth kingdoms quake: no animal liveth with, blood like the Horse Garraveen.  He is under a curse, for that he bore on, his back one who defied the Prophet.  Now, to make him come to thee thou, must blow the call of battle, and to catch him thou must contrive to, strike him on the fetlock as he runs with this musk-ball which I give, thee; and to tame him thou must trace between his eyes a figure or the, crescent with thy forenail.  When that is done, bring him to me here\\n\\nNow, at her words the whole Genie became as live coal with anger, and he, panted black and bright, and made a stride toward Shibli Bagarag, and, stretched his arm out to seize him; but Noorna, blew quickly on the, circles she had drawn, and the circles rose up in a white flame high as, the heads of those present, and the Genie shrank hastily back from the, flame, and was seized with fits of sneezing.  Then she said in scorn\\n\\nNow, the King ceased not persecuting Khipil, under pretence of doing him, honour and heaping favours on him.  Three days and three nights was, Khipil gasping without water, compelled to drink of the drought of the, fountain, as an honour at the hands of the King.  And he was seven days, and seven nights made to stand with, stretched arms, as they were the branches of a tree, in each hand a, pomegranate.  And Shahpesh brought the people of his court to regard the, wondrous pomegranate shoot planted by Khipil, very wondrous, and a new, sort, worthy the gardens of a King.  So the wisdom of the King was, applauded, and men wotted he knew how to punish offences in coin, by the, punishment inflicted on Khipil the builder.  Before that time his affairs, had languished, and the currents of business instead of flowing had, become stagnant pools.  It was the fashion to do as did Khipil, and fancy, the tongue a constructor rather than a commentator; and there is a doom, upon that people and that man which runneth to seed in gabble, as the, poet says in his wisdom:\\n\\nHe answered, 'Surely all was made smooth for me by thy aid.  Now when I, came to the well I marked not them by it, but plunged, and the depth of, that well seemed to me the very depth of the earth itself, so went I ever, downward; and when I was near the bottom of the well I had forgotten life, above, and lo! no sooner had I touched the bottom of the well when my, head emerged from the surface: 'twas wondrous!  But for a sign that, touched the bottom of the well, see, O Noorna bin Noorka, the Jewel, the, one of myriads that glitter at the bottom, and I plucked it for a gift to, thee.'\\n\\nHe conducted Shahpesh among the unfinished saloons and imperfect courts, and roofless rooms, and by half erected obelisks, and columns pierced and, chipped, of the palace of his building.  And he was bewildered at the, words spoken by Shahpesh; but now the King exalted him, and admired the, perfection of his craft, the greatness of his labour, the speediness of, his construction, his assiduity; feigning not to behold his negligence.\\n\\nand left it no outlet.  Now, as Shibli Bagarag watched the hawk, the, flames stretched out towards him and took hold of his vestments.  So he, delayed not to commend his soul to the All-merciful, and bore witness to, his faith, and plunged into the sea headlong.  When he rose, the ship had, vanished, and all was darkness where it had been; so he buffeted with the, billows, thinking his last hour had come, and there was no help for him, in this world; and the spray shaken from the billows blinded him, the, great walls of water crumbled over him; strength failed him, and his, memory ceased to picture images of the old time--his heart to beat with, ambition; and to keep the weight of his head above the surface was, becoming a thing worth the ransom of kings.  As he was sinking and, turning his eyes upward, he heard a flutter as of fledgling's wings, and, the two red ruby eyes of the hawk were visible above him, like steady, fires in the gloom.  And the hawk perched on him, and buried itself among, the wet hairs of his head, and presently taking the Identical in its, beak, the hawk lifted him half out of water, and bore him a distance, and, dropped him.  This the hawk did many times, and at the last, Shibli, Bagarag felt land beneath him, and could wade through the surges to the, shore.  He gave thanks to the Supreme Disposer, kneeling prostrate on the, shore, and fell into a sleep deep in peacefulness as a fathomless well\\n\\nand pointed to her the strangeness of the condition of the Ass.  As she, cast eyes on him she cried out, and rushed to him, and took him by the, ears and blew up his nostrils, and the animal was quiet.  Then she and, Shibli Bagarag mounted him again, and she said to him, 'It is well thou, wert more vigilant than I, and that the sun rose not on this Ass while I, slept, or my enchantment would have thawed on him, and he would have, 'scaped us.'\\n\\n'There is no further doubt but that I am under the eye of a man!', Thereupon she ran hastily from the vault, and passed between the, sentinels of the palace, and saw them where they lay drowsy with, intoxication: so she knew that the China jar and the dress of Samarcand, had been used that night, and for no purpose friendly to her wishes., Then she passed down the palace steps, and through the gates of the, palace and the city, till she came to the shore of the sea; there she, launched the cockle-shell and took the wind in her garments, and sat in, it, filling it to overflowing, yet it floated.  And Shibli Bagarag waded, to the cockle-shell and took hold of it, and was drawn along by its, motion swiftly through the waters, so that a foam swept after him; and, Goorelka marked the foam.  Now, they had passage over the billows, smoothly, and soon the length of the sea was darkened with two high, rocks, and between them there was a narrow channel of the sea, roughened, with moonlight.  So they sped between the rocks, and came upon a purple, sea, dark-blue overhead, with large stars leaning to the waves.  There, was a soft whisperingness in the breath of the breezes that swung there\\n\\nThe hawk flapped its wings and winked both eyes; so Shibli Bagarag took, forth the phial from his breast, remembering the virtues of the waters of, the Well of Paravid, and touched his lips with them, that he might be, endowed with flowing speech before the King of Oolb.  As he did this the, phial was open, and the hawk leaned to it and dipped its beak into the, water; and he entered the city and passed through the long streets, towards the palace of the King, and craved audience of him as one that, had a thing marvellous to tell.  So the King commanded that Shibli, Bagarag should be brought before him, for he was a lover of marvels.  As, he went into the presence of the King, Shibli Bagarag listened to the, hawk, for the hawk spake his language, and it said, 'Proclaim to the King, a new wonder--\\\"the talking hawk.\\\"'\\n\\nKhipil plucked a handful of the nettles that were there in the place of, flowers, and put his nose to them before Shahpesh, till his nose was, reddened; and desire to rub it waxed in him, and possessed him, and, became a passion, so that he could scarce refrain from rubbing it even in, the King's presence.  And the King encouraged him to sniff and enjoy, their fragrance, repeating the poet's words:\",\n          \"The dream was over--the blessed dream of philanthropy and reform! The, reins of power had been snatched from his hands, and Joseph was once, more consigned to a life of insignificant inactivity. Like a wounded, bird, whose broken wing no longer bears him aloft his heart fluttered, and fell--its high hopes dashed to earth. The old influences which he, hated, were at work again, and he had no recourse but absolute silence., His deep humiliation, he was constrained to hide under a mask of, serenity; but he knew that his spirit was crushed, and night fell over, his stricken soul. Still, he struggled against the chill of his despair\\n\\nand sting the pride of our nationality. With their tyrannical commercial, edicts, they have dealt injury to friends as well as foes. The closing, of the Scheldt and Rhine, the Barrier treaty, and all the other, restrictions upon trade devised by those crafty English to damage the, traffic of other nations, all these compacts have been made as binding, upon Austria as upon every other European power. Unmindful of their, alliance with us, the maritime powers have closed their ports against, our ships; and while affecting to watch the Netherlands in our behalf\\n\\n\\\"Complain if you choose, it is indifferent to me,\\\" cried Joseph, with a, hoarse laugh. \\\"Never in this world shall you be my wife. If the hateful, tie that binds me to you cannot be unloosed, I will make you answerable, for every day of disgust and misery that I am forced to pass under the, same roof with you. If I am cursed before the world with the name of, your husband. I shall punish you in secret with my everlasting hate.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor with his two companions walked toward the village. Nothing, very hopeful was to be seen as they looked up the dirty little streets., The wretched mud cottages stood each one apart, their yards separated by, scraggy willow-hedges, upon which ragged old garments were hanging in, the sun to dry. Between the hedges were muddy pools, over which the, ducks were wrangling for the bits of weed that floated on the surface of, the foul waters. On their borders, in the very midst of the rubbish and, kitchen offal that lay about in heaps, dirty, half-naked children, with, straw-colored hair, tumbled over one another, or paddled in the water., In the farm-yards around the dung-heaps, the youngest children of the, cottagers kept company with the sow and her grunting pigs. Before the, slovenly entrances of the huts here and there sat dirty, unseemly old, men and women, who stared at the three strangers as they surveyed the, uninviting picture before them.\\n\\n\\\"Peace, Binder, my story is not yet ended. One morning the dog and the, cat were found dead in THEIR corner; and in the other, the fox lay, bleeding and moaning; while of the hen, nothing remained save her, feathers. Time--the despot that rules us all, had outwitted the keeper, and asserted the laws of Nature. The cat's claws had grown out, and so, had the dog's teeth. The fox, after much pondering over his misfortunes\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" said he, after a long and painful pause, \\\"not a word of thanks!, Joy has made you dumb, I perceive. And no wonder; for to feel (for the, first time) the pleasures of benevolence may well make you speechless, with happiness. As for you, madame,\\\" continued the emperor, addressing, his hostess, \\\"I will not deprive you of a share in your husband's, generosity. You will be so kind as to call up your servants and bid them, load a wagon with the remains of our excellent dinner, not forgetting, the wines; and you will then send it, with your greetings, to your, tenants in yonder village. Your servants can go from house to house, until the store is exhausted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hear the coward!\\\" cried Gluck vehemently; \\\"see the woman's nature, shrinking from the path of honor because it is beset with danger. I did, well not to let you know the nature of my last labors, for with your, sighs and croakings you would have turned me back again into the highway, of falsehood. But you are too late, poltroon. The work is done, and it, shall see light.\\\" Gluck looked at his wife's face, and the expression he, saw there made him pause. He was already sorry, and ready to atone. \\\"No\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty,\\\" said she, with an expression of painful anxiety, \\\"I, entreat of you not to revoke that privilege! Believe me when I tell you, that it is dangerous to interfere with customs which are so old that the, people have grown to look upon them as right. Ever since the days of, Francis I the royal family has dined in public, and every decently-clad, person has enjoyed the privilege of entering the banquet-room. Moreover\\n\\nMeanwhile, the young emperor was in his palace. The anterooms were, filled with petitioners of every sort, who, through bribes offered to, the members of the imperial household, had penetrated thus far, and were, now awaiting the appearance of the emperor. The anterooms of Maria, Theresa had always been thronged with these petitioners, and now they, jostled each other without ceremony, each one hoping to be remarked by, the emperor as he passed on to his carriage.\\n\\n\\\"Write; yes. You wrote me to say that you would not consent to be mine, unless I carried you away from Vienna. Then you went on to order our, mode of travelling as you would have done had I been your husband. 'Be, here at such an hour; have your passes for various countries. Describe, me therein as your sister. Come through the garden and await me at the, head of the secret stairway.' Is this a love-letter? It is a mere note, of instructions. For one week I have waited for a look, a sigh, a, pressure of the hand; and when I come hither to take you from your home, forever, you receive me as if I were a courier. No, Margaret, no--I will, not wait to speak my love until we are in Paris.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the second day after the wedding. On the first evening the opera, of \\\"Orpheus and Eurydice\\\" had been triumphantly represented before the, elite of the city. A second representation had been called for by the, delighted audience, although at the imperial palace a magnificent mask, ball was to be given, for which two thousand invitations had been, issued. It was a splendid confusion of lights, jewels, velvet, satins\\n\\nOne hour later the emperor returned from the hotel of his prime, minister, and entered the imperial chapel. He was in full dress, decked, with all his orders. It was only on state occasions that Joseph appeared, in his magnificent uniform; he had not worn it since the marriage of his, nephew to the Princess Elizabeth of Wurtemberg. But his face was very, pale, and when he perceived the bride, he leaned for one moment against, a friendly pillar that saved him from reeling. This weakness, however\\n\\n\\\"They will return to their homes,\\\" said the queen, slightly raising her, shoulders, \\\"and when they reflect coolly on the subject, they will, certainly not think less of me because I prefer to dine like the rest of, the world. I believe that if we desire popularity with the people, we, must show them that we have feeling hearts like themselves, and it is by, such means that I hope to gain the love of the French nation.\\\"\\n\\nLouis looked searchingly at the face of his young wife. \\\"He died of a, malady whose name is an impeachment of the honor of those who survive, him,\\\" said the dauphin, sternly, \\\"and my mother died of the same, disease. [Footnote: It was generally believed that the dauphin and his, wife were poisoned by a political party, whose leader was the Duke de, Choiseul. The royal couple belonged to the anti-Austrian party., \\\"Memoires de Campan,\\\" vol. i., p. 78.] But let us not throw any darker, shadows over the gloom of this heavy hour. I am stifled--I have a, presentiment of--\\\" A loud shout interrupted the dauphin. It came nearer, and nearer, and now it reached the anteroom, where the crowding, courtiers were pouring in to greet King Louis XVI.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty, music has cut off her queue, and really in her new, coiffure she is divinely beautiful. Moreover, your majesty has rewarded, the seventy years of Metastasio with a rich pension, proof enough to him, of the estimation in which his talents are held. Metastasio belongs to, the old regime you have pensioned off; Calzabigi and Gluck are children, of our new Austria. Your majesty's self has created this Austria, and, you owe to her children your imperial countenance and favor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wished to see this asylum of which you had heard, did you not?\\\", asked the queen with a shade of bitterness. \\\"I have been calumniated to, you, as I have been to the king and to the French people. I know how my, enemies are trying to make my subjects hate me! I know that about these, very rooms, lewd songs are sung on the Pont-Neuf which make the Count de, Provence hold his sides with laughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The same. You should have seen the despair of the king. But he was, amiable even in his grief. He tried all sorts of lover's stratagems to, win back the countess; he prowled around her house at night singing like, a Troubadour; be wrote her bushels of letters to implore an interview., All in vain. The liaison with Repnin was made public, and that, of, course, ended the affair. The king was inconsolable. [Footnote: Wraxall\\n\\nHis wife laid her hand upon his arm. \\\"And upon whom falls the light of, day, if not upon you?\\\" asked she, reproachfully. \\\"Look back upon your, twenty operas, and see each one bearing its laurel-wreath, and shouting, to the world your fame! And now look into the future, and see their, unborn sisters, whose lips one day will open to the harmony of your, music, and will teach all nations to love your memory! And I\\n\\nshould preserve them with my regalia at Vienna. All strife and jealousy, between the provinces composing my empire must cease. [Footnote: The, Emperor's own words.--\\\"Letters of Joseph II.\\\"] Provincial interests, must disappear before national exigencies. This is all that I have to, say to the states; but I will say to yourselves, that when I find myself, absolute lord of Hungary, as well as of Austria, I will go thither to be, crowned. And now, Lord Chancellor of Hungary, what other grievance have, you to present?\\\"\\n\\nShe bent over the parchment and wrote; then, throwing her pen on the, floor, she turned to the emperor and pointed with her right hand to the, deed. \\\"Placet,\\\" cried she, with her clear, ringing voice--\\\"placet, since, so many great and wise men will have it so. When I am dead, the world, will learn what came of this violation of all that man holds sacred.\\\", [Footnote: The empress's own words.]\\n\\nWhile the empress, in the full splendor of her rank and beauty, was, representing the sovereign of Austria, the emperor, mingling with the, guests, was taking the liberty of amusing himself as ordinary mortals, love to do at a masked ball. On his arm hung a mask of most graceful, figure, but so completely was she disguised that nothing could be, ascertained with regard to her name or rank. Some whispered that it was, the emperor's new favorite, the Countess of Auersberg.\\n\\n\\\"I know perfectly well the nature of his malady,\\\" thought she. \\\"Whenever, he desires to consult with the emperor before seeing me, he falls sick., Whenever danger is ahead and affairs look stormy he retreats to his hole, like a discreet fox. I wish to Heaven that I too could take to my bed, and shut my eyes to all that is transpiring around us! But no,\\\", continued the empress with a pang of self-reproach, \\\"I have no right to, retire from the post of danger. I must act, and act quickly, or Joseph, will be before me. Oh, my God, help me in my great need.\\\"\\n\\nNever before had any member of the Aulic Council dared to leave that, room until the lord chancellor had given the signal of departure. It was, a case of unparalleled violation of court etiquette. Count Uhlefeld was, aghast, and Bartenstein seemed crushed. Without exchanging a word, the, two friends rose, and with eyes cast down, and faces pale with the, anguish of that hour, together they left the council-chamber toward, which they had repaired with hearts and bearing so triumphant.\\n\\nThe count laughed aloud. \\\"Ah!\\\" cried he, in a harsh, grating voice, \\\"you, think that I might do like Prince Bragation and the Duke of Orleans, who, strangled their young wives because they suspected them of infidelity!, My dear madame, these romantic horrors belong to a bygone century. In, this sober and prosaic age, a nobleman avenges his wounded honor, not by, murder, but by contempt. I have only intruded myself to ask if you are, ready to start?\\\"\\n\\nThe first days of a smiling spring had filled the park with hundreds of, splendid equipages and prancing horsemen. There was the carriage of the, Princess Esterhazy, with twenty outriders in the livery of the prince;, that of the new Prince Palm, whose four black horses wore their harness, of pure gold; there was the gilded fairy, like vis-a-vis of the, beautiful Countess Thun, its panels decorated with paintings from the, hands of one of the first artists of the day; the coach of the Countess, Dietrichstein, drawn by four milk-white horses, whose delicate pasterns, were encircled by jewelled bracelets worthy of glittering upon the arm, of a beauty. In short, the aristocracy of Austria, Hungary, and Lombardy, were there, in all the splendor of their wealth and rank. It seemed as, though Spring were holding a levee, and the nobles of the empire had, thronged her flowery courts.\\n\\n\\\"Rather, your majesty,\\\" said Father Francis, \\\"let us pray Heaven to, soften his heart.\\\" The emperor alone said nothing; but he looked at the, boy with a friendly and sympathizing glance. The child saw the look, and, for one moment a flush of pleasure passed over his face. He raised his, eyes with an appealing expression toward his father, who could no longer, resist the temptation of coming to his relief.\\n\\n\\\"From the recall of Baron von Reidsel and the marching of your majesty's, troops into Bohemia, I perceive with profoundest sorrow that we are on, the eve of another war. My age, and sincere love of peace, are known to, all the world, and I can give no greater proof of this love than I do by, writing to your majesty. My maternal heart, too, is sorely grieved with, the thought that I have two sons and a beloved son-in-law in the army. I, have taken this step without the knowledge of the emperor, and whatever, its result, I exact that it shall remain a secret between us. It is my, desire to resume the negotiations which were broken off by my son. Baron, Thugut, who will deliver this into your majesty's hands, has received my, instructions, and is empowered to treat with you. I trust that your, majesty may deem it consistent with our common dignity to meet my wishes, in this matter, and hope that you also correspond to the earnest desire, which I cherish for a continuation of friendly relations with your, majesty. With this hope I remain, \\\"Your majesty's affectionate sister, and cousin, \\\"MARIA THERESA.\\\" [Footnote: This letter was written in the, French language, and is to be found in Cross-Hoffinger's \\\"Life and, History of the Reign of Joseph II.,\\\" vol. iv., p. 89.]\\n\\nThe countess remained looking at the parer for a time, then she raised, her tearful eyes to the face of the empress. \\\"I thank your majesty,\\\", said she, deeply moved, \\\"for allowing me to see this letter. It will, remain in history as a noble monument of Maria Theresa's rectitude. I, have no longer a word of blame for you; and once again, in love and, reverence, I kiss this hand, although I know that to-day it must sign, the death-warrant of unhappy Poland.\\\"\\n\\nIt was natural, then, that the majority of the Aulic Council should vote, for the old alliance. While they argued and voted, Kaunitz, the least, important personage of them all, sat perfectly unconcerned, paying not, the slightest attention to the wise deductions of his colleagues. He, seemed much occupied in straightening loose papers, mending his pen, and, removing with his finger-tips the tiny, specks that flecked the lustre, of his velvet coat. Once, while Bartenstein was delivering his long, address, Kaunitz carried his indifference so far as to draw out his, repeater (on which was painted a portrait of La Pompadour, set in, diamonds) and strike the hour! The musical ring of the little bell, sounded a fairy accompaniment to the deep and earnest tones of, Bartenstein's voice; while Kaunitz, seeming to hear nothing else, held, the watch up to his ear and counted its strokes. [Footnote: Vide, Kormayr, \\\"Austrian Plutarch,\\\" vol. xii., p.352.] The empress, who was, accustomed to visit the least manifestation of such inattention on the, part of her councillors with open censure--the empress, so observant of, form, and so exacting of its observance in others--seemed singularly, indulgent to-day; for while Kaunitz was listening to the music of his, watch, his imperial mistress looked on with half a smile. At last, when, the fifth orator had spoken, and it became the turn of Kaunitz to vote\\n\\nSuddenly she turned toward Father Porhaminer, who, with the Countess, Fuchs, stood by the side of the sofa from which she had risen. \\\"Father,\\\", said she, in a tremulous voice, \\\"I cannot tell why it is that, as I, await my son's presence here, my heart is overwhelmed with anguish. I, feel as if I were about to do him an injustice, and for all the kingdoms, of the world I would not do him wrong.\\\"\\n\\nThe elite of Vienna were assembled in the drawing-room of Herr von, Paradies. The aristocratic, the scientific, and the artistic world were, represented; and the empress, as before intimated, had sent her, messenger to take notes of the extraordinary experiment which was that, day to be tried upon the person of her young pensioner. At the request, of Mesmer, some of the lower classes were there also, for it was his, desire that the cottage as well as the palace should bear testimony to, the triumph of animal magnetism over the prejudices of conventional, science.\\n\\nThe emperor shook his lead. \\\"Were this true,\\\" replied he, \\\"Poland would, never have fallen as she has done. But far be it from me to heap, reproaches upon the unfortunate. I will do what it lies in my power to, do for the Poles, provided they are willing to second my efforts for, themselves. If they would have peace, however, with other nations, they, must show strength and unity of purpose among themselves. Until they can, stand before the world in the serried ranks of a national unanimity\\n\\nShe broke into a loud laugh, and striking her horse with the whip, tried, to gallop off again. But the emperor put spurs to his horse, and the two, dashed on together. Neck and neck they ran; the countess lashing her, Arabian until he made wild leaps into the air, the emperor urging his, Barb with whip and spur, until his flanks were white with foam. At last, he came so near, that he made a grasp at her rein and caught it\\n\\nand foreign influence. To that intent, my lord chamberlain, you will see, that all foreigners are dismissed from the palace, and their places, supplied by Germans. My two Italian valets I make over to Porhammer., Nothing but German shall be spoken at court. I will have neither French, nor Italian actors here. Count Durazzo shall dismiss his foreign troupes, and employ Germans in their stead. [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, \\\"History, of Joseph II.,\\\" vol. i., p. 91.] Let him see that the German stage, flourishes and does honor to the metropolis of the German empire.\\\"\\n\\n, The beautiful Countess Baillou was about to give a ball. She had invited, all the haut ton of Vienna, and they had accepted the invitations. And, yet the countess had been but four weeks in the Austrian capital; she, had no relations there, and none of the aristocracy had ever heard her, name before. But she had come to Vienna provided with letters of, introduction, and money; and these two keys had opened the saloons of, the fashionables to the beautiful stranger.\\n\\n\\\"And she, too, deceived me,\\\" said he; \\\"those smiles, those glances, that, love, all were false. While she lay in my arms and listened to my words, of love, her heart was in the grave with her murdered lover! Oh, my God!, now that I know that she deceived me, in whom can I place my trust? Even, now, what am I but a dependent boy, the slave of the empress and of her, all-powerful minister, who force upon me a woman whom I hate, and bid me, make her the mother of my children? Oh, when will my shackles fall, when, shall I be free!\\\"\\n\\nZweibrucken, and Saxony, had been disentangling the threads of the, Bavarian succession. For three months Joseph had hoped and prayed that, the debates of the peace congress might come to naught, and its, deliberations engender a veritable war. But he was destined to new, disappointment. The love of peace had prevailed. Austria had renounced, all her inheritance in Bavaria, save the Innviertel, and had declared, her treaty with Charles Theodore to be null and void.\\n\\nThe preparations were at an end; the archduke bad taken formal leave of, his mother's court; this evening he was to spend in the imperial family, circle; and early on the next morning his journey would begin. He had, just written a last note of farewell to a friend. Alone in his room, he, stood before a mirror, contemplating with a smile his own image. He was, not looking at his handsome face, though happiness was lending it, exquisite beauty; the object of his rapturous admiration was the white, uniform, which, for the first time, he wore in place of his court-dress., He was no longer the descendant of Charles the Fifth, no longer the son, of the empress, he was a soldier--a free, self-sustaining man, whose, destiny lay in his own hands, and whose future deeds would prove him, worthy to be the son of his great ancestor.\\n\\nThe empress smiled, while Kaunitz knelt and kissed her fair, jewelled, hand. \\\"May God grant that you speak truth, Kaunitz, and may my posterity, not have to blush for me! 'Every thing for Austria,' shall be your motto, and mine; and this flaming device shall light us on our way through, life. Now go, lord high chancellor, and see that the world finds a, phoenix in the ashes of the old regime which to-day we have consigned to, the dust!\\\" [Footnote: From this time, Kaunitz was the sole minister of, the empress; and he kept his promise to Binder, who became state, referendarius, in the place of the once-powerful Bartenstein.]\\n\\nShe was radiant with smiles, and happiness flashed from her still bright, eyes; but on this day of rejoicing there was one void that pained the, empress--it was the absence of her eldest son. Since his return to, Vienna, three months before, there had never yet been a word of, explanation between Joseph and his mother. He had studiously avoided, being alone with her, had never made his appearance in council, and when, documents had been presented to him for signature, he had no sooner, perceived the sign-manual of the empress, than he had added his own, without examination or comment.\\n\\n\\\"So it is, so it is,\\\" shouted the multitude. \\\"The queen owes us a, rose-bud, and we must have it.\\\" \\\"See here, pretty queen,\\\" cried another, fish-wife, \\\"it is your fault if we stand here on the staircases and out, in the hot sun to-day. If you had done your duty to France instead of, leaving it to the princess in yonder, the lackeys would have been, obliged to open the doors to us as well as to the great folks, and we, would have jostled the dukes and princes, and taken our ease on your, velvet sofas. The next time we come here, we must have a tramp into the, queen's room, and she must let us see herself and a brave dauphin, too.\\\"\\n\\nThe curtain rose, and, in a funeral hall, Orpheus poured forth his grief, for the loss of his Eurydice. With this pathetic complaint mingled the, voices of the chorus of mourners; then a solo from Orpheus, in which he, bewails anew the fate of the noble woman who had died for his sake. The, god of love appears, counselling him to descend himself to the infernal, regions. Orpheus, strengthened and revived by hope, resolves to tempt, the dangerous descent, and calls upon his friends to share his fate.\\n\\nJosepha was sad as she thought of these things, but she could not, suppress an emotion of joy when she saw the brilliant cortege hat was, coming from Vienna to meet her. This proud and handsome horseman, whose, blue eyes shone like stars, this was her husband, the lord of her, destiny! She had seen him once before, and had loved him from that, moment. True, he had not chosen her from inclination, but she could not, shut her heart to the bliss of being his wife, he who, to-day a king\\n\\n\\\"Yes, her life,\\\" said Van Swieten, solemnly. \\\"The empress has the, small-pox.\\\" [Footnote: The Empress Josepha died May 28, 1767, at the age, of twenty nine years. Her body was so decayed by small pox, that, before, her death the flesh fell from her in pieces. It was so completely, decomposed, that it was impossible to pay it the customary funeral, honors. It was hurriedly wrapped up in a linen cloth, and coffined. From, these circumstances a rumor prevailed in Bavaria that she had not died\\n\\n\\\"You must weigh well your behavior toward the czarina. I dare not advise, the emperor, but let me advise you. You have often occasion to see the, empress. Before you see her consult with me as to the topics of your, discourse with her, and so we shall always be enabled to act in concert., Avoid ail dissimulation; let her perceive that you leave craft to the, lovers of Prussia. Flatter as often as you see fit; flatter Catharine\\n\\n\\\"By all means. Let us hope that they bring us good news. I gave, stringent orders to Belgiojoso to see that my will was carried out in, Belgium. I bade him inform the people that they should not: have their, precious soap-boiler back; that he was my subject, and I intended to, have him tried here. I told him, moreover, that, like all my other, subjects, the Belgians must pay new taxes without expecting to be, consulted as to the expediency of the measure.\\\"\\n\\nDown went the obsequious heads, while Kaunitz continued, with his fine, cambric handkerchief, to remove the last specks of powder from his, eyelids. When he had sufficiently caressed and admired himself, he went, to the door. It opened, and two valets, who stood outside, presented, him, one with a jewelled snuff-box, the other with an embroidered, handkerchief. A large brown dog, that lay couchant in the hall, rose and, followed him, and the last act of the daily farce was over.\\n\\n\\\"I am revenged!\\\" thought he. \\\"Short-sighted emperor, you do not dream, that you arc the tool wherewith the Jew has wreaked his vengeance upon, the Christian! Go on, and ruin your faithful friend! Go on, hot-headed, judge; punish the man who loves you, without giving him a hearing; and, imagine yourself to be administering justice, while you inflict the, grossest injustice. It is so Christian-like. Follow the instincts of, your love and hate, your passion or your pleasures, ye children of the, moment, while the calculating Jew plays upon your credulity!--And now\\n\\nThere wanted now but a few months to complete the third year of the, archduke's marriage, and the young princesses seized every opportunity, to make schemes of pleasure for the joyous anniversary. Isabella viewed, these projects with a mournful smile. Her countenance became sadder and, more serious, except when in the presence of her husband. There she, assumed an appearance of gayety: laughing, jesting, and drawing from her, violin its sweetest sounds. But, with her attendants, or in the company, of the other members of the imperial family, she was melancholy, and, made her preparations for death, which she foretold would overtake her, very soon.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you had better defer your journey for a day to attend her, funeral. All the Poles will be there; and as we both knew and admired, her, I think it would propitiate our new subjects if we gave some public, mark of sympathy by following the body to the grave. I have forbidden, mention to be made of the manner of her death, that she may not be, denied a resting-place within consecrated ground.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" said the emperor, with a deep sigh, \\\"be it so. I will do, as you like, but I must for ever and ever yield my will to that of, others. Call a deputation of the provinces, and cite the, governor-general and his wife, also to Vienna. I will investigate as a, father before I condemn as a judge. But if this last proof of my, goodness should be of no avail, then I shall strike; and if blood flow, in torrents-upon their heads and not mine, be the sin.\\\" [Footnote:, Joseph's own words. Seo Hubner, ii., p. 454.]\\n\\nJoseph looked with genuine emotion at the agitated countenance of his, mother. He saw the tears gather and fall from her eyes; he saw the, quivering lip, the trembling frame; he felt that her integrity was, beyond suspicion, her love for him beyond all question. The icy barriers, that had closed upon his heart, gave way; he felt the warm and sunny, glow of a mother's unspeakable love, and, yielding to the impulse of the, moment, he flung his arms around the empress's neck, while he covered, her face with kisses. \\\"Mother, my dear mother!\\\" sobbed he; and as if, these words had opened the floodgates of all the love which filled his, heart, he leaned his head upon her bosom, and was silent.\\n\\n\\\"Hm; something very like it, I assure you. Listen! It is the secret, treaty that our minister at Constantinople, Herr von Thugut, has just, concluded with the Porte. The Sultan has already signed it, and to-day I, shall present it for signature to the empress. She will do it readily;, for although she may not absolutely dote on the infidel, she hates, Russia; and the unbelieving Turk is dearer to her than her Christian, cousin, the Empress Catharine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not pretend to judge of the acts of the rulers of earth,\\\" replied, he gloomily. \\\"Perhaps the deeds which in ordinary people would be called, cowardly, may with them be great and noble. I know nothing about it; but, I know what my beloved empress once said to me. She was then young and, energetic, and she had not forgotten the oath she had taken when the, archbishop crowned her at St. Stephen's--the oath which bound her to be, a faithful ruler over her people until God released her.\\\"\\n\\nIn a quarter of an hour they had reached the village. The same absence, of all life struck painfully upon the emperor's heart as they walked, along the deserted streets and heard nothing save the echo of their own, footsteps. Not the lowing of a cow nor the bleating of a sheep, not one, familiar rural sound broke the mournful stillness that brooded over the, air. Occasionally a ghastly figure in tattered garments, from whose, vacant eyes the light of reason seemed to have fled, was seen crouching, at the door of a hut, wherein his wife and children were starving. This, was the only token of life that greeted the eyes of the grave and silent, pair.\\n\\nThe truth was, that Louis was envious of the enthusiasm which Joseph, excited among the Parisians; and his brothers, the other members of the, royal family, and his ministers, took every opportunity of feeding his, envy, by representing that the emperor was doing his utmost to alienate, the affections of the French from their rightful sovereign; that he was, meditating the seizure of Alsace and Lorraine; that he was seeking to, reinstate De Choiseul, and convert France into a mere dependency upon, Austria.\\n\\nand in high satisfaction kicked his feet against the dash-board, and, watched the motion of the wheels. Now and then he vented his delight by, a broad smile, in which I could detect no trace of a suspicion as to my, rank of majesty. Finally I resolved to find out what place I occupied in, the estimation of an unfledged shoemaker; so I questioned him on the, subject. He contemplated me for a moment, and then said, `Perhaps you, might be an equerry?'--'Guess higher,' replied I. 'Well, a count?'--I, shook my head. 'Still higher.'--'A prince?'--'Higher yet.'--'Well\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty,\\\" said Etienne, in a voice choked with tears, \\\"you have, made my child famous. For a hundred years the honor you have conferred, upon him will be the wonder of our neighborhood, and never will the, people of Vitry forget the condescension of your majesty in sitting, among us as an equal and a guest. My son is a Frenchman at heart he, shall also be a German, like our own beautiful queen, who is both, Austrian and French. God bless and preserve you both! Long live our, queen, Marie Antoinette, and long live her noble brother, the Emperor of, Austria!\\\"\\n\\nand it is evident that Austrians are less corrupt than Frenchmen, for I, am told that Count von Mercy and Prince Kaunitz are au fait to every, thing that transpires in the palace here. Be that as it may, we intend, to follow the example of the queen. Our policy shall be so frank and, honorable that all the world may know it and welcome. But--it occurs to, me that the mistress of ceremonies is in great anguish of mind. She will, not recover her equanimity until she sees you again, count.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I see that they are watchful,\\\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, \\\"I see it., Do not deny it, you are one of those whose evil eyes see evil doings in, every impulse of my dear defenceless child's heart. But have a care, sir, cardinal, the friendless dauphiness will one day be Queen of France, and, she will then have it in her power to bring to justice those who, persecute her now!\\\" [Footnote: \\\"Memoires de Madame de Campan,\\\" vol. i.\\n\\n\\\"Why? Because I feel it my duty to leave nothing undone which can be, conducive to the interests and glory of our holy mother, the church.

I must see this, man who, from youth to old age, has defied the Lord of heaven and, earth!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, tell me, which of us is better calculated to reign in, Austria--Joseph or myself? Which of us will best promote the welfare of, the Austrian people? Do not answer me at once. Take time to reflect upon, the subject, for a, weighty question lies in the balance of this hour. I, cannot trust myself in this decision, for I have wept so many tears that, I have not the strength to see wherein my duty lies. I cannot even trust, my own misgivings, for pride or vanity may have blinded my eyes to, truth. I am not sure that I view things in their proper light. It is, useless, therefore, for me to speak. I desire to hear no one but, yourself. I swear to you by the memory of Charles V., that, whatever you, say shall be sacred; for I have exacted of you candor--and say what you, will, your candor shall not offend. Who, then, is best fitted to reign\\n\\nWith more activity than she bad been able to summon to her help since, the emperor's burial, Maria Theresa to her dressing-room, and snatching, up her long, black cloak, threw it around her person. As she was drawing, the hood over her face, she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror, close by. She was shocked at her own image; her face so corpse-like, her, cloak so like a hideous pall.\\n\\nThen she returned home, and, without a word, retired to her own, apartments. There, on a table, lay heaps of papers and letters with, unbroken seals. But the empress heeded nothing of all this. Maternity, reigned supreme in her heart--there was room in it for grief and remorse, alone. She strode to the window, and there, as she had done not many, days before, she looked out upon the gray towers of the chapel, and, thought how she had driven her own precious child into the dismal depths, of its loathsome vaults.\\n\\nAt Kaunitz's dinner-table on that day revelry reigned triumphant. No, jest was too bold for the lips of the men; and if perchance upon the, cheeks of their beautiful companions there rose the slightest flush of, womanly shame, the knights of the revel shouted applause, and pealed, forth their praises in wildest dithyrambics. With glowing faces and eyes, of flame they ate their highly-spiced viands, and drank their fiery, wines, until all restraint was flung aside, and madness ruled the hour.\\n\\n\\\"True, true,\\\" returned she, in an unsteady voice. \\\"Go, father, and begin, my work of reform, by casting out that wicked woman from among the, unhappy wives of Vienna. I myself will announce her departure to the, emperor. And now, dear friends, leave me. You, father, to Count, Bartenstein. Countess, recall Charlotte, and send me my tire-women. Let, the princes and princesses be regally attired to-day. I will meet the, emperor in their midst.\\\"\\n\\nI prayed that every obstacle might encumber his advance: and oh, my, beloved! when I heard that thou wert coming, I almost wished thee buried, under Alpine avalanches. When I was told of thy arrival, I longed to fly, away from Vienna, from rank and royalty, to some far country, some, secluded spot, where no reasons of state policy would force me to give, my hand to an unknown bride. Was I not a barbarian, sweetest, was I not, an arch-traitor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If Poland must succumb, I will act as becomes my station and, responsibilities as the sovereign of a great empire, and I will do that, which the wisdom and prudence of my mother shall dictate to her son.

Tell me that you love me as a woman ought to love, having no, God, no faith, no country, but her lover; losing her identity and living, for his happiness alone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have been profitable laborers to him, my lord. For several years, past, his corn-fields have been weighed down with golden tassels that, made the heart leap with joy at sight of their beauty. He had so much, that his barns would not hold it, and he had to put up other great, barns, thatched with straw, to shelter it. This year, it is true, he has, reaped nothing, but what of that? His barns are still full to, overflowing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you have heard that ridiculous story, which was invented by, Monsieur de Choiseul? Nobody here ever believed it; and let me tell you, that the Countess de Vergennes enjoys the esteem and consideration of, all who know her. Vergennes himself is a man of talent, and will do me, good service.

You, the handsome and admired Count, Schulenberg--you who fancied you were throwing me the handkerchief of, your favor, you are nothing to me but the convenient implement of my, revenge. You came hither as my valet, and as I no longer need a valet, I, discharge you. You have served me well, and I thank you.

The countess, when, questioned, answered unhesitatingly, that one half the sum she had won, at play, and the other half she had received as a present from Colonel, Szekuly. It was well known that Szekuly had not the means of bestowing, such princely gifts; yet, when informed of the countess's charge, he had, grown pale, but replied that the countess had spoken nothing but truth.\\n\\n\\\"Of course it is lost to her,\\\" replied Berth, enjoying the sudden, paleness which overspread the radiant face of Von Paradies. \\\"A girl who, sees has no right to the money which is given to the blind, and I heard, Von Stork this very day saying that as soon as it was proved that your, daughter could see, he intended to apply to the empress for her pension, in behalf of another party.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am a simpleton,\\\" thought she. \\\"I must forget the dreams of a, delirious nun. How could I be so weak as to imagine that God would, permit an hysterical invalid to prophesy to a sound and strong woman, like myself? I will speak with Father Gassner.

Order two carriages, and send one for Signora, Ferlina, and the other for Signora Sacco. Send two footmen to Counts, Harrach and Colloredo, with my compliments. Stay--here is a list of the, other guests. Send a messenger to the apartments of my sister, the, countess. Tell her, with my respects, to oblige me by dining to-day in, her own private rooms.

As long as he was an invalid, he, should be hers alone. In her room, and through her loving care, should, he find returning health.

Altogether\\n\\n\\\"Pray give me your arm. I have but one more observation to make. I hope, that you will now be able to prove substantially to the emperor that it, was quite useless for him to shelter himself behind the words, 'I shall, claim thee in heaven!' But if I may presume so far, I request that you, will defer these demonstrations until I return from Rome with my letters, of divorce.\\\"\\n\\nFor some time the empress walked up and down her room, undecided whether, to turn the sibylline leaves or not. It might be sinful to question, it, might be fatal to remain ignorant. Was it, or was it not the will of, God, that she should pry into the great mystery of futurity? Surely it, could not be sinful, else why should He have given to His servants the, gift of prophecy?\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, I know something of the vanity of authors,\\\" said the empress., \\\"They imagine themselves to be Atlas, each one with the world upon his, shoulders, which must certainly fall, if they are not there to uphold, it. I, however, take the liberty of judging that if they were all to be, blown to atoms, nobody would be the worse for their disappearance. What, has come of your writings?

For the moment her widow's sorrows were, forgotten; and when surrounded by so many loyal hearts, she sank on her, knees before the altar of St. Stephen, she thanked God for the joy of, this hour, and made a vow that her whole life should be devoted to the, welfare of the people who on this day had given her so touching a, welcome.\\n\\nThe dessert was on the table. The guests were indulging themselves in, some of those post-prandial effusions which are apt to blossom from, heads overheated by wine, and are generally richer in words than in, wisdom. The host, with flattering preliminaries, had proposed the health, of the ladies, and every goblet sparkled to the brim. Just at that, moment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear., He turned, smiling to his guests and, apologizing for the interruption\\n\\nOn the evening of which we speak, the empress was at the card-table. But, those great, glowing eyes were roving from one side of the room to the, other in restless anxiety. Sometimes, for a moment, they rested upon the, emperor who was standing near the table in conversation with some, provincial nobleman. The cheerful and unconcerned demeanor of her son, seemed to reassure the empress, who turned to her cards, and tried to, become interested in the game. Not far off, the archduchesses, too, were, at cards, and the hum of conversation subsided almost to a whisper, that, the imperial party might not be disturbed. Gradually the empress became, absorbed in her cards, so that she was unobservant of the entrance of, one of the emperor's lords in waiting who whispered something in, Joseph's ear, whereupon the latter left the room in haste.\\n\\n\\\"I speak of Madame Etiquette, your majesty. She is a stiff and tiresome, old dame, I grant you, but in France she presides over every thing., Without her the royal family can neither sleep nor wake; they can, neither take a meal if they be in health, nor a purge if they be, indisposed, without her everlasting surveillance. She directs their, dress, amusements, associates, and behavior; she presides over their, pleasures, their weariness, their social hours, and their hours of, solitude. This may be uncomfortable, but royalty cannot escape it, and, it must he endured.\\\"\\n\\nMarie Antoinette recovered her self-possession, and looked with perfect, serenity toward the high and mighty duchess, whose titles were being, pompously enumerated by the punctilious mistress of ceremonies. As ill, luck would have it, this one was older, uglier, and more strangely, bedizened than all the others together. The queen felt a spasmodic, twitch of her face; she colored violently, and opening her fan again, it, was evident to all that assemblage of censorious dames that for the, second time youth and animal spirits had prevailed over decorum.\\n\\n\\\"Let her remain, your majesty,\\\" cried Joseph with a burst of wrath, \\\"she, is in her proper place. But if she means to kneel until she has obtained, my forgiveness, let her kneel throughout all eternity! I consented to, this marriage for expediency's sake, and I would have done my best to, make the burden as light for us both as lay in my power. Your majesty, knows how she has deceived me; you have heard her pitiful lie with its, pitiful excuse. I might have forgiven her for marrying me, with her, disgusting disease, but for being a liar--never!\\\"\\n\\nPrince Kaunitz was in his cabinet. Baron Binder was reading aloud the, secret dispatches which had just come in from the Austrian ambassador at, Berlin, the young Baron van Swieten. Meanwhile, Kaunitz was busy with a, brush of peacock's feathers, dusting the expensive trifles that covered, his escritoire, or polishing its ebony surface with a fine silk, handkerchief which he kept for the purpose. This furbishing of trinkets, and furniture was a private pastime with the all-powerful minister; and, many a personage of rank was made to wait in the anteroom, while he, finished his dusting or rearranged his bijouterie, until it was grouped, to his satisfaction.\\n\\nas far as she is able, assimilate herself to the customs and language of, her people. With that intention, Prince Kaunitz has commissioned the, Duke de Choiseul to select you a new teacher. He will be accompanied by, two French ladies of honor.

I flatter myself that the French cannot compete with us in, music. Study well, and try to deserve the brilliant destiny in store for, you.\\\"\\n\\nShe received the two travellers with much grace and affability; and, whereas the curates were to have been placed beside her at table, she, assigned them to her husband, and invited the strangers to the seats, instead. She informed them of the names and station of every person, present, and then related to them how the winter previous, at the ball, of the sub-prefect, she had danced the whole evening, while some of the, prettiest girls in the room had wanted partners.\\n\\nThe ceremonial was over. The empress herself had conducted the young, Queen of Rome to her apartments; and she had stood by her side, while, her tire-woman exchanged her dress of golden tissue for a light white, negligee of finest cambric trimmed with costly lace. With her own hand, Maria Theresa unfastened the myrtle-wreath and coronet of diamonds that, encircled her daughter-in-law's brow. She then kissed Josepha, affectionately, and, bidding her good-night, she besought the blessing, of God upon both her children.\\n\\nA brilliant crowd thronged the apartments of the Princess d'Artois. The, royal family, the court, and the lords and ladies of high rank were, assembled in her reception-rooms, for close by an event of highest, importance to France was about to transpire. The princess was giving, birth to a scion of royalty. The longings of France were about to be, fulfilled--the House of Bourbon was to have an heir to its greatness.\\n\\n\\\"No commonplaces, Quarin, no equivocation,\\\" cried Joseph, impatiently., \\\"I must have the truth, do you hear me?--the truth.

And yet, I thank Heaven that you are mine for these few fleeting moments, for, they have taken me back to the days of my youth and its beautiful, illusions!

Madame Victoire, who really, loves the dauphiness, is so sickly, that she scarcely ever leaves her, room.

I am not aware that we are in the carnival; nor have I an, unmarried daughter for whom any French prince can have sent you to, propose. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"How very fortunate it is that this particular piece of land should, belong to Austria!\\\" said the king; with a slight sneer. \\\"You see that, Poland, who for so many centuries had supposed herself to be the, rightful owner of the Zips, has, in virtue of such ownership, projected, beyond the Carpathian Mountains quite to the interior of Hungary. Now a, wedge of that sort is inconvenient, perhaps dangerous, and it is lucky, for Austria that she has found out her right of possession in that, quarter. It not only contracts her neighbor's domains, but essentially, increases her own. It now concerns Austria to prove to Europe her right, to this annexation, for Europe is somewhat astonished to hear of it. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"So much the better.

Why is that Joseph so niggardly that one cannot feel the, slightest interest in him? If after refusing all other invitations he, had paid me the compliment of accepting mine--but, no!--this haughty, Austrian treats me with as little consideration as be does the rest of, the world; and forces me, in spite of myself, to the side of Frederick., But there I find Orloff and Panin, and we cannot work together.

It being, only a princess who was in labor, and not a queen, none but the royal, family and the ministers were admitted into her bedchamber. The, aristocracy waited in the reception-rooms, the people in the corridors, and galleries. Had it been Marie Antoinette, all the doors would have, been thrown open to her subjects.

It is expedient for the, present that Austria and Prussia should be quasi allies, for in this way, peace has been secured to Europe. But my system of diplomacy, which the, empress has made her own, forbids me to make any permanent alliance with, a prince who lives politically from hand to mouth, and has no fixed line, of policy.

But the empress, usually so affable at, her toilet, surveyed both maids and apparel with gloomy indifference.

Austria, too, would esteem it a, great misfortune if Russia should come into possession of the Crimea and, the Black Sea. Her dominion over the Black Sea would be more dangerous, to Europe than an extension of her territory.

It was evening, and the fiery gold of the setting sun was, mirrored in the waves of the Rhine which with gentle murmur were toying, with the greensward that sloped gracefully down to the water's edge. The, emperor gave the word to halt, and rising from his seat, looked back, upon the long line of carriages that followed in his wake.\\n\\n\\\"My dear son,\\\" said the empress, \\\"I cannot view this undertaking with, your eyes; I am old and timid, and I shudder with apprehension of the, demon that follows in the wake of ambition.

Let me go to my, Franz blessed by the tears and regrets of my subjects--let me appear, before posterity as an upright and peace-loving empress. But I have said, that I am old--so old that I mistrust my own judgment. It may be that I, mistake pusillanimity for disinterestedness. Speak, Kaunitz--so far you, have been silent.

I do not believe a word of what the Count de Provence's valet, says, that he wants to take Alsace and Lorraine, and has come to France, to change the ministry.

She hung down her head, and large, scalding tears fell from her eyes. Count Kinsky placed her in the, carriage, closed the door, and then returned to his own, travelling-chariot, which was a few paces behind. The two equipages, thundered down the streets together, but at the gates they parted, the, one taking the road for Hungary, the other for Rome. [Footnote: This, whole story is Historical. The \\\"heavenly Therese,\\\" as she is called by, Hormayer, was really married and thus abandoned by her husband, who, persisted in believing that the connection between herself and the, emperor was not guiltless. But the count met with no success in the, matter of the divorce. The pope refused.]\\n\\n\\\"Since such is your faith in me, my Egeria, you will then have courage, to hear what I have to tell.

They are the offspring of our affected, and falsely sentimental times, and deserve not immortality. Away with, them! A new day shall begin for me, or I shall hide my head in bitter, solitude, despising my race, who applaud the juggler, and turn away in, coldness from the veritable artiste.\\\"\\n\\nHe then turned to the emperor, and presenting the young Prince of, Prussia and the two Princes of Brunswick, he pointed to the white, uniforms which they wore, and said: \\\"Sire, I bring you some new, recruits. [Footnote: The king wore the Austrian uniform, embroided with, silver. The princes and the king's suite also wore it.] We are all, desirous of serving under your banner. And we feel that it would be an, honor,\\\" continued he, looking around the square, \\\"to be the, companions-in-arms of your majesty's soldiers, for each man looks like a, true son of Mars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will have to go to the kitchen, sir. There you will find a flitch, of bacon. Cut off some slices, put them in a pan you will see there, and, set it on the fire. My neighbor has just now made some for poor John., Then look on the dresser and take some milk and a little flour. Make a, batter of them with the eggs, pour it upon your bacon, and when the eggs, are done, the omelet is made. It is the easiest thing in the world.\\\"\\n\\nTo this the king bowed in silence. He was so weary of his walk that he, led the way to a road by which a short-cut might be made to the palace., This road was crossed by an avenue of trees which bordered a large iron, gate leading to the front entrance of the palace. Here the people were, accustomed to assemble to obtain a view of their sovereigns; and to-day, the throng was greater than usual, for they had learned from the Swiss, guard that the two monarchs were out together, and thousands of eager, eyes were watching for the glittering uniforms of the gardes de corps.\\n\\nOne speculating jeweller, alone, honored the memory of the deceased, king, and made his fortune thereby. He manufactured a mourning, snuff-box, of black shagreen, whose lid was ornamented with a portrait, of the queen. He called his boxes \\\"La consolation, dans le, chagrin,\\\"[Footnote: \\\"Mbmoires de Madame de Campan\\\" vol. i., p. 91.] and, his portrait and pun became so popular, that in less than a week he had, sold a hundred thousand of these boxes.[Footnote: This word \\\"chagrin,\\\", signifies not only grief, but also that preparation of leather, which\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" cried he, \\\"from this day you shall be better pleased than you, have been with me of late--I have seen your reproving looks--nay, do, not deny it, for they have been as significant as words; and if I made, no answer, it was perhaps because I was guilty, and had nothing to say., You have sighed over my dejection for months past, dear friend, but it, has vanished with the tidings I have just received I am ready to rush, out into the storm, bold and defiant as Ajax!\\\"\\n\\nand many of the ladies had their handkerchiefs to their eyes. Everybody, was touched except Professor Barth. He, on the contrary, was chuckling, with satisfaction, and felt much more inclined to applaud than to, commiserate. He looked at Ingenhaus, who, not being in the secret, was, divided between sympathy for the father and indignation toward the, charlatan. Indeed, he had so far forgotten his own interest in the, scene, that he was weeping with the rest.\\n\\n\\\"Louis was not born like his predecessors, and it is generally believed, that he will not die a natural death. Not a single member of the royal, family was present at his birth. When, overtaken by the pangs of, childbirth, his mother was accidentally alone in the palace of, Versailles; and the heir of France, upon his entrance into life, was, received by some insignificant stranger. The courier who was sent to, announce his birth fell from his horse and was killed on the spot. The, Abbe de Saujon, who was called in to christen the infant, was struck by, apoplexy while entering the chapel door, and his arm and tongue were, paralyzed. [Footnote: \\\"Memoires de Madame de Creque,\\\" vol. iii., p., 179.] From hundreds of healthy women the physician of the dauphiness, chose three nurses for the prince. At the end of a week two of them were, dead, and the third one, Madame Guillotine, after nursing him for six, weeks, was carried of by small-pox. Even the frivolous grandfather was, terrified by such an accumulation of evil omens, and he was heard to, regret that he had given to his grandson the title of Duke de Berry\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the princess, passionately, \\\"and look at me. You have known, me since my infancy, dear friend, therefore you need not flatter me, because of my station. Look at me, and tell me if it is not enough to, break my heart, that I must appear before this beautiful empress and her, daughters, and that I must try to win the affections of this prince, the, glance of whose eye is enough to kindle love in the heart of every woman, living--oh say, and speak without reserve--tell me if a woman so, obscure, so ignorant, and so destitute of charms, can ever hope to be, loved or cherished by such a family?\\\"\\n\\nThe feast was at an end, and as Kaunitz reviewed the faces of the, company and saw that for the day their passions were weary from, indulgence, he said to himself, with diabolical calmness: \\\"Now that they, have exhausted every other pleasure, we will sharpen the blunted edge of, desire with gambling! When the life of the heart is burnt to ashes, it, will still revive at the chink of gold.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor laughed a sardonic laugh. \\\"What need have I of a state, councillor, I who am but a puppet in the hands of my mother, I who must, stand, with shackled arms, and look on while she reigns? But it is in, vain to murmur. I watch and wait; and while I wait, I find myself, inclining fast to your policy. I believe you to be an honorable, statesman, and I believe also that the course you have pursued, you have, chose because you are convinced that it is wise.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor laughed again. \\\"What do you fear, my friend?\\\" asked he., \\\"Have you so long shared with me my burden of dissimulation, that you, are frightened to see our shackles fall? Are you afraid of the fresh, air, because we wear our masks no longer? Patience, Rosenberg, and al, will be well with us. Our dreams are about to be fulfilled: what we have, whispered together in the twilight of mutual trust, we may now cry out, with free and joyous shouts--'Reform! reform!' My people have prayed, quite enough, they shall now learn to do something better--they shall, think; they have been long enough led by faith, like little children. I, will give them confirmation, and they shall enter upon the, responsibilities of manhood. I mean to be a blessing to the virtuous\\n\\n\\\"She will surely be there before many hours. Solitude is not congenial, to Maria Theresa's heart; her active mind craves occupation, and her, grief requires it. Let us appeal to her affections through the illness, of her child, and complete reaction will ensue. If once we can persuade, her to quit her seclusion, the cloister-dream is over. Let us all work, in concert to restore her to the world. It is not the sovereign of a, great nation who has a right like Mary to sit at the feet of Jesus. Go, at once, Count Bathiany, and may God bless the efforts we are making to, restore our empress to her sense of duty. Church and state are alike, endangered by the fatal step she has taken.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know it, poor man; he is at the top and bottom of all the trouble. I, beseech you, chere Anna, let us put aside politics; I cannot see what, pleasure a woman can find in such tiresome things. Mon Dieu, there are, so many other things more pleasing as well as more important! For, instance: how do people pass their time in Vienna? Have you many lovers?, Do you go to many balls?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The people of Bavaria well know what is to be their fate if they fall, into the hands of the elector palatine. Surrounded by mistresses with, swarms of natural children, his sole object in life will be to plunder, his subjects that he may enrich a progeny to whom he can lave neither, name nor crown. Oh, your majesty, be generous, and rescue the Bavarians, from a war of succession; for the elector palatine has no heir, and his, death will be the signal for new strife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" said the banker, advancing with his flambeau. Podstadsky, hesitated. If his sense of honor was dead, his vanity was not; and it, winced at the slightest touch of ridicule. Was there no escape from this, absurd escort? He looked around and saw no hope of rescue. Behind him, Rachel had locked the door, and the servants were so closely ranged, together that it was vain to attempt a passage through that living wall, of fire. He had no alternative but to laugh derisively and step into the, ranks. The procession moved on, and gathered strength as it moved; for, on the staircase in the lower hall, and at the front of the house, they, were joined by throng after throng, each man of which, like the, commander-in-chief, was armed with a flambeau. This was bad enough of, itself, but the count's body-guard were all in a titter, and every man, enjoyed the jest except himself.\\n\\n\\\"They have passed by,\\\" exclaimed he joyfully. \\\"This day is mine, and I, am free. What a charm is in that word FREEDOM! I feel it now; no emperor, am I, but a man, to whom the animals will turn their backs, without, suspecting that they refuse to look upon an anointed sovereign. But, hark! what is that? A doe--a timid doe--perhaps an enchanted princess, who can resume her shape at the bidding of a prince only. Here am I\\n\\n\\\"No, mother,\\\"' said Joseph, \\\"it is I who should sue for pardon. My heart, is wild and stubborn; but I believe that it beats with a love as true, and warm for my empress as that of any other man in Austria. Have, patience with me, then, my mother, for I am indeed a wandering bird;, and, in my wild flight, the shafts of this life have wounded and maimed, me. But let us not speak of life--mine is a blasted one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very true, Gunther, but I cannot invite the Muses into my study. A, prince has no right to associate with such frivolous ladies, for he is, not on earth to pass away time. The King of Prussia heads a royal sect, who devote themselves to authorship. The Empress of Russia follows after, him with Voltaire in her hand. I cannot emulate their literary, greatness. I read to learn, and travel to enlarge my ideas; and I, flatter myself that as I encourage men of letters, I do them a greater, service than I would, were I to sit at a desk and help them to weave, sonnets. [Footnote: The emperor's own words. \\\"Letters of Joseph,\\\" p., 67.] So let us eschew Apollo and his light-footed companions; I aim to, be nothing but an imperial statesman. But,\\\" continued the emperor\\n\\nPotemkin, without any appearance of surprise, took it and broke the, seal. The king began by saying that he had every reason to believe that, the object of Joseph's visit to Russia was to alienate Russia from her, old ally. Then he went jnto ecstasies over the genius and statesmanship, of Potemkin, and besought him to uphold the interests of Prussia., Furthermore he promised his interest and influence to the prince, not, only for the present, but for the future, when it was probable that he, (Frederick) could serve Potemkin substantially. [Footnote: This letter, is historical, and is to be found in Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i., p. 412.]\\n\\nIn vain her confessor and her attendants strove to awaken her interest, to the dissatisfaction of the people with the wild projects of reform, that threatened the subversion of all social order. From the day of her, retirement, Maria Theresa had forbidden the slightest allusion to, politics. Her confesser had on one occasion ventured a hint on the, subject of the changes which were being made by the emperor, but the, empress had turned her flashing eyes upon him, and had reminded him, that, as the servant of the Lord, he was there to exhort and to pray\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty has given orders, that as soon as the event, which is, about to take place, has occurred, the whole court shall leave, Versailles for Choisy. Now it would not be possible to issue verbal, orders in such a moment as the one which we await; so that the master of, the horse and myself had agreed upon a signal by which the matter could, be arranged without speech. The garden du corps, pages, equerries\\n\\nWhenever Joseph awaked from his fever-dreams and unclosed his eyes, there, close to his bedside he saw the empress, who greeted him with, loving words and softest caresses. Whenever, in his fever-thirst, he, called for drink, her hand held the cup to his parched lips; and, whenever that soft, cool hand was laid upon his hot brow, he felt as if, its touch chased away all pain and soothed all sorrow.\\n\\nNot with his usual stateliness, but panting, almost running, did Kaunitz, traverse the gilded halls of his own palace, which were open to-day in, honor of the empress's recovery, and were already festive with the sound, of the guests assembling to a magnificent dinner which was to celebrate, the event. Without a word to the Countess Clary, who came forward, elegantly attired for the occasion, Kaunitz flew to his study, and, sinking into an arm-chair, he covered his face with his hands. He felt, as if he had been face to face with death. That was not his beautiful\\n\\nA breathless silence followed these bitter words. The emperor, in, confusion, withdrew behind the harpsichord. The archduke looked, perfectly indifferent. While Count Bathiany had been repeating his, words, his face had slightly flushed; but when he heard the sharp, reproof of his mother, he raised his head, and gave her back another, defiant look. With the same sullen haughtiness, he stared first at one, accuser, and then at another, while each one in his turn gave judgment, against him. First, and most vehement in his denunciations, was Count, Bartenstein. He denounced the archduke as idle and inattentive. He never, would have any political sagacity whatever. Why, even the great work, in, fifteen folios, which he (Count Bartenstein) had compiled from the, imperial archives for the especial instruction of the prince, even THAT, failed to interest him! [Footnote: Hormayer says that this book was, heavy and filled with tiresome details. (No wonder! In fifteen, folios.--Trane.)]\\n\\nA half year had passed away. The deputation from the Netherlands had, visited Vienna, and had been deeply impressed with the affability of the, emperor. They returned home, taking with them his assurance that their, time-honored usages should be respected, and that Joseph himself would be, the guardian of their ancient rights. He merely desired to free them, from \\\"certain abuses which in the lapse of time had crept into their, constitution.\\\" To this end he promised that an imperial delegation, should visit Brussels to consult with the states.\\n\\nPodstadsky, of course, was assailed with questions in relation to the, countess. He had known her in Italy as the wife of a wealthy old, nobleman to whom her parents had sacrificed her before she was eighteen., She had been sincerely admired in Rome, not only on account of her, beauty, but of her wit, goodness, and above all of her admirable, behavior toward her repulsive old husband. Her conduct had been so, exemplary that she had been called \\\"La contessa del cuore freddo.\\\", [Footnote: The countess with the cold heart.] Podstadsky confessed that, even he had been desperately in love with her, but finding her, unapproachable, had left Rome in despair. What then was his delight, when, a few moments ago, he had learned from her own lips that she was a, widow, and had come to spend a season in Vienna!\\n\\n\\\"Never! Austria cannot indulge such vain hopes, for her watchful spies, must ere this have convinced the Hapsburgs that my dislike toward this, duke, so precious in the eyes of Maria Theresa, is unconquerable. My, father's shade banished him to Chanteloup, and I will follow this shade, whithersoever it leads. If my father had lived (and perchance Choiseul, had a hand in his death) there would have been no alliance of France, with Austria. I am forced to maintain it, since my wife is the daughter, of Maria Theresa; so that neither the Austrian nor the anti-Austrian, party can ever hope to rule in France. Marie Antoinette is the wife of, my heart, and no human being shall ever dislodge her thence. But my love, for her can never influence my policy, which is steadfast to the, principles of my father. If Joseph has come hither for political, purposes, he might have spared his pains.\\\"\\n\\nThe festivities of the first day were concluded with a ballet. Great, preparations had been made for the reception of the King of Prussia., Noverre with his dancers, and Florian Gassman with his opera corps had, been summoned to Neustadt. They came in twenty wagons laden with, scenery, coulisses, machinery, and costumes, all of which was intended, to prove to Frederick that, although the court of Berlin was the, acknowledged seat of literature and the fine arts, Vienna was not, altogether forsaken by the Muses.\\n\\nLouis appeared to have no greater happiness than that which he found in, his wife's society. They were often seen wandering in the shady walks of, the palace gardens, talking, jesting, and laughing together, as might, have done any other young couple, unencumbered by the burden of royalty., It had even happened to Louis to steal an arm around the graceful form, of the queen, and once or twice to bestow a shy kiss upon her ivory, shoulders.\\n\\n\\\"Is that your sorrow, my child?\\\" exclaimed the empress. \\\"Joseph is like, his father; he loves wealth. The emperor had proposed this half-brother, of the King of Sardinia for you, Christina, but I refused my consent;, and, now without my knowledge, Joseph would force him upon you, because, of his great riches. But patience, patience, my daughter. I will show, you that I am not so powerless as you think; I will show you that no one, in Austria shall give away my Christina without her mother's, approbation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is with feelings of profound regret that I find myself forced to, decline your majesty's most friendly offers of mediation with Turkey. I, am obliged to unsheathe my sword, and I shall not return it to the, scabbard until it shall have won full reparation for all the wrongs, sustained by my forefathers at the hands of the Porte. Your majesty is a, monarch, and as such, you are acquainted with the rights of kings. And, is this undertaking of mine against Turkey any thing more than an, attempt to resume the rights of which my throne has been dispossessed?\\n\\nLacy bowed, and followed the grand duke in silence. The emperor, retreated to his cabinet, and, sinking upon a sofa, buried his face in, his hands. Nothing interrupted the stillness save the measured footsteps, of Lacy and the grand duke, who entered and closed the door behind them., A long pause ensued. The grand duke retired to a window, where, with his, arms folded, he awaited the development of affairs with recovered, composure. Joseph still sat with his face hidden by his hands, while, Lacy with military decorum stood at the door with his letters, silent, until the emperor should signify that he might read. Finding that Joseph, would not speak, Lacy took a few steps forward. \\\"Does your majesty allow, me to read the letters which, in the name of the empress, his imperial, highness, the grand duke, has delivered to me?\\\"\\n\\nI shall give it; but I think that my Maker will not love me the less for, having, voluntarily, felt the pangs of hunger for once in my life. I can, never forget this day in Bohemia; it has confirmed my resolution to, reign for the good of my people alone, and as God hears me, they shall, be happy when I govern them.--But your chicken is ready. To satisfy, you, I will go and beg my supper in yonder village, and, as there are, enough of you to attend to these poor sufferers, I will take Lacy to, keep me company. Come, Lacy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They deserve nothing better,\\\" replied Kaunitz, with his usual phlegm., \\\"They are thankless children whom he can win who feeds them with sugar., Your majesty, perhaps, has not sufficiently conciliated their weakness., You have been too honest in your opposition to their rotten privileges., Had you undermined the Joycuse Entree by degrees, it would have fallen, of itself. But you have attempted to blow it up, and the result is that, these Belgian children cry out that the temple of liberty is on fire\\n\\nIT was the hour of dinner. Complete silence reigned throughout the, imperial palace, except in the halls and stairways that led from the, imperial dining-hall to the kitchens below. Both lay far from the, apartments of the empress-abbess. She, therefore, felt that she could, visit her child without fear of observation. She had just concluded her, own solitary dinner, and was trying to collect her thoughts for prayer., In vain. They WOULD wander to the sick-bed of her daughter, whom fancy, pictured dying without the precious cares that a mother's hand alone is, gifted to bestow. Maria Theresa felt that her heart was all too, storm-tossed for prayer. She closed her book with a pang of, self-reproach, and rose from her arm-chair.\\n\\n\\\"Sire,\\\" said Kaunitz, proudly, \\\"there may be times when it is the part, of wisdom to be silent; but it is never permitted to a man of honor to, be untruthful. I know nothing of this girl's disappearance. The most, that I anticipated was a forced marriage. This, I knew, would occasion, new differences between the empress and your majesty, and I had supposed, that you were coming to me to call for my mediation.\\\"\\n\\nIt was dusk, and Giuseppe, with a travelling carriage, once more awaited, his mistress at the corner of the street. There remained nothing to do, now but to remove the coffer from its hiding-place, and that was the, work of half an hour. Arabella had the key of the little postern, and, there was no danger of spies, for the house was empty. Having avowed, herself to be the pensioned mistress of Podstadsky, the law had placed, its seal upon her effects, and they were all to be sold for the benefit, of the count's creditors.\\n\\nFor a few days past, the Archduchess Christina had absented herself from, this mournful levee. On the first day of her nonappearance the empress, had not appeared to remark her absence. But on the second day her eyes, wandered sadly from her prayer book to her children, and her lips seemed, ready to frame some question. Instead of speaking, she bent her head, over her rosary, and strove to pray with more devotion than usual.\\n\\n\\\"I do not know, your majesty. Accordng to your imperial command I, accompanied her highness to the chapel. I went as far as the stairway, that leads to the crypts. Her highness was strangely agitated. I tried, to soothe her, but as she looked below, and saw the open door, she, shuddered, and clinging to me, whispered: 'Countess, I scent the, loathesome corpse that even now stirs in its coffin at my approach.', Again I strove to comfort her, but all in vain. Scarcely able to support, herself, she bade me farewell, and commended herself to your majesty., Then, clinging to the damp walls, she tottered below, and disappeared.\\\"\\n\\nThe countess had just emerged from her dressing-room. Her dress for the, evening was of white satin, and the coronal of brilliants which flashed, among the braids of her black hair was worthy to be the bridal-diadem of, a queen. The Countess Baillou was tall and stately in her beauty, hers, was the fascination of the dark-eyed Italian, united to the majesty of a, daughter of ancient Rome, and the union was irresistible. Her throat was, slender, her head small, and her classic oval face was of a pale, pearly, hue, without a tinge of the rose, which, while it lends animation to a, woman's face, detracts from the camelia-like purity of genuine patrician, beauty.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, sir,\\\" said she, \\\"you have been true to your word. I was so afraid, you would forget me, that I was several times on the point of leaving, this grand place. I feel lonely and ashamed; for you see that no one is, here but myself. Nobody trusts the emperor. And I, who am here, will, surely be repulsed; he never will be as kind as you have been to a poor, friendless girl. My mother has no hope; and if she has sent me to the, palace, it was that I might see you again, and once more pour forth my, gratitude for your kindness. If you would add another to the generous, gift you have already bestowed, tell me your name, that my mother and I, may beg God's blessing upon it, and then let me go, for I feel that my, visit here will be vain!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" interrupted Maria Theresa, impetuously, \\\"yes, it is true. The, arrogance of these royal traders has provoked me beyond all bearing. I, will no longer permit them to insinuate of my own imperial rights that I, hold them as favors from the hand of any earthly power. It chafes the, pride of an empress-queen to be CALLED a friend and TREATED as a vassal;, and I intend that these proud allies shall feel that I resent their, affronts!\\\"\\n\\nyou would find that he is generous and ready to do justice to all men., Go home and write your petition; and come to-day at noon to the imperial, palace. The guards will allow you to pass, and a servant will be there, to conduct you to me. I, myself, will present your petition, and I know, that the emperor will not refuse a pension to the widow and child of a, brave Austrian officer.\\\"\\n\\nAt this moment Joseph heard the sounds of weeping. Turning, he beheld, coming toward him a young girl of about sixteen, whose slight figure, in, spite of the cool autumn day, was scarcely covered by a thin, patched, dress of dark stuff. An old, faded silk handkerchief was thrown over her, shoulders; her sweet, pale face was bedewed with tears, and her lips, were murmuring gentle complaints, though no one stopped to listen. On, her right arm she carried a bundle, which every now and then she, watched, as if afraid that some one might rob her of its treasures.\\n\\n\\\"Stop a moment,\\\" cried Maria Theresa. \\\"As you have been the instigator, of this thing, upon your shoulders shall fall the work that must arise, from it. I exact of you, therefore, to superintend the inoculation of my, subjects, and your pay as chief medical inspector shall be five thousand, florins. I also give my palace at Hetzendorf as a model hospital for the, reception of the children of fifty families, who shall there be, inoculated and cared for at my expense. This is the monument I shall, erect to my beloved Josepha; and when the little ones who are rescued, from death thank God for their recovery, they will pray for my poor, child's departed soul. Does this please you, my son?\\\"\\n\\nIt was long past midnight; but the Hotel Esterhazy was one blaze of, light. It had been one of the countess's first orders to her steward, that, at dusk, every chandelier in her palace should be lighted. She, hated night and darkness, she said, and must have hundreds of wax-lights, burning from twilight until morning. This was one of the whims of the, fair Margaret, which, although it amused all Vienna, was any thing but, comic to her husband, for it cost him one thousand florins a month.\\n\\nThis gave her courage. But she must have rest after her fearful, pilgrimage through that dark, empty house. She sank upon her satin, lounge, and abandoned herself to the joy and security of the hour. She, had just come to the end of a perilous journey. Night and danger were, behind, the rosy morning of safety was about to dawn. She was so full of, joyous emotion, that scarcely knowing what she did, her lips began to, move in unconscious prayer!\\n\\nat another the darkest and most flashing brown. Her bold profile, betokened great pride; but every look of haughtiness was softened away, by the enchanting expression of a mouth in whose exquisite beauty no, trace of the so-called \\\"Austrian lip\\\" could be seen. Her figure, loftier, than is usual with women, was of faultless symmetry, while her graceful, bust would have seemed to the eyes of Praxiteles the waking to life of, his own dreams of Juno.\\n\\n\\\"And the grand duke has accomplices, Catharine. Not one, nor two--but, half of your subjects mutter within themselves that the crown you wear, has been Paul's since his majority. Russia is one grand conspiracy, against you, and your enemies have pitched their tents at the foot of, your throne. They may well hate the only man who stands between you and, destruction. Their arrows have glanced harmlessly from the adamantine, shield of his loyalty, and there remained but the alternative of, calumniating him to his empress. Oh, Catharine, my angel; beware of, Paul, who has never forgotten how his father lost his life! Beware of, Orloff, who has never forgiven you for loving me! Both these traitors\\n\\n\\\"I am aware,\\\" replied the emperor graciously, \\\"that I was not expected;, but as this is the last day of our son's residence under the parental, roof, I am sure that my wife will see nothing strange in my visit. I was, with the archduke when your majesty's message reached him, and knowing, that you could have no secrets with the son which the father might not, hear, I followed the impulse of my affection, and came with him.\\\"\\n\\nwhat would become of Austria if I were not by, to keep him within, bounds? It will task all my genius to steer between the Scylla of a, bigoted, peace-loving empress, and the Charybdis of this reckless, emperor; to reconcile their antagonisms, and overrule their prejudices., Maria Theresa is for peace and a treaty with the Porte, who has lately, been a good-natured, harmless neighbor--Joseph thirsts for war that he, may enlarge his dominions and parade himself before the world as a, military genius. If his mother were to die to-morrow, he would plunge, headlong into a war with Russia or Turkey, whichever one he might happen, to fancy. I am obliged to hold this prospect forever before his eyes to, keep him quiet. I must also pay my tribute to the whims of the reigning, empress; and if we declare war to pacify Joseph, we must also make it, appear to Maria Theresa that war is inevitable.\\\"\\n\\nGunther bowed, and prepared to obey. The others went on with their work., Had Joseph not been so blinded by indignation against his private, secretary, he might have seen how one of the others raised his head and, glanced furtively around; how his face was pale, and his lips were, twitching; and how his hand was so tremulous that he was scarcely able, to hold his pen. No one observed it. The other secretaries were writing;, the emperor, in his wrath, saw nothing but Gunther.\\n\\nNot a smile was seen upon those appalled faces; men whispered to one, another that the count was the only son of one of the proudest families, in Hungary; and that the countess, his mother, had died of her son's, shame. The eyes of the women filled with tears, and, for the sake of the, martyred mother, they forgave the guilty son. The weeping of the women, deepened the sympathies of the men; and they began to murmur against the, heartless emperor, who degraded an illustrious subject, and sent a noble, countess broken-hearted to the grave!\\n\\n\\\"What! To exasperate the crowd! To endanger yourself, and drive these, poor, half-frantic creatures to desperation! Oh, by the love you bear us, all, I beseech you, have mercy upon those whose only possession on earth, is oftentimes the grave! You would deprive their children of the only, comfort left them--that of praying over the ashes of the departed. You, would deprive those who are condemned to live like brutes, of the, comfort of dying like men. You would have their bodies sewed in sacks, and thrown into ditches where they are not even allowed to moulder, but, must be destroyed by lime. No tombstone permitted over their remains\\n\\n\\\"No, sire, we do not threaten; we are in the presence of a truth-loving, monarch, and we are compelled to speak the unvarnished truth. We have, already borne much from your majesty's ancestors. But, until the death, of Maria Theresa, our fundamental laws remained inviolate. True, in the, last years of her life she refused to allow the states-diet to assemble;, but she never laid her hand upon our constitution. She was crowned Queen, of Hungary, and took the coronation oath. Charles the Sixth and Joseph, the First did likewise. Each one guaranteed us the right of inheritance\\n\\nFrom these painful and humiliating retrospections, the emperor's, thoughts wandered to the beautiful being, who, like a hamadryad, had, blended her life with the tree of Polish liberty. He thought of that, face whose pallid splendor reminded him of the glories of waning day;, and he listened through the long, dim aisles of memory, to the sound of, that enchanting voice, whose melody had won his heart long ago on that, first, happy evening at Neustadt.\\n\\nand forced submission to the requirements of court etiquette, soared, high into regions of exultant happiness. His countenance, once so cold, and impassible, was now full of joyous changes; his eyes, once so dull, and weary, glowed with the fire of awakened enthusiasm, and they looked, so brilliant a blue, that it seemed as if some little ray from heaven, had found its way into their clear, bright depths. The poor boy was an, altered creature. He was frolicsome with his friends; and as for those, whom he considered his enemies, he cared nothing for their likes or, dislikes. He had nothing to lose or gain from them; he was to leave the, court, leave Vienna, leave every troublesome remembrance behind, and go\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur,\\\" said the duke to Andouille, the king's physician, \\\"I leave, you that you may be able to open and embalm the body.\\\" Andouille grew, pale, for he knew perfectly well that the performance of such a ceremony, as that, was his death-warrant. However, after a pause, he replied, \\\"I, am ready, your grace, but you must remain to hold the king's head. It, is, as you know, a part of your duty as gentleman of the bedchamber.\\\", [Footnote: Campan, vol. i., p. 79]\\n\\nAt court they spoke the language of the country; and Isabella--who with, her friends sang boleros and danced the cachuca; with her brother, read, Racine and Corneille--was equally happy while she hung enraptured upon, the strains of Pergolese's music, or gazed entranced upon the pictures, of Correggio and the Veronese. The princess herself was both a painter, and musician, and no one, more than she, loved Italy and Italian art.\\n\\nJoseph raised his head from the coffin, and stared wildly around. He saw, the priests, the acolytes with their smoking censers, the weeping, attendants of his wife; he saw the black hangings, the groups of, mourners, and his father and mother standing pale and sad beside him; he, heard the tolling of the bells and the dull sound of the funeral drum;, and now, now indeed he felt the awful reality of his bereavement, and, knew that as yet he had suffered nothing. Tears filled his eyes, and he, sank upon his father's breast. Sobs and wailings filled the funeral, hall, while without the inexorable knell went on, the drums still beat\\n\\nWith a look of unspeakable affection Joseph gave his hand to Lacy., \\\"Lacy,\\\" said he, \\\"if I have made this great sacrifice to-day, it is, neither from conviction nor fear; it is to show you what influence your, words have over me, and to thank you for the manliness with which you, have ventured to blame my acts. Few princes possess the jewel of a, faithful friend. I thank God that this jewel is mine!\\\" [Footnote: The, burial edict was as follows: \\\"As the burial of the dead has for its, object the speedy dissolution of the body, and as nothing hinders that, dissolution more than the casing of the corpse in a coffin, it is, ordained that all dead bodies shall be stripped of their clothing, and, sewed up in a linen sack, laid in an open coffin, and brought to the, place of interment. A hole shall be dug six feet long and four feet, wide, and the corpse being taken out of the coffin, shall be put into, this grave, strewed plentifully with quick-lime, and covered with earth., If more than one corpse is to be buried, the bodies can all be put in, the same grave.\\\"--Gross-Hoffinger, \\\"History of the Life and Reign of, Joseph II.,\\\" vol. ii., p. 146.]\\n\\nExhausted from fasting and such long vigils, her head reeled, and she, staggered to her couch. A cold shudder crept over her limbs; all was, dark as night about her; she tried to clasp her hands in prayer and, could not, for they were numb and powerless. \\\"This is welcome death!\\\", thought she, and her lips parted with a happy smile. Her head fell, backward on the pillow, and her senses fled.\\n\\nwhich, since the days of Philip II., have ever been the nest of, rebellion and revolt. To this alliance, therefore, we owe it that your, majesty still reigns over those seditious provinces. To Savoy we are, indebted for Lombardy; while France, perfidious France, has not only, robbed us of our territory, but to this day asserts her right to its, possession! No, your majesty--so long as France retains that which, belongs to Austria, Austria will neither forgive her enmity nor forget, it. See, on the contrary, how the maritime powers have befriended us! It, was THEIR gold which enabled us first to withstand France, and afterward, Prussia--THEIR gold that filled your majesty's coffers--THEIR gold that, sustained and confirmed the prosperity of your majesty's dominions. This, is the alliance that I advocate, and with all my heart I vote for its, renewal. It is but just that the princes and rulers of the earth should, give example to the world of good faith in their dealings; for the, integrity of the sovereign is a pledge to all nations of the integrity, of his people.\\\"\\n\\nSince his arrival in the capital, Joseph had been the theme of every, conversation. Every one had something to relate of his affability, his, condescension, or his goodness. His bon mots, too, were in every mouth;, and the Parisians, who at every epoch have been so addicted to wit, were, so much the more enraptured with the impromptu good things which fell, from Joseph's lips, that the Bourbons were entirely deficient in, sprightliness.\\n\\nWhen the nuncio had read thus far, he paused and raised his eyes to the, face of the empress. It was very pale and agitated, while the, countenance of the emperor, on the contrary, was flushed with triumph., Joseph tried to meet the glance of Prince Kaunitz's eye, but it was, blank as ever; sometimes fixed vacantly upon the nuncio, and then, turning with cold indifference toward the speaking countenances of the, devoted friend and inveterate enemy of the Order of Jesus.\\n\\n\\\"Free not only from others, but from me also,\\\" said the emperor, deeply, affected. \\\"I feel I have erred toward this innocent young girl. I have, deeply sinned; for, regardless of her peace of mind, I have allowed, myself to dream of a love that could bring naught and misery to both., For I will not conceal from you, my friend, how much it costs me to, renounce this sweet creature, and to promise that I will see her no, more. My intercourse with her was the last dying sigh of a love which, has gone from my heart forevermore. But--it must be sacrificed. Rescue, her, and try to make her happy, Kaunitz; try to efface from her heart, the memory of my blasting love.\\\"\\n\\nlo! he ran and hid himself under my mother's petticoats; and the two old, crowns fell foul of one another, and their palsied old wearers plotted, together, until the great war upon which I had staked my fame was, juggled into a shower of carnival confetti! Oh, you laugh at me, and, well may you laugh! I am a fool to waste so much enthusiasm upon such a, fool's holiday!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has your majesty any complaint to make of me as minister, or as, president of council?\\\" asked Kaunitz, almost roughly. \\\"Have I not, fulfilled the vows I made to your majesty ten years ago? Have I, discharged my duties carelessly? The ship of state which, in her hour of, peril, was confided to my hands, have I not steered her safely through, rocks and reefs? Or, have I been unfaithful to my trust? If your majesty, can convict me of crime, or even of negligence, then sit in judgment, upon the culprit. Tell me of what state offence am I accused?\\\"\\n\\nJoseph bent eagerly forward. He knew those strains so well! He, remembered the night when Isabella's tears had fallen among the, rose-leaves, and he had kissed them away. He saw her once more in the, pride of her beauty, looking at him from the depths of those glorious, dark eyes which he had so madly loved. The music gave life and being to, these memories, and its glamour brought back the dead from her grave! He, remembered how he had asked her if she loved him, and how, avoiding the, words so difficult to speak, she had answered with the witching tones of, her violin. Oh, that heavenly evening hour upon the balcony! She had, said, \\\"Love has its own language: come and listen.\\\" And Christina said, SHE HAD NOT LOVED! He could not, would not believe her!\\n\\nKaunitz looked at the emperor and slightly raised his finger by way of, warning. \\\"The King of Prussia,\\\" said he, \\\"is no longer the hero that he, was in years gone by; he dare not risk his fame by giving battle to the, emperor. He rests upon his laurels, plays on the flute, writes bad, verses, and listens to the adulation of his fawning philosophical, friends. Then why should he molest us in Bavaria. We have documents to, prove that the heritage is ours, and if we recognize his right to, Bayreuth and Anspach, he will admit ours to whatever we choose to, claim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh my father and my sovereign,\\\" said he in a voice that trembled with, emotion, \\\"my whole life will not be long enough to thank you for what, yon are doing for me in this critical hour. Till now I have loved you, indeed as my father, but henceforth I must look upon you as my, benefactor also, as my dearest and best friend. My heart and my soul are, yours, dear father; may I be worthy of your love and of the sacrifice, you are making for me to-day!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It appears to me that my son has no reason to lament the softness of, his own heart,\\\" replied Maria Theresa, bitterly. \\\"If he were absolute, sovereign here, the Jesuits would be exiled to-morrow; and the King of, Prussia, for whom he entertains such unbounded admiration, would be the, first one to offer them shelter. I will answer your vituperation, my, son, by reading to you a letter written by Frederick to his agent in, Rome. It relates to the rumor now afloat that the pope is about to, disperse the holy brotherhood. I have just received a copy of it from, Italy, and it rejoices me to be able to lay it before you. Hear your, demi-god.\\\"\\n\\nThe enraptured audience again forgot her eyes, and, entranced by the, music, hung breathless upon her notes, while she executed the, magnificent funeral march in \\\"OEdipus.\\\" Suddenly, at the conclusion of a, passage of exquisite beauty, she ceased, and her hands wandered feebly, over the keys, Her father, who was turning the leaves, looked almost, scornfully at the poor girl; who, alarmed and bewildered by his, unaccountable conduct, grew deadly pale, and finally, with a deep sigh\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" said she, with a disappointed look, \\\"this is no private letter. It, is nothing but a letter of instructions, directing me how to win the, king's confidence, so as to influence his policy and secure a new ally, to Austria. The empress need not remind me that I must look to the, interests of the house of Hapsburg. The Queen of France will never, forget that she is the daughter of Maria Theresa, and she will do all in, her power to promote an alliance between France and Austria. Tell my, mother that I never will cease to be her subject, and that her interests, shall always be mine. And now for the other mission.\\\"\\n\\ncertainly, does too little. I hear everywhere of interdicts, but nowhere, of concessions. Old things destroyed, but nothing created to replace, them. What will be the result of this? Austria must soon be reduced to a, mass of ruins, and your son will go down to posterity with a fame like, that of Attila. Save Austria! save him from the curse that threatens, both. We have not yet completed the noble edifice of which eleven years, ago we laid the foundations. We must finish the structure, and so solid, must be its walls that our thoughtless young reformer shall not have, strength to batter them down. Your majesty must remain the reigning, Empress of Austria. You cannot resign your empire to your son. Duty and, the welfare of your subjects forbid it.\\\"\\n\\ndropped a long white mantle over the shoulders of the ministerial, coxcomb. Is light folds closed around him, and, with an Olympian nod, he, turned toward the door, while the valet flew to open it. As soon as the, count appeared, the other valets, who, with the hair-dresser, stood on, either side of the room, raised each one a long brush dipped in, hair-powder, and waved it to and fro. Clouds of white dust filled the, room; while through the mist, with grave and deliberate gait, walked, Kaunitz, every now and then halting, when the brushes all stopped; then, giving the word of command, they all fell vigorously to work again. Four, times he went through the farce, and then, grave as a ghost, walked back, to his dressing-room, followed by the hair-dresser.\\n\\nOther humiliations besides this had been endured by the head of the, church. Perhaps in the two solemn benedictions which he had given--the, first in the palace-court, the second in the cathedral, Pius had hoped, to appear in public with the emperor as his spiritual vassal; but Joseph, was careful not to allow him this gratification. He had no sooner, learned that the throne of the pope in the cathedral was being erected, higher than his own, than he ordered the imperial throne to be removed\\n\\n\\\"and we, who require so much for our comfort, are poorer than they. But, as there is no help for our poverty, let us think of dinner. Here are, three streets; the village seems to have been divided for our especial, accommodation. Each one shall take a street, and in one hour from now we, meet at the carriage, each man with a dish of contribution. En avant! I, take the street before me; you do the same. Look at your watches, and be, punctual.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and you have silenced them with your cold arguments. The empress has, heard, and she it is who must decide against herself. She has no right, to sacrifice her empire to her maternity. May God forgive me,\\\" continued, she, solemnly clasping her hands, \\\"if I err in quelling the voice of my, love which cries so loudly against this union. Let it be accomplished!, Marie Antoinette shall be the bride of Louis XVI.\\\"\\n\\nShe crossed the room and stood before a Psyche, where for some time she, scrutinized her own features; not with the self-complacency of a vain, woman, but with the critical acuteness of an artist who contemplates a, fine picture. Gradually her eyes grew soft and her mouth rippled with a, smile. Like a mourning Juno she stood in the long black velvet dress, that sharply defined the outlines of her faultless bust and fell in, graceful folds around her stately figure. Her bodice was clasped by an, agrafe of richest pearls; and the white throat and the jewel lay, together, pearl beside pearl, each rivalling the snowy lustre of the, other. Had it not been for those starry eyes that looked out so full of, mournful splendor, her face might have seemed too statuesque in its, beauty; but from their dark depths all the enthusiasm of a nature that, had concentrated its every emotion into one master-passion, lit up her, face with flashes that came and went like summer lightning.\\n\\n\\\"I see it, I see it,\\\" cried Joseph, passionately, \\\"but I cannot take, it--I cannot play my part in this mockery of a return. No, mother, no, I, cannot kiss the hand that has so cruelly dashed my hopes to earth. And, you wish to carry your tyranny so far as to exact that I receive it with, a smile? Oh, mother, my heart is breaking! Have pity on me, and take, back those cruel words; let me go, let me go. Do not make me a byword, for the world, that hereafter will refuse me its respect. Let me go, if, but for a few weeks, and on the day that you command my return, I will, come home. Oh, my heart was too small to hold the love I bore you for, your consent to my departure. It seemed to me that I had lust begun to, live; the world was full of beauty, and I forgot all the trials of my, childhood. For one week I have been young, dear mother; hurl me not back, again into that dark dungeon of solitude where so much of my short life, has been spent. Do not condemn me to live as I have hitherto lived; give, me freedom, give me my manhood's rights!\\\"\\n\\ndesert the old style, to follow these new-fangled musical, eccentricities? Have we not all enjoyed the opera as it exists at, present? And if so, why shall this Master Gluck step suddenly forward, and announce to us that we know nothing of music, and that what we have, hitherto admired as such was nothing more than trumpery? Why does he, disdain the poetry of Metastasio, to adopt that of a man whom nobody, knows? I will not lend my hand to mortify the old man who for thirty, years has been our court-poet. I owe it to him, at least, not to appear, at this representation, and that is reason enough for me to refuse my, presence there.\\\"\\n\\nHe was inclining his head, when a wrest, of red roses and, orange-flowers, aimed by some skilful hand, fell directly upon his, saddle-bow. He smiled, and taking up the wreath, looked around to see, whence it came. Suddenly his eye brightened, and his countenance, expressed increased interest, while he reined in his horse that he might, look again at a lady who was leaning over a balcony just above him. Her, tall and elegant figure was clothed in a dress of black velvet, closed, from her white throat to her round waist by buttons of large and, magnificent diamonds, whose brilliancy was almost dazzling. Her youthful, and beautiful face was colorless, with that exquisite and delicate, pallor which has no affinity to ill-health, but resembles the spiritual, beauty of a marble statue. Her glossy black hair defined the exquisite, oval of that fair face, as a rich frame sets off a fine painting. On her, head she wore a diadem of brilliants, which confined a rich black-lace, veil, that fluttered like a dark cloud around her graceful figure. Her, countenance wore an expression of profound sadness, and her large\\n\\n\\\"I shall take the liberty of going in without awaiting an invitation,\\\", said the emperor, pushing open the door and entering the cottage. But he, started at the unexpected sight that met his view as he looked around, the room. It was a miserable place, cold and bare; not a chair or any, other article of household furniture was to be seen; but in the centre, of the room stood a small deal coffin, and in the coffin was the corpse, of a child. Stiff and cold, beautiful and tranquil, lay the babe, a, smile still lingering around its mouth, while its half-open eyes seemed, fixed upon the white roses that were clasped in its little dimpled, hands. The coffin lay in the midst of flowers, and within slept the dead, child, transfigured and glorified.\\n\\n\\\"I had last night a singular vision,\\\" she said. \\\"The spirit of my mother, appeared to me, and said that in three days I was to die. I believe in, this vision. Do not weep, dear sisters; I go to eternal rest. Life is, bitter, death is sweet. Pray for me, that my mother's prophetic words be, verified; and you, beloved friend of that mother,\\\" added she, kissing, the cameriera's cheek, \\\"you who know the depths of my heart, and its, secret, silent agony, pray for your child, and praying, ask of her, heavenly Father--death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My memory does not cling to dates, Theresa,\\\" replied the emperor., \\\"What, if to-day be accidentally the anniversary of our marriage? With, every beating of my heart, I celebrate the hour itself, when I won the, proud and beautiful heiress of Austria; and when I remember that she, deigned to love ME, the poor Archduke of Lorraine, my happiness, overwhelms me. Come, then, my beautiful, my beloved Theresa; come to my, heart, that I may thank you for all the blessings that I owe to your, love. See, dearest, we are alone; let us forget royalty for to-day, and, be happy together in all the fulness of mutual confidence and, affection.\\\"\\n\\nThe royal equipage had now reached the gates, and was passing into the, country. Marie Antoinette felt a sense of relief at the change. She, gazed with rapture upon the rich foliage of the trees, and then looking, pensively above for a few moments, she watched the floating clouds of, blue and silver, and then followed the flight of the birds that were, soaring in such freedom through the air.\\n\\na perfect fortune, lay at my feet; I moved my train to cover it, and, signed to Carlo, who, I must say, was always within call. He invited the, princess to dance, and--the pearls found their way to my pocket. What a, talk that loss made in Vienna! What offers of reward that poor woman, made to recover her necklace! All in vain, and nobody condoled more, affectionately with her than the charming, kind-hearted Countess, Baillou. This sorrow--but, pshaw! what a child I am, to be gloating over, my precious toys while time passes away, and I must be off to-night!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You did, indeed, give me a generous pension,\\\" replied Bundener, \\\"and, may God bless your majesty, for a more bountiful sovereign never bore, the weight of a crown. But desolation and despair sit in the places, where once your majesty's name was mingled each day with the prayers of, those whom you had succored. The emperor has withdrawn every pension, bestowed by you. He has received a statement of every annuity paid by, your majesty's orders, and has declared his intention of cleaning out, the Augean stables of this wasteful beneficence.\\\" [Footnote: Hubner\\n\\nwas decked to receive some great and distinguished guest. A rich carpet, covered the floor, flowers bloomed in costly vases, the piano was, opened, and the music on the stand showed that the countess still found, consolation in her genius. But she herself was strangely altered since, the day on which she had thrown her bouquet to the emperor in Neustadt., Nevertheless she wore the same dress of black velvet, the same jewels\\n\\nIrritable, crabbed, and low-spirited, his campaign had proved a, disastrous failure. Instead of planning battles, he had planned, pillaging and foraging expeditions, and his hungry and disaffected army, had converted the rich fields of Bohemia into a gloomy and desolate, waste. At last succoring winter came to the help of the oppressed, Bohemians, and both armies went into winter quarters. Maria Theresa had, employed the season, which forced her ambitious son to inactivity, in, new negotiations for peace. Count von Mercy had sought for intervention, on the part of France, and Baron Thugut had made new proposals to, Prussia. Until to-day the empress had indulged the hope of terminating, this unhappy and ridiculous war; but her hopes had been frustrated by, the dispatches she had just received from France and Bohemia. Count von, Mercy wrote that so far from accepting the role of mediator, the French, king expostulated with him upon the injustice of the claims of Austria\\n\\nIsabella said nothing. She had held up before her face the bouquet which, her husband had gathered for her, that her tears might fall unseen among, its flowers. Joseph saw those tears shining like dew-drops upon its, rose-leaves, and, taking it from her hands, he kissed them away. \\\"Do not, weep, my Isabella,\\\" whispered he tenderly; \\\"your tears fall like a, weight of sorrow upon my heart. Wipe them away, beloved. The day will, come when you also shall be an empress, and your people will do you, homage as I do now; and then you will have it in your power to heal, their sorrows, and wipe away their tears; and they will love and bless, you as I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it will not maintain you as you live with your handsome, pension. But you need not starve. Be that as it may, there is a blind, countess who is my patient, for whom Von Stork is to obtain the pension, as soon as you can convince the faculty that your daughter is no longer, in need of it. This patient, I assure you, will receive it as long as, she lives, for it will never enter into her head to fancy that she has, been cured by Master Mesmer.\\\"\\n\\nand no one has the courage to come between her and her mania for, match-making. I then appealed to her majesty myself; but in vain. Her, only answer was this: 'You were to marry the count, or go into a, convent.' She added, that to-morrow every thing would be prepared in the, court chapel for your marriage; that she, herself, would honor you by, giving you away; and that, if you did not come punctually, when the, imperial state coach was sent for you, she would have you taken instead, to a convent.\\\"\\n\\nThe prince gave a shrug, and trifled with the papers he had brought with, him. \\\"We have bound ourselves,\\\" said he, reading here and there among, the leaves, \\\"to bring about a peace between Russia and Turkey, by which, the former shall restore to the latter all the provinces which she has, conquered from the Porte; or, if not all, those which are indispensable, to preserve the honor of Turkey intact. We have furthermore bound, ourselves to secure the independence of the Republic of Poland.\\\"\\n\\nHer uncle heard her sob, and following the impulse of his affection and, compassion, he opened the room, and came softly in. He called her, and, she raised her head. The light from the wax-candles that stood on the, harpsichord fell directly upon her face, which was bedewed with tears., Her uncle's entrance seemed neither to have surprised nor irritated her., With an expression of indescribable woe she merely murmured\\n\\nMonsieur Etienne surveyed his notes of preparation, and gave an, approving nod. His face was radiant as he returned to the house; gave, another glance of satisfaction around the dining-room, and passed into, an adjoining apartment. This was the best-furnished room in the, post-house; and on a soft lounge, near the window, reclined a pale, young woman, beautifully dressed, whose vicinity to a cradle, where lay, a very young infant, betokened her recent recovery from confinement.\\n\\n\\\"I hope that I have never strayed from the path of right. The object of, my life has been to make Austria great and independent, and to aid my, emperor in freeing his subjects from foreign dominion. To-day no earthly, potentate has a voice in Austria, save Joseph; he is absolute master, here, and as all his acts have been for Austria's good, she has entered, at last upon a career of indisputable prosperity. But there is nothing, wonderful in this, when he had me as a coadjutor.\\\"\\n\\nOn that day the number of her enemies was increased by more than a, hundred persons, who attacked her with tongues sharper than two-edged, swords. The first thrust was given her on the morning that followed the, reception; and the same people who a few days before had been singing, her praises on the Pont-neuf, were equally, if not better pleased with, the ballad of \\\"La Reine moqueuse,\\\" of which the cruel refrain was as, follows:\\n\\n\\\"Shut the door, and admit no one during the visit of Prince Kaunitz,\\\", said the king. Then turning to the prince, he pointed to his flute. \\\"I, suspect you are amused to see such an old fellow as I coquetting with, the fine arts; but I assure you that my flute is one of my trustiest, friends. She has never deceived me, and keeps my secrets faithfully. My, alliance with her is for life. Ask her, and she will tell you that we, live on terms of truest friendship.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do. She besought me in trembling tones to tell her something of her, beloved child--and I did nothing to tranquillize her, --for she has no, right to seclude herself from her people. Maria Theresa is a greater, sovereign than her son will ever be, and Austria cannot afford to lose, her now. She will visit her daughter to-day. Tell the archduchess not to, fear her brother's opposition; for her mother, once resolved to return, to her people, will see that her own daughters are not made wretched by, a tyrannical brother. The princess will marry her lover.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" cried the emperor, \\\"the time for deliberation has gone by. The, hour for decision has struck, and I am free to give battle. It is, Frederick who has thrown down the glove, and I too, shall emerge from, obscurity, and prove to the world that others besides the King of, Prussia are worthy to lead their men to victory. It would be, dishonorable to refuse the challenge he has sent through his invasion of, Bohemia. Let orders be given to march to Jaromirs. We shall await the, enemy there; and there at last I shall measure swords with the greatest, captain of the age!\\\"\\n\\nInto a silence that seemed so breathless and so long, that her father, arose, frightened, from his knees. He bent over his smiling child, and, her face seemed transfigured. Not a sigh stirred he, bosom, not a moan, fluttered from her lips. But that smile remained so long unchanged, and, her eyes--surely they were glazed! Yes!--Rachel was dead.

When I threatened, interference, the answer was this: 'We have resolved to dismember, Poland, and you shall not prevent us.' What, then, could I do? Declare, war? That were to ruin my people. Remain passive, while my enemies, enlarged their frontiers, so as to endanger my own? We then had recourse, to stratagem. We defended our soil inch by inch, and gave up when, resistance became fanaticism. We required for our share more than we, desired, hoping to be refused. But no! To my sorrow and disappointment\\n\\n\\\"I know what they want,\\\" murmured she. \\\"Joseph thirsts for glory and, conquest, and Kautnitz upholds him.

I shudder at the deed, and yet I cannot raise my hand without, shedding my people's blood. I must take counsel of Heaven!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To help your father in his projects of vengeance. You cannot conceive, how exultant I am when I see you surrounded by hosts of Christian, nobles, all doing homage to your beauty and your father's millions., Encourage them, Rachel, that they may become intoxicated with love, and, that on the day when they ask me for my daughter's hand, I may tell them, that my daughter is a Jewess, and can never be the wife of a Christian!\\\"\\n\\nIn the great reception-room of the imperial palace, a deputation of the, most illustrious magnates of Hungary awaited an interview with the, emperor. For one whole year the Hungarian nobles had withdrawn from, court; but now, in the interest of their fatherland, they stood once, more within the walls of the palace; and in their magnificent, state-uniforms, as the representatives of all Hungary, they were, assembled to demand redress for their national grievances.\\n\\n\\\"Treasures, indeed! They are part of the library of a convent. The, emperor has destroyed them as the Vandals once did the treasures of the, Goths. I bought them from one of our own people. And that is not all.

Then, let him justify his acts to us both, and prove that what he has done is, right. I have suffered such anguish of mind over the partition of, Poland, that Joseph would lift a load from my heart, if he could show me, that it is inevitable. My son, you have come for my signature. Before, God, your mother, and Poland herself, justify our deed, and I will sign, the act.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor looked sternly upon the unconscious hussar. \\\"Soldier,\\\" said, he, in loud and solemn tones, \\\"keep the gold I have given you in, remembrance of the warning which your good angel whispered, when you, forbore to murder the King of Prussia. I hope and believe that every man, among you would risk his life in battle to take him prisoner, but God, forbid that any one of you should stoop so low as to become his, murderer!\\\"\\n\\ntaking both her hands in his, pressed them passionately to his lips., \\\"Antoinette,\\\" said he, tenderly, \\\"you say that I do not love you. You, have not then read my heart, which, filled to bursting with love for my, beautiful wife, dared not ask for response, because I had been told that, you--you--but no--I will not pain you with repetition of the calumny., Enough that I am blessed with your love, and may at last be permitted to, pour out the torrent of mine! Antoinette, will you be my wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" sighed he, \\\"during three of these nights I might just as well have, slept in my bed as any respectable burgher who has nothing to trouble, him but his growing corpulence. But last night I dared not undress, for, I have much to do this morning. Good Heaven! Gunther,\\\" continued the, emperor, suddenly remembering the hussar, \\\"what has become of the man, whom I gave into your custody last evening?\\\"\\n\\nThe prince struggled to get free. \\\"You have disarranged my whole dress,\\\", said he, peevishly. \\\"On account of your folly I shall have to make my, toilet again. Hear me, and let me alone. I said that you would AFFECT to, be my mistress. To this end you will drive as usual to the side-door by, which you have been accustomed to enter the palace, and while your, carriage stands there for one hour, you shall be treated to a costly, breakfast in my little boudoir every morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" exclaimed she, \\\"the time went by four years ago. You can never, make amends to me, nor I to you. Look at yourself! You were then a young, man, with high hopes and a light heart. Many a woman would have been, proud to be called your wife--and yet you chose me. Now, that four years, of accursed wedded life have gone over your head, you have passed from, youth to old age, without ever having known an interval of manhood. And, I--O God! What have I become through your miserable cowardice! I might, have grown to be a gentle woman, had fate united me to him whom I love;, but the link that has bound me to you has unsexed me. Our marriage was a, crime, and we have paid its penalty; you are as weak as a woman, and, I--as inflexible as a man.\\\"\\n\\nsmiling. \\\"You will acknowledge that Russia is not always consistent; for, instance--in Poland, where she does not perceive the right of a noble, race of men to elect their own rulers, but forces upon them a king whom, they all despise. I must now declare to you that my sovereign will enter, into negotiations with Turkey on one condition only: that the, territorial rights of Poland be left untouched, not only by Russia, but, by any other European power!\\\" [Footnote: V. Dohm. \\\"Memoirs\\\" vol. i., p., 492.]\\n\\nbeautiful reality of our luxurious life is substantially before us. Away, with cowardice! He who treads the path which we have trodden, must cast, all fear behind him. Had we been scrupulous, or faint-hearted, you would, have been to-day a ruined nobleman, dependent upon the pittance doled, out to you from parental hands, or upon some little office pompously, bestowed by the emperor; and I--ha! ha!--I should have been a, psalm-chanting nun, with other drowsy nuns for my companions through, life, and a chance of dying in the odor of sanctity! We were too wise, for that; and now the structure of our fortunes is complete. Its gilded, dome reaches into the heaven of the most exclusive circles; princes\\n\\nwondering who it was that could add the weight of a sneer to the supreme, misery which was rending their hearts. It came from above; and every, face, even that of the wretched Podstadsky, as uplifted in horror. He, caught at the stake, and his vacant eyes rested upon the house whence, the cruel laugh had issued. There, on a balcony, guarded by several men, in black, stood a beautiful young woman. She it was who had dealt the, blow. In the hour of his agony her rosy lips had mocked him!\\n\\nHow changed, alas, was the high-born Carlo! How little this chattering, creature, disguised in serge, resembled the cavalier who had enlisted, the sympathy of the multitude! He was no longer a man, and name he had, none. His number, in scarlet list upon the left sleeve of his smock, was, the only mark that distinguished him from his brethren--the other, malefactors. But the fearful toilet was not yet at an end. The feet and, hands were yet to be manacled. As the handcuffs clicked around those, delicate wrists, the executioner looked up in amazement. Heretofore he, had been accustomed to hear the jeers and loud mockery of the multitude\\n\\nShe started, for she heard a sound near the side door. Now the key, turned in the lock, and in another moment the king walked in. He still, wore the magnificent Spanish court-dress in which he had received the, homage of his marriage guests. The order of the Golden Fleece was on his, breast, and also the sparkling diamond cross of the imperial house of, Hapsburg. Josepha, blushing, recalled to mind her night negligee, and, dared not raise her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I promise to free her, but I cannot promise to rescue her from the, memory of your majesty's love. Who knows that from the ring which she, has sworn to wear forever, she may not have inhaled a poison that will, shorten her young life? To rescue her from such a fate lies not in the, power of man. Time--the great comforter--may heal her wounds, but your, majesty must promise never to ask whither she has gone. For you she must, be dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In earnest!\\\" repeated Kaunitz, with a shrug. \\\"You statesman in, swaddling-clothes! You do not know the first principles of your, profession; and yet you have lived with me for thirty years! In, diplomacy there is no such thing as stability of policy. Policy shapes, itself according to circumstances, and changes as they change. The man, who attempted to follow fixed principles in international policy, would, soon find himself and his government on the verge of a precipice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, your majesty; in the name of every nobleman in Vienna, and, above, all, in the name of our noble ladies. I beseech of you grant us the, exclusive privilege of ONE garden, where we may meet, unmolested by the, rabble. Give us the use of the Prater, that we may have some spot in, Vienna where we can breathe the fresh air in the company of our equals, alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear child,\\\" said Joseph, laughing, \\\"if all the emperor's opponents, were as headstrong as you, the poor man would have but little hope of, ever gaining the good-will of his subjects. But I intend to prove to you, that you are unjust. Give me your petition. I myself will present it for, you. Wait awhile, until I send a messenger who will conduct you to the, emperor. Follow him and fear nothing, for I shall be there, too, and, there I will tell you my name. Au revoir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will--I promise to keep nothing from you.\\\" \\\"I promise the same to, you, and perhaps this plant of friendship may one day bear the flowers, of love. You are inexperienced in the ways of court-life. You will need, a pilot to steer you safe amid reefs and breakers. I will be this pilot, to you, I will teach you what to suspect and to avoid. Above all, never, venture to have an opinion that does not coincide with that of the, empress. We are all a pious and well-brought-up family who see with her, eyes, and hear with her ears, and never dare confess that we possess, sight or hearing in our own persons. Recollect that you, too, must fall, in the line of puppets, and give up your senses to the empress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! your majesty would remind me of that ridiculous affair with, Bavaria. It was my last Quixotism, the dying struggle of a patriotism, which would have made of Germany one powerful and prosperous nation! And, it was YOU who opposed me--YOU who, of all the potentates in Europe, are, the one who should have understood and sustained me! Believe me, when I, say, that had Catharine befriended me there, she would have won the, truest knight that ever broke a lance in defence of fair ladye. But, for, the sake of a dotard, who is forever trembling lest I rob him of some of, his withered bays, the bold Athene of the age forgot her godlike origin, and mission, and turned away from him whom she should have countenanced, and conciliated. Well! It was the error of a noble heart, unsuspicious, of fair words. And fair words enough had Frederick for the occasion. To, think of such a man as HE, flaunting the banner of Germany in my, face--he who, not many years ago, was under the ban of the empire as an, ambitious upstart! He thought to scare me with the rustling of his dead, laurel-leaves, and when he found that I laughed at such Chinese warfare\\n\\nHereupon he resumed his conversation with Noverre. The other guests, were indignant, for they all felt the insult. The nobles disapproved of, the fashion, which had been introduced by Kaunitz, of mingling artists, and savans of no birth with the aristocracy of Vienna; and the, ambassadors felt it as a personal injury that Kaunitz, who yesterday had, refused to wait for them, to-day called upon them to wait for a, musician.\\n\\nnot long since, saw fit to reprove the insolence of this same British, envoy, who in her very presence spoke of the Netherlands as though they, had been a boon to Austria from England's clemency. Incensed at the tone, of this representative of our friends, the empress exclaimed: 'Am I not, ruler in the Netherlands as well as in Vienna? Do I hold my right of, empire from England and Holland?'\\\" [Footnote: Coxe, \\\"History of the, House of Austria,\\\" vol. v., p. 51.]\\n\\nHush! Was there a muffled sound behind her? She paused and listened, her, eyes glaring as though they would start from their sockets. Pshaw! it, was only the rustling of her own silk mantle as it went trailing up the, marble staircase. Nothing in human shape was there, save two pale, statues, which stood like dead sentinels at the head of the stairs. As, she passed these she shuddered, and almost fancied that they had stepped, from their pedestals to follow her. Giving one quick glance behind, she, sped like a hunted doe through those halls, of which so lately she had, been the pride, and arrived breathless at the door of her boudoir. She, darted in, and there, safe in its place, was the picture.\\n\\n\\\"That I told him I would take rooms at the Hotel of the Ambassadors, but, I also reserve to myself this nice little bachelor establishment, to, which I may retreat when I feel inclined to do so. The advantage of, these double quarters is, that nobody will know exactly where to find, me, and I shall enjoy some freedom from parade. At the Hotel of the, Ambassadors I shall be continually bored with imperial honors. Here, on, the contrary, I am free as air, and can study Paris at my leisure.\\\"\\n\\nShe disappeared behind a little grove of trees, while her sister, contemplated their handsome patient. He lay perfectly quiet, his eyes, open, but feeling too weary for speech. He felt uncertain whether he, waked or dreamed, nor did he care; for the present moment was, unutterably sweet. His pain was slight, and with his head pillowed upon, the lap of the lovely girl whose face was beautiful as that of Eve in, the groves of Eden, the emperor gazed on in rapture.\\n\\nand jewels signified--marriage. Of that, there could be no doubt. But, who was to be the bride? The Archduchess Elizabeth was past thirty., Could it be that there was any truth in the rumor of a projected, marriage between herself and the old King of France? She was tired of, life at the court of Austria, and would have welcomed the change, had, the negotiations which were pending on that subject ever come to, anything. But they did not. [Footnote: They were frustrated by the, Countess du Barry, who never forgave the Duke de Choiseul for, entertaining the project. Du Barry prevailed upon the king to say that, he was too old to marry, and she revenged herself on Choiseul by, bringing about his disgrace. Alex. Dumas, \\\"History of Louis XV.\\\"]\\n\\nNeither of the two had gained any thing by this long war, except, glorious victories, honorable wounds, and a knowledge of the power and, bravery of its enemy. Both had serious burdens to bear, which, for many, years to come, would be painful reminders of the past. Austria, to cover, the expenses of the war, had invented paper money, and had flooded the, empire with millions of coupons. Prussia had coined base money, and all, the employes of the state had received notes, which were nicknamed, \\\"Beamtenscheine.\\\" After the war these notes were exchanged for this base, currency, which soon afterward was withdrawn from circulation as, worthless. But Prussia had obtained from Austria full recognition of her, rights to Silesia, and she in return had pledged herself to vote for, Joseph as candidate for the crown of Rome, and to support the, pretensions of the empress to the reversion of the duchy of Modena.\\n\\n\\\"You are a noble-hearted child, my Antoinette,\\\" said she. \\\"With such, sensibility as yours, you are likely to suffer from the faults and, misconceptions of the world; for magnanimity is so rare that it is often, misunderstood. You would share your sister's danger, while believing in, its reality. No, no, darling, I cannot accept your generous sacrifice., It would be useless, for Josepha's terror will shorten her prayers., Before you could reach the chapel, she will have left it--\\\"\\n\\nAt length he heaved one long, convulsive sigh. \\\"No--there is no other, remedy. I have toiled in vain--my beautiful structure has fallen, and my, grave is under its ruins! O my God, why may I not have a few months more, of life, wherewith to crush these aspiring rebels? But no!. I must die, now, and leave them to triumph over my defeat; for I dare not leave to, my successor the accursed inheritance of civil war. To the last hour of, my life I must humble my will before the decree of that cruel destiny, which has persecuted me from boyhood! Be it so!--I must clutch at the, remedy--the fearful remedy--I must revoke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come hither, my son,\\\" said the empress, reaching her hand to Joseph., \\\"Since I have seen fit to give my consent to this thing, I have nothing, wherewith to reproach you. As co-regent I hope that what I am about to, say will obtain your approbation. Monsignore, you have read to me the, order of his holiness, Clement XIV., for the suppression of the Jesuits., For my part, nothing would ever have induced me to expel them from my, dominions. But since his holiness sees fit to do so, I feel it to be my, duty, as a true daughter of the Church, to allow the order to be put, into execution. [Footnote: The empress's own words. Gross-Horitnger\\n\\n\\\"It means that I will make every effort to prevent a war between Russia, and Austria. If, in spite of all that I could do, there should be war, between you, it would not be possible for Prussia to remain neutral., Were she to do so, she would deserve the contempt both of friend and, foe. I would fulfil my obligations to Russia, that I might secure the, duration of our alliance. But I sincerely hope that it may be my good, fortune to mediate with such results as will spare me the espousal of, either party's quarrel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here in the centre, are the empire of Greece and the Archipelago. Take, notice of the colors on the map, for they show the boundaries. The, yellow is the boundary-line of the Greek empire. It begins in the, northwest by Ragusa, takes in Skopia, Sophia Phillippolis and Adrianople, as far as the Black Sea. It then descends and includes the Ionian, islands, the Archipelago, Mitylene, and Samos. That is the empire of, Constantine, whose capital is to be Constantinople. The red lines show, the future boundaries of Russia. They pass through Natolia, beginning in, the north by Pendavaschi, and end with the Gulf of Syria.\\\"\\n\\nThe streets were thronged with people that shouted for joy: the, balconies and windows were filled with elegant women, who smiled and, waved their hands in greeting to the royal pair. For all the world this, was a day of rejoicing, except for the two persons for whose sake the, rest rejoiced. These had no part in the universal gayety; and the mirth, which was inspired by their presence found no echo in their, souls--Joseph's heart was full of dislike and ill-will toward his, betrothed, and she was unhappy, fearing the reception that awaited her., She had trembled as she thought of the meeting with Joseph, and then of, the proud, powerful, and beautiful woman who was his mother. The fame of, her intellect, fascinations, and beauty had reached the court of Munich\\n\\n\\\"There are other ways of conquering besides the sword,\\\" said the crafty, Kaunitz. \\\"Coercion would but fortify the Magyars in their insolence., These haughty lords must be enticed from their fastnesses to Vienna., They must be greeted with honors, titles, and estates. They must be, taught to love splendor, to spend money, to accumulate debts, until they, become bankrupt, and their possessions in Hungary fall into the hands of, the crown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, Marianne,\\\" said he, putting his arm around her waist, \\\"hear the, secret history of my musical career. I will tell you of the misfortunes, which my genius has encountered through life. I begin with England. It, is of no use to go back to the privations of my boyhood, though they, were many; for hunger and thirst are the tribute that man must pay to, fate for the capital which genius gives to him, and which he must, increase with all his might and all his strength. Even as a boy I craved, less for bread than for fame; and I consecrated my life and soul to art., I thought that I was in the right way, for I had written eight operas\\n\\nBreathless and with compressed lips the king's friends listened to his, indistinct mutterings, and looked upon his swollen, livid, blackened, face. Each one had hurried by, and now they all were free again, and, were preparing to fly as far as possible from the infected spot. But the, clear, solemn voice of the archbishop--that voice which so often had, stricken terror to their worldly hearts--was heard again, and he bade, them stay.\\n\\nassured their majesties that the archduke was anxious to do right--not, because he was told so to do by others, but because he followed the, dictates of his own conscience. True, his highness would not see through, the eyes of any other person; but this, though it might be a defect in a, child, would be the reverse in a man--above all, in a sovereign. \\\"In, proof of the archduke's sincere desire to do right,\\\" continued Count, Bathiany, \\\"allow me to repeat to your majesties something which he said, to me yesterday. We were reading together Bellegarde on knowledge of, self and of human nature. The beautiful thoughts of the author so, touched the heart of his highness, that, stopping suddenly, he exclaimed, to me, 'We must read this again; for when I come to the throne I shall, need to know, not only myself, but other men also.'\\\"\\n\\nconstructed after \\\"his excellency's own design.\\\" Kaunitz was not aware, of it, but this wig of his, with its droll mixture of flowing locks, before, and prim purse behind, was an exact counterpart of the life and, character of its inventor. He had had no intention of being symbolic in, his contrivance; it had been solely designed to conceal the little, tell-tale lines that were just about to indent the smooth surface of his, white forehead. He bent his proud head, while the hair-dresser placed, the wonderful wig, and then fell to studying its effect. Here he drew a, curl forward, there he gently removed another; placing each one in its, position over his eyebrows, so that no treacherous side-light should, reveal any thing he chose to hide. Finally the work was done., \\\"Hippolyte,\\\" said he, to the hair-dresser, who stood breathlessly by\\n\\npainful by reason of the aching bones of three-score and ten. The young, princesses dared not raise their eyes to these representatives of, by-gone coquetry, for they were afraid to commit a crime--they were, afraid that they might laugh. But the ladies of honor, safe behind the, hoops of the queen and her sisters-in-law made merry over the, magnificent old ruins. Madame de Noailles was so busy with the front\\n\\n\\\"I have heard this fable before,\\\" said Rachel, with a glance of mourn., \\\"The priest who was sent to convert, has tried to console me for my, loss, by dinning in my ears that Gunther was a traitor; but I know, better. He is the victim of a Jew's revenge. It is you who have accused, him with false witnesses, false letters, with all that vengeance can, inspire, and wicked gold can buy. You are the accuser of my noble, Gunther!\\\" By this time she had arisen, and now she stood confronting her, father, her wasted finger pointing toward him, and her sunken eyes, glowing like lights from a dark, deep cave. \\\"Who says so? Who has dared, accuse me?\\\" said he.\\n\\nAll this, however, did not prevent the execution of the order for the, expulsion of the nuns. In spite of priests and people, the decree was, carried out on the 12th of January, of the year 1782. A multitude had, assembled before the convent of the Clarisserines whence the sisters, were about to be expelled, and where the sacred vessels and vestments, appertaining to the altars were to be exposed for sale at auction!\\n\\nThe trousseau of the archduchess was exposed in the apartments which had, once been occupied by the empress and her husband; and now Maria, Theresa, followed by a bevy of wondering young archduchesses, was, examining her daughter's princely wardrobe, that with her own eyes she, might be sure that nothing was wanting to render it worthy of a, queen-elect. The young girls burst into exclamations of rapture when, they approached the table where, in its snowy purity, lay the bridal, dress of white velvet, embroidered with pearls and diamonds.\\n\\n\\\"At the conclusion of the unhappy war which desolated both Austria and, Prussia, I had to consider what course for the future was likely to, recuperate the prostrate energies of Austria. I resolved in my mind, various schemes, and laid them before her imperial majesty. The one, which I advocated and which was adopted by the empress, had mainly for, its object the pacification of all European broils, and the restoration, of the various Austrian dependencies to order and prosperity. For some, time I waited to see whether your majesty would not seek to conciliate, France, and renew your old league of friendship with her king. But the, policy pursued by your majesty at the court of Russia convinced me that, you were thinking exclusively of securing your provinces in the east., This once understood, it became the interest of Austria to rivet the, links which bound her to France; for an alliance with her offered the, same advantages to us as that of Russia did to Prussia. Moreover, it was, Austria's opinion that Prussia was now too closely bound to Russia for, her ever to seek an alliance with France. It therefore appeared that our, good understanding with the latter would conduce to preserve the balance, of power among European nations, and that it would meet with the favor, of all those potentates who were anxious for peace. It follows thence, that the court of Vienna is perfectly content with her relations toward, France; and I expressly and distinctly declare to your majesty that we, never will seek to alienate Russia from Prussia, that we never will, encourage any advances from Russia, and that your majesty may rest, assured that we never will deviate from our present line of policy. This, was what I desired to explain, and I thank your majesty for the courtesy, with which You have listened to me.\\\" [Footnote: This discourse of Kannitz is, historical. It is found in Ferrand's \\\"Histoire des Trois Demembrements, de la Pologue,\\\" vol. i., p. 112.]\\n\\nMesmer played on, and now his music seemed an entreaty to some invisible, spirit to appear and reveal itself to mortal eyes. At least, so it, sounded to the ears of his listeners. They started--for responsive to, the call, a tall white figure, whose feet seemed scarcely to touch the, floor, glided in and stood for a moment irresolute. Mesmer raised his, hand and stretching it out toward her, she moved. Still he played on\\n\\n\\\"And this alliance,\\\" said Kaunitz, still pursuing the object for which, he was contending, \\\"this marriage is the result of one letter to, Farinelli. Your majesty once condescended to write to La Pompadour. THAT, letter won the friendship of France, and its fruits will be the marriage, of the Archduchess Marie Antoinette, and her elevation to the throne of, France. Your majesty sees then what important results have sprung from, two friendly letters which my honored sovereign has not disdained to, write. Surely when wise statesmanship prompts your majesty to indite a, third letter to the Empress of Russia, you will not refuse its counsels, and suggestions. The two first letters were worth to us two thrones; the, third may chance to be worth a new province.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Long live the emperor!\\\"' cried Joseph, contemptuously. \\\"They treat me, as savages do their wooden idols, When they are unpropitious they beat, them; when otherwise, they set them up and adore them again. Those over, whom I reign, however, shall see that I am no wooden idol, but a man and, a monarch, who draws his sword to avenge an affront from whomsoever, received. Blood alone will extinguish the fire; of this rebellion, and, it shall be quenched in the blood of the rebels.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me kneel, let me kneel!\\\" exclaimed she, while her beautiful eyes, suffused with tears. \\\"Here, at your feet, let me implore your protection, for Poland! Have mercy, sire, upon the Confederates, whose only crime is, their resistance to foreign oppression. Reach out your imperial band to, THEM, and bid them be free, for they must either be slaves, or die by, their own hands.

Gracious Heaven! what, if he should be proof against the, blandishments of woman! I fear me he is too cold--and Poland will be, lost.

As a child I have felt that my mother, loved another son more than she loved me. When my longing eyes sought, hers, they were riveted upon another face. When my brother and I have, sinned together, he has been forgiven, when I have been punished. Sorrow, and jealousy were in my heart, and no one cared enough for me to ask why, I wept. I was left to suffer without one word of kindness--and you, wondered that I was taciturn, and mocked at my slighted longings for, love, and called them by hard names. And then you pointed to my caressed, and indulged brother, and bade me be gay like him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" repeated Kaunitz emphatically, \\\"he will find his master in me. I, have never failed to make other men subservient to my schemes, and the, King of Prussia shall grace my triumph with the rest. He is the vassal, of Austria, and I will be the one to force him back to his allegiance., It is scandalous that this petty king should have been suffered to play, an important part in European affairs. I will drive him from his, accidental grandeur, and he shall return to his duty. I will humble him, if I can; for this King of Prussia is the only man in Europe who has, denied me the honors and consideration due me as a politician and a, prince.\\\" [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Ferrand, vol. i., p. 104]\\n\\nAt this moment there was a knock at the door, and the Duchess of Orleans, entered the room. A triumphant smile lit up the face of Madame, Etiquette, for now the ceremony would be prolonged. It was no longer her, duty, it was that of the duchess, to wait upon the queen. But the proud, Countess de Noailles could not condescend to pass the garment to the, duchess. That was the duty of the aforesaid lady of the bedchamber. The, mistress of ceremonies motioned her to approach, and the duchess began, to draw off her gloves.\\n\\nMeanwhile the king and the emperor reached the apartment which opened, into the private dining-room of the royal family. The princes with their, wives were already there; but Marie Antoinette always came at the last, moment. She dreaded the sarcasm of the Count de Provence, and the sullen, or contemptuous glances of the king. She would have given much to return, to the old stiff, public ceremonial which she had banished, but that she, could not do. It would have been too great a concession to the court., Her only refuge was to stay away as long as decorum allowed, and after, the emperor's arrival she never entered the room until he had been, announced.\\n\\n\\\"We shall rob it of its sting before we rob it of its treasures. And, whence comes the sting of these troublesome gnats? It resides in the, riches of the church and the privileges of the nobles.

The lord of the soil shall come down to the level of his serf\\n\\n\\\"But skill has availed; and to Van Swieten, under Providence, I am, indebted for my life,\\\" cried the empress, warmly. \\\"I know, Kaunitz, that, you have but little faith in heavenly or earthly physicians; and I pray, God that you may never acquire it through the bitter experience of such, suffering as I have but lately endured! Often during my sleepless nights, I have longed for a sight of your grave face, and it grieved me to think, that perchance we might never meet again to talk of Austria, and plan, for Austria's welfare. \\\"\\n\\nThe soldier bowed low. \\\"I put down my musket, and when the hour came, round for me to be relieved, I asked leave of my captain to come here to, see an old acquaintance. And, indeed, your majesty, I was not telling a, lie, for you once slept under my father's roof, and paid him so well for, the night's lodging, that he was able to buy some land to settle me upon, it, and thereupon I married my sweetheart. So that I did come to see an, old acquaintance; and now, your majesty, I have a firm hand and a sharp, eye, and if you say so, Frederick shall bite the dust before this day, week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You HAVE wounded it, your majesty,\\\" replied the emperor, with emphasis., \\\"You have dogged my steps with spies; you have suffered my character to, be discussed by your attendants. You have gone so far as to compromise, me with my own servants; forcing them to disobey me by virtue of your, rights as sovereign exercised in opposition to mine as your husband. I, gave Gaspardi orders to deliver Riccardo's note to me alone. I forbade, him to tell any one whither he went. YOU took my note from him by force\\n\\n\\\"His heart!\\\" exclaimed the girl. \\\"The emperor is without a heart. Even, toward his mother he is said to be undutiful and obstinate. He hates his, wife, and she is as mild as an angel. He whose pleasure it is to see an, empress at his feet, do you suppose that he can sympathize with the, misfortunes of his subjects? No, no; he has already stopped all pensions, which the generous empress had given from her private purse.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph had refused to attend the funeral. From the hour his, consciousness had returned to him he had locked himself within his, apartments, and night and day he was heard pacing the floor with dull, and measured tread. Not even the empress, who had stood imploring at the, door, could obtain a word in answer to her entreaties. For two days and, nights lie remained within. On the third day the emperor knocked at the, door, and announced to his son that all was now ready for the funeral\\n\\nHere the empress turned from the mirror and crossing over to the spot, where the emperor's portrait hung, she continued her soliloquy. \\\"But, Franz, dear Franz, you at least are spared the sight of your Theresa's, transformation. I could not have borne this as I do, if you had been, here to witness it. Now! what matters it? My people will not remind me, of it, and my children have already promised to love me, and forgive my, deformity. Sleep, then, my beloved, until I rejoin you in heaven. There\\n\\nMademoiselle Bertin, with a solemnity befitting the importance of her, office, swore that henceforth the hands which had been honored by, carrying out the ideas of a queen, should never work for lesser mortals;, that her dresses should be made with closed doors, and that she would, rather be led to execution than betray to a living soul the mysteries of, her royal patroness's toilet. [Footnote: Mademoiselle Bertin, from that, day, became an important personage, and received many a rich present, from noble ladies anxious to imitate the queen in dress.]\\n\\n\\\"It would have been a pretty anecdote for the history of the Emperor, Joseph, had he been discovered in a street brawl with a carman,\\\" said he, to himself. \\\"A little more, and my imperial face would have been pounded, into jelly by that Hercules of a fellow! It is not such an easy matter, as I had supposed, to mix on equal terms with other men! But I shall, learn by bitter experience how to behave.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor did not answer--his heart was too full for speech. The, empress saw his agitation, and opening her arms to clasp him in her, embrace, she faltered out, \\\"Come, dear child, and together let us mourn, for our beloved dead.\\\" [Footnote: The institution founded on that day by, the empress went very soon into operation. Every spring the children of, fifty families among the nobles and gentry were received at the hospital, of Hetzendorf. The empress was accustomed to visit the institution, frequently; and at the end of each season, she gave its little inmates a, splendid ball, which was always attended by herself and her daughters., The festivities closed with concerts, lotteries, and a present to each, child.

But I hope that my, little Antoinette has too much sense to be affected by Aufresne's, nonsense, and that she will accept the husband whom her sovereign and, mother has chosen for her. It is a bright destiny, that of a Queen of, France; and if snakes and cats should come near your throne, you must, tread them under foot. Look up, my child, and have courage. In two years, you will be the bride of the dauphin. Prepare yourself meanwhile to be a, worthy representative of your native Austria. The Queen of France must\\n\\nThe Countess Wielopolska was leaving Vienna forever, and yet there was, no message for him. A longing, that seemed to drown him in the flood of, its intensity, rushed over his soul. He would fly to her presence and, implore her to forgive the chant of victory that was rejoicing over her, country's grave! Oh, the crash of that stunning harmony, how it maddened, him, as kneeling, he listened to its last exultant notes!\\n\\nMaria Theresa, always munificent, had devoted one wing of the palace to, the exclusive use of her young daughter-in-law; and her apartments were, fitted up with the last degree of splendor. Elegant mirrors, buhl and, gilded furniture, costly turkey carpets and exquisite paintings adorned, this princely home; and as the princess was known to be skilled both as, a painter and musician, one room was fitted up for her as a studio, and, another as a music-hall.\\n\\nConformably to her wishes, many irksome court-customs had been laid, aside at Marly. The strict lines of demarcation between royalty and, nobility no longer hampered the daily intercourse of the sovereigns and, their subjects. The lords and ladies in waiting were at liberty to join, the queen's circle in the drawing-rooms, or to group themselves together, as inclination prompted. Some talked over the events of the day, some, discussed the new books which lay in heaps upon a table in one of the, saloons; others, again, played billiards with the king.\\n\\n\\\"For your majesty, as well as for me, it suffices that I am true to my, duties as your subject. As to my duty as a man, this is no place to, discuss a matter which lies between God and myself it would be, indecorous for me to raise the veil of my private life before the eyes, of your majesty. I came here to speak of Austria's welfare and yours\\n\\nOne of their own class, however, succeeded in drawing them from their, hiding-places. The loud voice of Horja rang throughout every valley, and, ascended to every mountain-summit. He called them to liberty and, equality. He asserted that nobility was to be destroyed in Hungary., There were to be no more castles, no more magnates of the land. The, emperor had promised as much in Vienna. He had sworn to free the, Hungarian peasantry, and to bring the proud noble down to an equality, with his serf.\\n\\n\\\"Not even if I beg it as a favor to myself?\\\" asked Joseph fervently., \\\"Not even if I tell you that I have no wish so near at heart as that of, knowing the King of Prussia? Think of this day, so brightened to me by, the sunshine of your tenderness! Let the mother plead for me with the, sovereign; for it is not to my empress, it is to my mother that I, confide my hopes and wishes. Oh, do not drown the harmony of this hour, in discord! Do not interpose a cloud between us now.\\\"\\n\\nTherese Paradies was to give a concert, the first at which she had, performed since the restoration of her sight. Of course, the hall was, thronged, for in spite of the incontrovertible fact itself, and of its, corroboration by the Paradies family, there were two parties in, Vienna--one who believed in the cure, and the other who did not. Those, who did not, doubted upon the respectable testimony of Professor Barth\\n\\n\\\"It was a crime,\\\" continued she in a voice of deepest emotion, \\\"but she, has paid dearly for her sin. Her husband repulsed her, but her heart was, still his; he despised her, and yet she adores him. Her malady has long, since disappeared; her heart alone is sick; that heart which will break, if her lord refuse to forgive her the offence that was born of her love, for him! But oh, sire, he has no pity. When she meets him with imploring, looks, he turns away; her letters he sends to her unopened. Oh, he is, severe in his wrath; it is like vengeance from Heaven! But still she, loves, and still she hopes that one day he will be generous, and forgive, her another crime--that of not being blessed with beauty. For months she, has longed to tell him that she repents of her faults, that her, punishment is just; but, oh! oh! she begs for mercy. She was forbidden, to follow him to Innspruck, but she could not stay behind. His parents, gave their consent, and she is here at your knees, my lord and king, to, plead for mercy. Oh! has there not been enough of cruelty? See me, humbled at your feet; reach me your beloved hand, and bid me sit by your, side! \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" interrupted the banker, laughing. \\\"Who should betray you?, Not I. And no one but us two are in the secret. Who, then, should tell, the emperor that you were hidden behind the door while he dictated his, dispatches, and that you are such a skilful imitator? I swear that, Gunther himself would have been staggered had he seen those letters!, They are capital, and I congratulate you. You are a genius.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Lacy, gravely, \\\"it is possible that the flames of a, revolution may burst forth to consume this unhappy land. Oh, sire, have, mercy upon the poor people, whose eyes cannot endure the light of, reform! Preserve yourself and your subjects from the horrors of a, revolt, which, although it would be ultimately quelled, might cost, bloodshed and misery!

What has she done that you should thrust her from, your heart, and doom her to confront, alone, the sneers and hatred of, your cruel relatives? She is pure, and her heart is without a stain. I, tell you so--I, who in unspeakable anxiety have watched her through, hired spies. Had I found her guilty I would have been the first to, condemn her; but Antoinette is good, pure, virtuous, and she has but one, defect--want of thought. It was your duty to guide her, for you received, her from her mother's hands a child--a young, harmless, unsuspecting, child. What has she ever done that you should refuse her your love?\\\"\\n\\nit is too late, I cannot retract upon the very eve of battle. The army, knows that we are about to engage the enemy, and my men are wild with, enthusiasm. The presence of Frederick upon Austrian soil is an indignity, which I am pledged as a man to avenge. If I allow him to retreat from, his present disadvantageous position, my name is gone forever, and all, Europe will cry out upon my incapacity to command. Remember, Leopold\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sire, they are indignant. Yesterday the first burial, according to, your majesty's edict, took place, and since then the people are in a, state of revolt. To-day there are of course other bodies to be interred., There is not a vagrant in the streets that does not utter threats, against your majesty. From the burgher to the beggar, every man feels, that his sacred rights have been invaded. They feel that the prohibition, of coffins and burying-grounds does not reach the rich, who have their, hereditary tombs in churches and chapels, but the people, who have no, such privileges.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! who will be troubled with looking into my heart in imperial, Vienna?\\\" sobbed the disheartened Josepha. \\\"Externals are every thing in, court; and I, unhappy one, who scarcely dare not utter my heart's, yearnings to those who encourage me, what will become of me if I meet, with cold glances or scornful words? I feel how little I am skilled to, win love, and the consciousness of my defects heightens them and renders, me still more repulsive.\\\"\\n\\nthat `he never did and never will commit an act of injustice.' Concede, that Victor Emanuel is the soul of honor; still,\\\" added Kaunitz with a, shake of the head, and an incredulous smile \\\"still--the Italian princes, are abominable geographers--and they are inordinately fond of, artichokes. [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Kotmayr, \\\"Austrian, Plutarch,\\\" vol. xi.] Now their fondness for this vegetable is as, dangerous to Austria as the too loving grasp of her northern allies, who, with their friendly hands not only close their ports against us, but lay, the weight of their favors so heavily upon our heads as to force us, down upon our knees before them. What have we from England and Holland, but their subsidies? And Austria can now afford to relinquish them--, Austria is rich, powerful, prosperous enough to be allowed to proffer, her friendship where it will be honorably returned. Austria, then, must, be freed from her oppressive alliance with the maritime powers. She has, youth and vitality enough to shake off this bondage, and strike for the, new path which shall lead her to greatness and glory. There is a moral, and intangible greatness, of whose existence these trading Englishmen, have no conception, but which the refined and elevated people of France, are fully competent to appreciate. France extends to us her hand, and, offers us alliance on terms of equality. Cooperating with France, we, shall defy the enmity of all Europe. With our two-edged sword we shall, turn the scales of future European strife, and make peace or war for, other nations. France, too, is our natural ally, for she is our, neighbor. And she is more than this, for she is our ally by the sacred, unity of one faith. The Holy Father at Rome, who blesses the arms of, Austria, will no longer look sorrowfully upon Austria's league with, heresy. When apostolic France and we are one, the blessings of the, Church will descend upon our alliance. Religion, therefore, as well as, honest statesmanship, call for the treaty with France.\\\"\\n\\nMarie Antoinette colored with vexation at this reproof in presence of, one of her own subjects. \\\"Brother,\\\" replied she hastily, \\\"I admire the, facility with which you generalize on the subject of other people's, derelictions. Unhappily, your homilies are sometimes misapplied. My, secretary, Monsieur d'Augeard, has my full confidence; and these papers, are merely the quarterly accounts of my household expenditures. They, have already been approved by the auditor, and you perceive that I risk, nothing by affixing my signature.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were right, dear sister, but I am not so agreeable that you should, wish to have me constantly at your side. I wish to become acquainted, with your beautiful Paris. It is so full of treasures of art and wonders, of industry, that a man has only to use his eyes, and he grows, accomplished. I am much in need of such advantages, sire, for you will, find me a barbarian for whose lapses you will have to be indulgent.\\\"\\n\\nby importing goods free of tax, and reselling them here. All Vienna, knows that there are more silk stockings sold at the hotel of the French, embassy than in all Paris and Lyons together. The world blames me for, having revoked the privilege enjoyed by foreign embassies to import, their clothing free of duty. It does not know that the abuse of this, privilege by yourself has forced me to the measure.\\\"\\n\\nlooked wildly around. Her husband's sigh had awakened her from a, blissful dream, and once more her weary heart sank desolate to the, earth. But with an expression of tenderest pity she turned toward him, and smiled. Then her music changed; it pealed out in rich harmony, fit, for mortal ears. She saw her complete mastery over the archduke's soul;, his eyes grew bright and joyful once more, and from his countenance, beamed the light of perfect contentment.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Gregory,\\\" exclaimed Catharine, again moved to tears, \\\"I shall never, forget these words! You have sacrificed much for me, and you shall have, princely reward; on my word you shall! Let the grand duke be careful to, utter no inconsiderate words, for the steppes of Siberia are as, accessible to the prince as to the peasant; and every traitor, were he, the heir of the crown itself, is amenable to justice before me! And, Panin, with his eternal pratings of honesty and frankness, let him, too\\n\\nShe bent over and kissed the emperor's mouth, and for a moment laid her, head upon his cold, still bosom. Then again she drew her hand softly, across his eyes, and tried to close them. A proud smile flitted over her, wan face, for the eyes of the corpse closed. The loving hand of the wife, had prevailed where every other effort had failed. True to her wishes in, death as in life, the dead emperor had shut his eyes to earth forever.\\n\\nBut he was interrupted by the sound of music--music so exquisite that, the heart of the learned professor himself responded to its pathos. It, swelled and swelled until it penetrated the room and filled all space, with its thrilling notes. All present felt its power, and every eye was, fixed upon the enchanter, who was swaying a multitude as though their, emotions had been his slaves, and his music the voice that bade them, live or die.\\n\\n\\\"An emperor, a widower of two wives,\\\" said he to himself, \\\"and he treats, us to an idyl of the genuine Gessner stamp! An imperial Damon who spends, his time twining wreaths of roses with his Philis! Well--he had better, be left to play the fool in peace; his pastoral will keep him from, meddling in state affairs. Men call me the coachman of European, politics; so be it, and let no one meddle with my coach-box. That noble, empress is of one mind with me, but this emperor would like to snatch, the reins, and go careering over the heavens for himself. So much the, better if he flirts and drinks milk with a dairymaid. But how long will, it last? Eberhard, of course, has gone to Porhammer, who being piously, disinclined to such little pastimes, will go straight to the empress;, and then Damon will be reproved, and I--I may fall under her displeasure, for having known and concealed her son's intrigue. What shall I do?, Shall I warn the emperor so that he can carry off his Semele, and go on, with his amours? Or shall I--bah! Let things shape themselves. What do I, care for them all?

I, repeal the conscription-act, as well as all my reforms with respect to, the church. When this is ready, bring it to me for signature; and, dispatch a courier with it to the imperial stadtholder. Having satisfied, the exactions of Hungary and Tyrol, it remains to restore order in the, Netherlands. But there, matters are more complicated, and I fear that no, concession on my part will avail at this late hour. I must trample my, personal pride in the dust, then, and humble myself before the pope!, Yes--before the pope! I will write, requesting him to act as mediator\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty; but it is one which it is imperative for us to, follow. Necessity alone decides a national course of action. A good, statesman cannot be a cosmopolitan. He looks out for himself, and leaves, others to do the same. If Poland succumbs, it will be because she has, not the strength to live. Therefore, if her hour be come, let her die., We dare not go to her relief, for, before the weal of other nations, we, must have peace and prosperity for Austria.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, my lady, I took your note to the palace, where the emperor, has given positive orders that every one who wishes it shall be admitted, to his presence. The guard before the door let me pass into the, antechamber. One of the lords in waiting told me that the emperor would, be there before a quarter of an hour. I had not waited so long when the, door opened and a handsome young man in a plain white uniform walked in., I should never have taken him for the emperor, except that the lord, stood up so straight when he saw him. Then I knelt down and gave the, letter. The emperor took it and said: 'Tell your lady that I am not, prepared to receive ladies in my palace; but since she wishes to see me\\n\\n\\\"It cannot be,\\\" cried the empress. \\\"There is no sympathy between Austria, and Prussia, and peace will never come to Europe until one succumbs to, the other. No dependence is to be placed upon alliances between, incongruous nations. In spite of our allies, the English, the Dutch, and, the Russians, the King of Prussia has robbed me of my province; and all, the help I have ever got from them was empty condolence. For this reason, I have sought for alliance with another power--a power which will, cordially unite with me in crushing that hateful infidel, to whom, nothing in life is sacred. This is the news that I promised you. Our, treaty with England and Holland is about to expire, and the new ally I, have found for Austria is France.\\\"\\n\\nHe was therefore ill-prepared for the news which reached him from, Hungary. He had freed the people from slavery and taxation, and had, exacted that the nobles should pay their share of the imperial taxes. He, had instituted a general conscription, and the most powerful Magyar in, Hungary was bound to serve, side by side, with the lowest peasant., Finally he had forbidden the use of any other language in Hungary save, the German.\\n\\n\\\"Lacy,\\\" said the emperor, as they galloped off together, \\\"you must, prepare yourself for a long ride. We had anticipated an early start, to-day, and we are punctual. To be sure, we are minus an army, and, neither our hearts nor our trumpets are sounding triumphant blasts of, victory. Ah, friend, what miserable puppets we are in the hands of, Almighty God! Yesterday I was gazing exultingly upon the heaven of the, future, so clear, so blue, so silver-bright--when lo! the rustling of a, woman's dress is heard, and the sky of my destiny grows black as night., Yesterday I fancied myself a man--to-day I am a schoolboy in disgrace, upon my knees. Oh, Lacy, those weary knees ache me so, that I could sob, for pain, were it not laughable for a commander-in-chief to put his, handkerchief to his eyes.\\n\\nShe thought how her poor, martyred heart had never been able to give up, all hope of love and happiness; how day by day she had striven, through, humility and obedience, to appease her husband's anger. But he had, always repulsed her. One day she had resolved that he SHOULD see her., She knew that the emperor was in the daily habit of sitting on the, balcony which divided her apartments from his. She watched his coming\\n\\nHer son dared not offer his hand, for evil eyes were upon him, and he, allowed her to depart without a word. Slowly she traversed the scene of, sinful splendor, her tall, dark figure reflected from mirror to mirror, as she went; and before the receding vision of that crushed and, despairing mother the lights above seemed to pale, and the gilding of, those rich saloons grew dim and spectral.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" interrupted Josepha, \\\"I have not been unhappy; for I--I have, loved. I die happy; for he whom I love no longer turns abhorrent from my, presence. I shall die by the light of your pardoning smile. Death, that, comes every moment nearer, death, to me, brings happiness. He comes with, his cold kiss, to take my parting breath--the only kiss my lips have, ever felt. He brings me love and consolation. He takes from my face the, hideous mask which it has worn through life; and my soul's beauty, in, another world, shall win me Joseph's love. Oh death, the comforter! I, feel thy kiss. Farewell, Joseph, farewell!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I beg of your majesty to allow me to quit your service,\\\" replied the, man moodily. \\\"I cannot forget the words of Maria Theresa. I will not, skulk away from the world while I have strength to work. I am tired of, the idle life I lead. It is summer, and there is no fire to kindle. As, for the poor unfortunates whom I used to visit, I can do them no good;, their benefactress is no more. I must do something, or life will be a, burden; and if your majesty will condescend to give me leave, I shall, seek another place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thank your majesty,\\\" said he, after a pause. \\\"Your conduct toward me, is noble and magnanimous, and I shall be grateful for it to my latest, breath. You have acted as became a sovereign who has no right to set at, defiance the laws he has made. Had I been his judge, I should myself, have condemned the criminal who was once my son, and to-day is the, murderer of his mother. Years ago I sat in judgment over this, transgressor and when I did so, I lost my only child. As for the man who, to-day has suffered the penalty of his crimes, I know him no longer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You deny it--do you? Let me tell you that your praise or your blame are, all one to me; and if I have granted you this interview, it was to show, you how little I am disturbed by your censorious language. I know, something of the intriguing at Versailles. I have even heard of the, private orgies of the 'Oeil de Boeuf,' where Louis entertains his, favorites. And I will tell you what took place at the last one. The, Countess du Barry was diverting the company with accounts of the, hypocrisy of the Empress of Austria; and to prove it, she drew from her, pocket-book a letter, saying: 'Hear what the Cardinal de Rohan says, about her.' Now, cardinal, do you still deny that you correspond with, her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have seen them all,\\\" replied the empress, sadly. \\\"I have read all the, documents by which you have sought to prove that Austria has claims upon, Lower Bavaria, because, in 1410, the Emperor Sigismund enfeoffed his, son-in-law, Albert of Austria, with this province. I have read further, that in 1614 the Emperor Matthias gave to the archducal house the, reversion of the Suabian estate of Mindelheim, which subsequently, in, 1706, when the Elector of Bavaria fell under the ban of the empire, was, actually claimed by the Emperor of Austria. I have also learned that the, Upper Palatinate, with all its counties, by the extinction of the, Wittelsbach dynasty, becomes an open feoff, to which the Emperor of, Austria thinks that he may assert his claims.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor uttered a cry of fury, and grew pale with rage. \\\"He, reinstated the Joyeuse Entree! He presumed to do it! Did I not tell you, that Christina was my enemy? She it is who has brought this humiliation, upon me! She has dared revoke what I had commanded!--Oh, how those, vulgar rebels must have laughed to see that with their pestiferous, breath they lead power to blow away my edicts like so many card-houses!\\\"\\n\\nThe empress quickly raised her head, and, with something like her, accustomed imperiousness, said: \\\"I forbid any one of you to speak of, what you have seen to-night. In the simplicity of my grief, I do what my, heart urges me to do; but let not my sorrow become the subject of the, world's idle gossip. When the husband dies his wife, be she empress or, beggar, is nothing but a sorrowing widow. Ah! I am indeed beggared of, all my wealth, for I have lost the dearest treasure I possessed on, earth. All my joys will die with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us be seated!\\\" said the emperor, \\\"and pray admire my omelet and my, strawberries. Now, Coronini, the strawberries are tempting, but before, you taste them, I must tell you that they are tainted with treason:, treason toward my own sacred person. Reflect well before you decide to, eat them. What I am going to relate is as terrible as it is true. While, my omelet was cooking, I strolled out into the road to see if there was, any thing else in Wichern besides poultry, pigs, and dirty children., Coming toward me I perceived a pretty little barefoot boy, with a basket, full of red, luscious strawberries. I asked where he was going. He said, to the neighboring village to sell his strawberries to the farmer's, wife, who had ordered them. I offered to buy them, but my gold could not, tempt the child--he refused peremptorily to sell them to me at any, price. I argued, pleaded, threatened; all to no purpose. At length\\n\\n\\\"I do wish nobody else would come here,\\\" thought he, in an ecstasy of, disinterestedness. \\\"Suppose that the enemies of his majesty should, introduce a murderer in my house, and the emperor should lose his life!, I should be eternally disgraced. I am really responsible to his, majesty's subjects for his safety. I am resolved, since he has commanded, me to let these rooms, to allow none but ladies to occupy them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Angel!\\\" said Arabella, with a mocking laugh. \\\"If so, call me your, fallen angel; for when I took the unfathomable leap which leads from, innocence to guilt, your arms were outstretched to receive me. But, pshaw! what bootless retrospection! I am here, Carl, true as steel;, ready to stand or fall at your side. Feel my hand, it is warm--feel my, pulse, it beats as evenly as though I had never slept a night out of, Eden.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His words to the Jew are as insolent as his deeds are wicked. But I, know very well how to exasperate and humble the Christians. I do it by, means of my rich dwelling and my costly equipages. I do it by inviting, them to come and see how far more sumptuously I live than they. The, sight of my luxuries blackens their hearts with envy; but most of all, they envy the Jewish banker that his daughter so far outshines in beauty, their Gentile women!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty must forgive me,\\\" reiterated the countess; \\\"I have sworn, on my mother's grave, that as long as I can be useful, I will live for, Poland. Should she regain her freedom, I will retire to a convent, where, every breath I draw shall be a thanksgiving to God. Should she be doomed, to slavery, she will need her sons and daughters no more, and then I, will die. Your majesty sees that I am already betrothed. I shall soon be, the bride of Heaven, or the bride of Death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must wait then until my mirrors are made,\\\" said the empress, after a, pause. \\\"You must think that I have less than woman's vanity, my son, if, you expect me to remain for weeks without a greeting from my, looking-glass. Of course the small-pox has not dared to disfigure the, face of an empress; I feel secure against its sacrilegious touch. Is it, not so, my little Marie Antoinette? Has it not respected your mother's, comeliness?\\\"\\n\\nEvery man had an anecdote to relate that concerned Joseph. Yesterday he, had visited the Hotel-Dieu. He had even asked for admission to the, apartments of the lying-in women, and upon being refused entrance by the, sisters, he had said, \\\"Do let me see the first scene of human misery.\\\", The sisters, struck by the words as well as by the noble bearing of the, stranger, had admitted him; and upon taking leave he had remarked to the, nun who accompanied him, \\\"The sufferings which you witness in this room\\n\\n\\\"No, I fear nothing--certainly not death,\\\" returned the emperor. \\\"It, must be sweet to die, and part from the disappointments of life; for man, either goes to eternal sleep, or wakes forever to eternal happiness! I, am not afraid of death, but I must put my house in order, for bullets, respect no man, and they have never yet been taught that an emperor is, not to be approached without ceremony. One might strike me on the head, and send me to my eternal rest. Why, what a doleful face you wear\\n\\nMarianne, smiling, reached out her hand to the astounded poet. \\\"Forgive, his stormy temper,\\\" said she, gently; \\\"he can no more bear contradiction, than a spoiled child. His wrath looks formidable; but though there is, much thunder, there is no lightning about him. Wait a quarter of an, hour, kind friend, and he will be back, suing for pardon and imploring, us to take his hand, just like a naughty child that he is. Then he will, smile, and look so ashamed that you will never have the heart to feel, resentful.\\\"\\n\\nA deadly paleness overspread the face of the young prince, and his whole, frame shivered. The emperor felt the shudder, and drew his son's arm, closer to his heart. \\\"Courage, my son, courage!\\\" whispered he: then, turning toward the imperial embassy, he said aloud, \\\"Announce to her, majesty that I will accompany the arch-duke in a few moments.\\\" And as, the marshal stood irresolute and confused, the emperor, smiling, said:, \\\"Oh, I see that you have been ordered to accompany the prince, yourselves. Come, then, my son, we will e'en go along with the, messengers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" replied the unconscious Luschinka; \\\"I have been twice married, and twice divorced; but it was not my fault. I loved my first husband, with a depth of passion which he could not appreciate, and I was in an, agony of despair when six months after our marriage he told me that he, loved me no longer, and was dying for the Countess Luwiendo. She was my, bosom friend, so you can imagine my grief; mais j'ai su faire bonne mine, a mauvais jeux. I invited the countess to my villa, and there, under the, shade of the old trees in the park, we walked arm in arm, and arranged, with my husband all the conditions of the separation. Every one praised, my generous conduct; the men in particular were in raptures, and Prince, Lubomirski, on the strength of it, fell so desperately in love with me\\n\\n\\\"For God's sake,\\\" cried Joseph, \\\"do not let the rushes hear you, lest, they betray me to the babbling wind, and the wind bear it to the King of, Prussia. But you have guessed. Bavaria is a portion of my Silesia, but, only a portion. Bavaria is mine by right of inheritance, and I shall, take it when the time comes. It will be a comely patch to stop some of, the rents in my imperial mantle. But my Silesia lies at every point of, the compass. To the east lie Bosnia and Servia--to the south, see, superannuated Venice. The lion of St. Mark is old and blind, and will, fall an easy prey to the eagle of Hapsburg, This will extend our, dominions to the Adriatic sea. When the Duke of Modena is gathered to, his fathers, my brother, in right of his wife, succeeds to the title;, and as Ferrara once belonged to the house of Modena, he and I together, can easily wrest it from the pope. Close by are the Tortonese and, Alessandria, two fair provinces which the King of Sardinia supposes to, be his. They once formed a portion of the duchy of Milan; and Milan is, ours, with every acre of land that ever belonged to it. By Heaven, I, will have all that is mine, if it cost me a seven years' war to win it, back! This is not all. Look toward the west, beyond the spires of, Strasburg, where the green and fertile plains of Alsatia woo our coming., They now belong to France, but they shall be the property of Austria., Farther on lies Lorraine. That, too, is mine, for my father's title was, 'Duke of Lorraine.' What is it to me that Francis the First sold his, birthright to France? All that I covet I shall annex to Austria, as, surely as Frederick wrested Silesia from me.\\\"\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, the chateau of Versailles was deserted. The, courtiers, pages, equerries, and lackeys, had all departed, delighted to, leave that infected atmosphere within whose poisonous influence the iron, rules of etiquette had detained them while Louis XV. lived. None of them, felt inclined to do homage to departed royalty. Even the Duke de, Villequier, first gentleman of the bed-chamber, in his terror, forgot, etiquette; and instead of watching the king's corpse, he, too, made, ready to go with the rest.\\n\\n\\\"He is right,\\\" said she, after a time. \\\"She wanders upon the edge of a, precipice, and I must save her. But, oh my God! where shall I find a, friend who will love her enough to brave her displeasure, and, in the, midst of the flattery which surrounds her, will raise the honest voice, of reproof and censure? Ah, she is so unhappy, my little Antoinette, and, I have no power to help her! Oh my God! succor my persecuted child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sweet priestess of love! how truly thou art the interpreter of our, passion! For it is OURS, my Isabella, is it not? It is our love of which, we speak, not mine alone. I have confessed to thee; now do the same by, me. Tell me, my wife, didst thou hate the man to whom thy passive hand, was given, without one thought of thee or of thy heart's predilections?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a bold advocate of my people's claims,\\\" said she; \\\"a brave, defender of my Austria. I rejoice to know it, and never will take, umbrage at what you have so nobly spoken. But you have not convinced me;, my sorrow speaks louder than your arguments. You have termed me 'your, emperor.' I know why you have once more called me by that flattering, title. You wish to remind me that in mounting the throne of my ancestors, I lost the right to grieve as a woman, and pledged myself to gird on the, armor of manhood. Hitherto I have made it my pride to plan, to reign, to, fight like a man. I have always feared that men might say of me that my, hand was too weak to grasp the reins of power. But God, who perhaps gave, me the head of a man while leaving me the heart of a woman, has punished, me for my ambition. He has left me to learn that, alas! I am but a, woman--with all the weakness of my sex. It is that womanly heart which\\n\\nFrederick. If he should discover it, he might suppose that I, like the, rest of the world, am abashed in the presence of a king because he has, some military fame. No--no--what excites me is the fact that I am about, to write a bit of history; for this interview between Prussia and, Austria will be historical. It is the fate of Europe--that fate which I, hold in my hands, that stirs me with such unwonted emotion. This King of, Prussia has nothing to do with it. No doubt he hopes to hoodwink me with, flattery, but I shall work him to my ends, and force him to that line of, policy which I have long ago laid down for Austria's welfare.\\\"\\n\\nEvery one felt bound to speak a word of love or of admiration, and it, was only by dint of great exertion that the two footmen who preceded the, queen were able to open a small space through which she could pass. She, felt annoyed--even alarmed--and for the first time in her life regretted, the etiquette which once had required that the Queen of France should, not traverse the galleries of Versailles without an escort of her ladies, of honor.\\n\\nPotemkin took the etui and without opening it laid it on the table, beside him. \\\"Ah,\\\" said he, with a shrug, \\\"his majesty sends me the Black, Eagle. I am much obliged to him, but really I have so many orders that I, have nowhere left to wear them, and how to dispose of this new one I, scarcely know. See for yourself,\\\" continued he smiling, and pointing to, his breast, which indeed was covered with crosses, \\\"do I not look like a, vender of orders, carrying about his samples?\\\" [Footnote: All Potemkin's, own words. Dohm's Memoirs. vol. i., p 4l3]\\n\\n\\\"And I will keep my promise faithfully,\\\" replied the empress, reaching, him her hand. \\\"Nevertheless, I cling to the hope that you have, exaggerated the defects of the princesses, and that they are not, altogether as ugly as you have pictured them to me.\\\" [Footnote: This, conversation is historical, and the criticism of Count Dietrichstein, upon the two princesses, as here related, is almost verbatim. See, Wraxall's \\\"Memoirs,\\\" vol. ii., page 406.]\\n\\nHe turned away that she might not see the tears which had gathered in, his eyes and were ready to fall. As for Therese, she rose to her feet., For one moment, her heart stood still--the next, her blood was coursing, so wildly through her veins that she thought he must surely hear its mad, throbbings in the stillness of that little room. The emperor turned, again, and his face was grave, but calm. He had mastered his emotion\\n\\n\\\"Go, then, and the blessings of your fallen angel go with you! Play your, game cautiously, and let us hear the chink of Herr Eskeles Flies' gold, near the rustling of our fragile bank-notes. And now go. Return in half, an hour, that I may receive you in presence of our fastidious guests., They might not approve of this tete-a-tete, for you are said to be a sad, profligate, Carl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear friend, how I thank you for sparing me the sight of these, hideous rites! Your arrangements must have been exquisite, for I never, so much as suspected the thing. Fortunately, it is all over, and we can, enjoy ourselves as usual. Here, Philip. Let the house look festive:, flowers on the staircases and in the entrance-hall; oranges and roses in, the dining-room; vanilla-sticks in the coffee-cups instead of teaspoons., Away with you!\\\"\\n\\nThe princess had not been wedded by proxy; it was therefore necessary, that she should be married with the blessings of the church, before she, proceedcd in state to the throne-room to receive the homage due to her, as a queen. No time had therefore been given her to retire before the, ceremony, and she was married in her travelling-dress. At the entrance, of the chapel stood the new ladies in waiting of the Queen of Rome. One, of them relieved her of her hat, which the empress replaced by a wreath, of myrtle. Then Maria Theresa, having placed the hand of Josepha in that, of her son, the imperial cortege approached the altar.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried he, bitterly, \\\"how it will rejoice them to see me so weak, and sick! They will go home and tell their Hungarians that there is no, strength left in me to fight with traitors! But they shall not know it., I will be the emperor, if my life pay the forfeit of the exertion. Lead, me to the door, Gunther. I will lean against one of the pillars, and, stand while I give audience to the Magyars.\\\"\\n\\ntoo, looks upon Poland as the apple of Eris, and she has found it so, over-ripe that it is in danger of falling from the tree.

Meanwhile, should it burst, we will find means to prevent, it from soiling US. Now let us speak of Turkey. That unlucky Porte must, have something done for him, and while we mediate in his behalf, I hope, to bring about a good understanding between Austria and Russia. Let us, do our best to promote a general peace. Europe is bleeding at every, pore; let us bind up her wounds, and restore her to health.\\\"\\n\\nwho leaned against a pillar, fixed his eyes upon Therese with a glance, of supreme happiness. Therese returned the glance with one of such deep, trust and love, that no one who saw it could doubt her power of vision., The audience burst out into one simultaneous storm of applause, and this, reminded the young girl that she was not alone with her \\\"master.\\\" She, raised her eyes for the first time toward the spectators, and met every, glance directed toward herself.\\n\\n\\\"The fierce countess is about to be tamed,\\\" thought he. \\\"I shall win my, bet, and humble this insolent beauty. Let her rule if she must, until we, reach Paris; but there I will repay her, and her chains shall not be, light. Really, this is a piquant adventure. I am making a delightful, wedding-tour, without the bore of the marriage-ceremony, at the expense, of the most beautiful woman in Europe; and to heighten the piquancy of, the affair, I am to receive two thousand louis d'ors on my return to, Vienna. Here she comes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are resolved to speak of Poland,\\\" said Frederick, again taking so, large a pinch of snuff that it bedaubed not only his face, but his white, Austrian uniform. He brushed it off with his fingers, and shaking his, head, said: \\\"I am not neat enough to wear this elegant dress. I am not, worthy of wearing the Austrian livery.\\\" He then resumed: \\\"You interest, yourself in Poland. I thought that Polish independence had been thrown, to the winds. I thought, also, that your highness was of the same, opinion on this question as the Empress Catharine, who says that she, neither knows where Polish territory begins nor where it ends. Now I am, equally at a loss to know what is and what is not Poland, for in Warsaw, a Russian army seems to be perfectly at home, and in the south of Poland, an Austrian regiment affirms that they occupy Polish ground by command, of the Austrian government.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I beg you to believe, my verdant friend, that I never forget any, thing,\\\" said Kaunitz, somewhat haughtily. \\\"I am perfectly au fait to the, Russo-Prussian treaty; but I have not been invited to the banquet, and I, do not intend to go uninvited. When they speak, we will consider their, offers. If they say nothing, we go to war. If they speak, we will allow, ourselves to be persuaded to share the booty which we cannot restore to, its owners. In that way, we are in a manner forced into this coalition\\n\\nstudents, and civil officers of various grades. Almost every class found, some representatives in that brilliant assemblage; and each one felt, keenly the privilege he enjoyed in being present on that particular, occasion. But it was not altogether for the sake of the music that all, Paris had flocked to the opera. The Parisians were less desirous to hear, \\\"Iphigenia,\\\" than to see the emperor, who was to be there in company, with his sister.\\n\\nOn the other hand were Gluck and his friend Calzabigi, whose partisans, disdained the old style, and lauded the new one to the skies. Gluck was, perfectly indifferent to all this strife of party. Not once, since the, first day of rehearsal, had his countenance lost its expression of calm, and lofty security. Resolved to conquer, he receded before no obstacle., In vain had the prima donna, the renowned Gabrielle, complained of, hoarseness: Gluck blandly excused her, and volunteered to send for her, rival, Tibaldi, to take the role of Eurydice. This threat cured the, hoarseness, and Gabrielle attended the rehearsals punctually. In vain, had Guadagni attempted, by a few fioritures, to give an Italian turn to, the severe simplicity of Orpheus's air. At the least deviation from his, text, Gluck, with a frown, would recall the ambitious tenor, and do away, with his embellishments. In vain had the chorus-singers complained of, the impossibility of learning their parts. Gluck instructed them one by, one. He had trained the orchestra, too, to fullest precision; and, finally, every difficulty overcome, the great opera of \\\"Orpheus and, Eurydice\\\" was ready for representation on the birthday of the, Archduchess Isabella.\\n\\n\\\"Kusinski went on with his sword drawn over the king's head, although he, begged him for rest. But the king saw that Kosinski looked undecided and, uneasy, so as they came near to the Convent of Bielani, he said to, Kosinski, 'I see that you don't know which way to act, so you had, better let me go into the convent to hide, while you make your escape by, some other way.' But Kosinski said no, he had sworn to kill him. So they, went on farther, until they came to Mariemont, a castle belonging to the, Elector of Saxony. Here the king begged for rest, and they sat down and, began to talk. Then Kosinkski told the king he was not killing him of, his own will, but because he had been ordered to do so by others, to, punish the king for all his sins, poor fellow! against Poland. The king, then said it was not his fault, but all the fault of Russia, and at last, he softened the murderer's heart. Kosinski threw himself at the king's, feet and begged pardon, and promised to save him. So Stanislaus promised, to forgive him, and it was all arranged between them. They went on to a, mill near Mariemont, and begged the miller to let in two travellers who, had lost their way. At first the miller took them to be robbers, but, after a great deal of begging, he let them in. Then the king tore a leaf, out of his pocket-book, and wrote a note to General Cocceji. The, miller's daughter took it to Warsaw, not without much begging on the, king's part; and you can conceive the joy of the people when they heard, that the king was safe, for everybody seeing his cloak in the streets\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Maria Theresa, sternly, while her fiery eyes sought the, figure of her son, \\\"now we are alone, and Joseph is at liberty to speak., I beg him to remember, that in the person of his mother, he also sees, his sovereign, and that the empress will resent every word of disloyalty, spoken to the parent. And I hold it to be highly disloyal for my son to, accuse me of making sport of his hopes. I have not come to my latest, determination from cruelty or caprice; I have made it in the strength of, my maternal love to shield my child from sin, and in the rectitude of my, imperial responsibility to my people, who have a right to claim from me, that I bestow upon them a monarch who is worthy to reign over Austria., Therefore, my son, as empress and mother, I say that you shall remain., That is now my unalterable will. If this decision grieves you, be humble, and submissive; and remember that it is your duty, as son and subject\\n\\n\\\"But, Anna,\\\" cried the emperor, with a sudden burst of feeling, \\\"you, would rattler be obliged to the man whom you loved than to a stranger., Oh, if you but loved me, there would be no question of 'mine or thine', between us! It is said--I have betrayed myself, and I need stifle my, passion no longer; for I love you, beautiful Anna, I love you from my, soul, and, at your feet, I implore you to give me that which is above, all wealth or titles. Give me your love, be mine. Answer me, answer me., Do you love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will tell your highness. I had lost my young wife, the one I loved, best on earth, and I came to beg my discharge; for my longing was to go, back to my native mountains and live a hermit's life in Tyrol. My, empress would not release me. `How!' said she, 'are you so weak that you, must skulk away from the world because Almigthy God has seen fit to, bereave you of your wife? He tries your faith, man, and you must be, firm, whether you face the storm or bask in the sunshine. Did you not, promise to serve me faithfully, and will you now cast away your useful, life in vain sorrow? What would you think of me were I so lightly to, break my oath to my people--I who must lift my head above every tempest, of private sorrow, to fulfill my vow until death,' Thus spoke my, empress; but that was many years ago, and she was then sovereign of all, Austria.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go, Matuschka,\\\" said she, \\\"and take some rest. You have been laboring, for me all day, and I cannot bear to think that the only friend left me, in this world should be overtasked for me. Sometimes you look at me as, my mother once did; and then I dream that I feel her hand laid lovingly, upon my head, and hear her dear voice exhorting me to pray that God, would bless me with strength to do my duty to my bleeding country.\\\", Matuschka fell upon her knees and kissed the hem of her mistress's robe.\\n\\nwas hurrying from buffet to table, from table to kitchen, superintending, the servants. The cook was deep in the preparation of her roasts and, warm dishes; and at the kitchen door sat a little maiden, who, with, important mien, was selecting the whitest and crispest leaves from a, mountain of lettuce which she laid into a large gilt salad-bowl beside, her; throwing the others to a delighted pig, who, like Lazarus, stood by, to pick up the leavings of his betters. In the yard, at the fountain\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your majesty. The son of the dauphin is a noble youth, and, although his father was unfriendly to Austria, Choiseuil and La, Pompadour are for us. Marie Antoinette, therefore, is to be Queen of, France. This, however, must be a profound secret between ourselves., While her little highness is being fashioned for her future dignity, we, must marry her elder sisters, if not so brilliantly, at least as, advantageously as we can. First, then, upon the list is the Archduchess, Christina. We must find some suitable rank for herself and her husband\\n\\n\\\"Do you know,\\\" said he, \\\"what William the Silent once said of himself?, 'If I knew that my night-cap had found out my thoughts I would throw it, in the fire.' Now, Binder, do not aim to be my night-cap, or I shall, burn you to a cinder.--But enough of this. It would seem that the, Emperor Joseph expects me to wait upon him. Well--if it please him that, I should make the first visit, I will humor him. When a man feels that, he is lord and master of another, he can afford to be condescending! I, will indulge the emperor's whim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said she, aloud. \\\"No, it is not so. I am neither old nor ugly. The, light of youth has not yet fled from my brow. My beauty's sun has not, yet set forever. My Franz will love me still; and however charming, younger women may be, he will remember the beloved of his boyhood, and, we will yet be happy in reciprocal affection, come what may to us as, emperor and empress. I do not believe that he said he had never seen so, lovely a woman as Riccardo. Poor, dear Franz! He has a tedious life as, husband of the reigning sovereign. From sheer ennui he sometimes wanders, from his wife's heart, but oh! he must, he must return to me; for if I, were to lose him, earthly splendor would be valueless to me forever!\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor looked on and listened with an amused smile, highly diverted, at the avalanche of courtiers that came rushing on them from corridor, and staircase. Meanwhile the sovereigns pursued their way in solemn, silence until the brilliant throng had descended the marble stairs that, led from the terrace to the gardens. Then came another flourish of, trumpets, one hundred Swiss saluted the king, and twelve gardes de corps, advanced to take their places close to the royal promenaders.\\n\\nFor some time the poor young king sat in profound discouragement., Finally, with a long, weary sigh, he raised his head, and began to, reflect again. At last he solved he difficult problem. \\\"Ah!--I have it, now,\\\" thought he, heartily relieved. \\\"I will go to Madame Adelaide. She, was my mother's dearest friend and my father's favorite sister. She, shall be my counsellor. I believe that, with her assistance, I may, succeed in carrying out the policy dictated by my father.\\\"\\n\\ndishonored girl, she had slunk through the streets of Rome in search of, death--death and annihilation in the black waves of the Tiber. She felt, the waters engulf her, she heard her own death-cry, the last protest of, youth against self-destruction; and then she felt the grasp of, Podstadsky--Podstadsky who, in restoring her to the world, had laid a, new curse upon her life. Until then she had been luxurious, frivolous\\n\\nJust then the folding-doors were thrown wide open, and the steward, announced in a loud voice that the table of his lord the prince was, served. The company arose, and the ladies looked to see which of them, was to have the honor of being conducted to the table by the host., Kaunitz feigned neither to see nor to hear. He continued his, conversation with Noverre, and when he had quite done, he sauntered, carelessly up to his other guests. Suddenly he paused, and his eyes, wandered from one to another with a searching glance.\\n\\nBaron Binder looked after the page and shook his head. Kaunitz smiled., \\\"Enough of ambassadors for to-day. The ship of Austria lies proudly and, safely in the haven of her own greatness; and would you deprive the, pilot of a few hours of relaxation?

In fifteen minutes I await your highness here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What fables men do invent!\\\" exclaimed the king. \\\"A courier has just, arrived from the French embassy, in Vienna, with dispatches informing us, that Count von Mercy had received for your majesty one official letter, from the empress, and two private letters of instruction, one of which, contained a list of persons recommended by her majesty; and, finally, a, fourth missive, private, from the Emperor Joseph. And all this is pure, invention, Count von Mercy?\\\"\\n\\nThe empress heaved a sigh, and drew her mantilla over her face, as if to, shut out the future which was unrolling itself to her view. She felt, sick at heart; for she began to comprehend that her successor was not, only creating a new order of things, but was speaking with contempt of, his mother's reign. But she would not comtemplate the sad vision; she, strove to turn back her thoughts to the present.\\n\\n\\\"Which is beneath the dignity of the head of the church,\\\" interrupted, Pius. \\\"You can well imagine that I have already said as much to myself., I know, that in going to visit this proud man, I humble myself. But if, humility becomes any one of the servants of God, it becomes the, successor of Peter, and I have no right to shrink from personal, humiliation, when, perchance, it may win something from haughtiness in, favor of the church of God. Perhaps the advances I make to Kaunitz may, move his cold heart, and teach him to do unto others as others have done, unto him.\\\"\\n\\nCount Podstadsky was still in the elegant costume of the day. Graceful, and distinguished in his bearing, he leaned his weary body, against the, stake that supported the scaffold on which he was to suffer the last, degree of public infamy. But now the executioner approached, holding a, pair of large glistening shears. He gathered the soft brown curls of the, count in his rough grasp, and very soon the glossy locks fell, and there, remained nothing but the shorn head of the felon. This done, the, executioner drew off the gold-embroidered coat which became the young, nobleman so well, and threw over his shoulders the coarse smock, which\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sire; and it may be an hour of tribulation, unless your majesty, has the magnanimity to prevent it! To discourage idle assemblages, your, majesty has forbidden the people to follow funerals.

The police have done their best to disperse the, rioters, but so far in vain.\\\"\\n\\nThe emperor approached, and tenderly strove to lift his mother, while he, lavished words of love and comfort upon her. She allowed him to lead, tier to a divan, where gradually the tempest of her grief gave place to, deep-drawn sighs, and, finally, to peace. The crisis, however, was long, and terrible, for the affections of Maria Theresa were as strong as her, will; and fierce had been the conflict between the two.\\n\\nHe dreamed on, while his tired men slept. Not all, however, for, far, toward the left wing of the army, a band of hussars were encamped around, a wagon laden with brandy, and, having much more confidence in the, restorative powers of liquor than of sleep, they had been invigorating, themselves with deep potations. Another company of soldiers in their, neighborhood, awakened by the noisy mirth of the hussars, came forward, to claim their share of the brandy. It was refused, and a brawl ensued\\n\\nThe countess was superbly dressed. A rich robe of velvet, embroidered, with gold, fell in heavy, glistening folds around her graceful figure; a, diadem of brilliants sparkled like a constellation upon the blackness of, her luxuriant hair, and her exquisite neck and arms were covered with, costly gems. She had just completed her toilet for a dinner given by the, Princess Karl Liechtenstein, when Podstadsky had met her with the, alarming intelligence which had obliged her to send an excuse.\\n\\n\\\"There spoke my Lacy, my own gallant Austrian!\\\" exclaimed Joseph. \\\"To, work, then, to work!

Once in camp, I shall\\n\\n\\\"Oh, mother, my own imperial mother,\\\" said Christina, \\\"do not only free, me from the man whom I detest, but bless me with the hand of the man I, love. You well know how long I have loved Albert of Saxony, you know how, dear I am to him. I have sworn never to be the wife of another, and I, will keep my oath, or die! Oh, mother, do not make me the sport of, policy and ambition! Let me be happy with him whom I love. What are, crowns and sceptres and splendor, when the heart is without love and, hope? I am willing to lead a simple life with Albert--let me be happy in, my own way. Oh, mother! I love him so far above all earthly creatures\\n\\n\\\"I speak of those who hate me, because I will not join them in their, treachery toward my empress--of those who hold out to me gold and, diamonds, and who hate me because I will not sell my loyalty for pelf., Oh, I was flattered with orders and honors, promises and presents. But I, would not listen. What cared I for future security? What mattered it to, me that I was to be the victim of Paul's vengeance? I thought of you, alone; and more to me was the safety of your crown than that of my, worthless life! I was loyal and incorruptible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you sophist! Did you not say that I wore my title upon my brow? Did, you not tell me that I could not hide my majesty from the sons of men?, But I forgive you, and the boy also. Let us drink his health while we, enjoy his strawberries. Fill your glasses to the brim, and having done, honor to those who furnished our repast, allow me to propose--ourselves:, To the health of those who are about to eat a dinner which they have, earned by the sweat of their brow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And where you might realize your mother's touching dream of becoming a, boor, and repenting your sins in sackcloth and ashes! That maternal idyl, still troubles your poor, shallow brain, does it? For my part, I think, no spectacle on earth is so ridiculous as that of the repentant sinner., It is the most humiliating character in which a man can appear before, the world, and it is unworthy of you, Carlo. Hold up your head and look, this phantom of dancer in the face. It is but a phantom. The bright\\n\\nwhereon the lights, not yet extinguished, were dropping their waxen, tears from two lofty silver candelabra. At this table sat a man, looking, earnestly at a paper covered with notes of music. He had sat there the, whole night long, and his countenance gave no indication of the, exhaustion that follows upon night-watching. His large, dark, gray eyes, flashed whenever he raised his head thoughtfully, as he frequently did;, and when music was born of his thoughts, a smile illuminated his, otherwise plain face, and a wonderful light played about his magnificent, forehead; the glory of that genius which had made it her dwelling-place.\\n\\nSuddenly he ceased, and became very pale. He was sensible that he had, burst a blood-vessel, and he felt the warm stream of his life welling, upward, until it moistened his pallid lips. With a hasty movement he, drew out his handkerchief, held it for a moment before his mouth, and, then replaced it quickly in his bosom. Large drops of cold sweat stood, out from his brow, and the light faded from his eyes. But these haughty, Magyars should not see him fall! They should not enjoy the sight of his, sufferings!\\n\\nThe empress had started from her seat, and she now stood in the centre, of the room, earnestly gazing upon her husband and her child. Her, mother's heart beat wildly, and tears of tenderness suffused her eyes., She longed to speak some word of pardon to her son; but before all, things, Maria Theresa honored court ceremony. She would not, for the, world, that her subjects had seen her otherwise than self-possessed and, regal in her bearing.\\n\\nAt last the deep bells of St. Stephen's opened their brazen throats., This signified that the pope and the emperor were at the gates of the, city. The consent of the latter having been asked in the matter of the, bell-ringing, he had replied to Cardinal Megazzi: \\\"By all means. I, wonder you should ask me the question, when bells are the artillery of, the church.\\\" [Footnote: Friedel's Letters, vol. i., p. 213.]\\n\\nCoronini: you, whose loyalty is offended every time you address me as, Count Falkenstein. I only wonder that the sun did not hide its head, and, the earth tremble at the sacrilege! What do you suppose he called, me?--An ass! He did, I assure you. That little bare-legged boy called, his emperor an ass! Now, Coronini, do you think you can taste of the, strawberries that were gathered by those treacherous little hands?\\\"\\n\\nafter a pause, \\\"that I should still hear the language of courtly, falsehood? Awake, my friends, for this is not Austria's imperial, capital! It is the world which God created, and here upon our mother, earth we stand as man to mail. A little shining beetle is creeping on my, boot as familiarly as it would on the sabot of a base-born laborer. If, my divine right were written upon my brow, would not the insects, acknowledge my sovereignty, as in Eden they its golden wings and leave, me without a sign--Happy beetle! Would that I too had wings, that I, might flee away and be at rest!\\\"\\n\\nPrince Kaunitz stood in the centre of the room when the Russian minister, made his appearance. He raised his cold blue eyes with perfect, indifference to the smiling face of the Russian, who bowed low, while, his host vouchsafed him a slight inclination of the head. Prince, Gallitzin seemed to be as unconscious of this haughty reception as of, the fact that Kaunitz had not moved forward a singe step to greet him., He traversed with unruffled courtesy the distance that separated him, from Austria, and offered his hand with the grace of a finished, courtier.\\n\\nThe country was one vast desert. From every cottage went forth the wail, of hunger. The stalls were empty of cattle, the barns of corn. The, ploughs lay empty on the ground, for there was neither grain to sow nor, oxen to drive. There were neither men nor women to till the soil, for, there was no money to pay nor food to sustain them. Each man was alone, in his want, and each sufferer in the egotism of a misery that stifled, all humanity, complained that no one fed him, when all were fainting for, lack of food.\\n\\n\\\"You are a grown-up child, Binder; you stare, and believe every thing., Have you not yet learned that statesmanship recognizes nothing but, interests? To-day it is to the interest of Frederick to squeeze our, hands and protest that he loves us; to-morrow (if he can), he will put, another Silesia in his royal pocket. We, too, have found it convenient, to write him a love-letter or two; but to-day, if we would, we would, pluck off his crown, and make him a little margrave again! Our intimacy, reminds me of a sight I once saw while we were in Paris. It was a cage\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" replied the father, \\\"your majesty is about to rescue that beloved, son from destruction; but as your majesty is a loving mother, it, afflicts you to disappoint your child. Still, our Lord has commanded if, the right eye offend, to pluck it out; and so is it your majesty's duty, to pluck from your son's heart the evil growing there, even were his, heart's blood to follow. The wounds you may inflict upon your dear, child, for God's sake, will soon be healed by His Almighty hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" interrupted the emperor. \\\"You would not have me punish him for, being man enough to say to my face what thousands say of me behind my, back, would you? Now, I am so disinclined to punish him that I intend to, increase his pension just because he is an honest, plain-spoken fellow., You need not make such a grimace, Gunther. If you feel badly, console, yourself with your work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what, if another should execute what this Galician has conceived?\\\", continued the emperor, shuddering. \\\"What if, in his ignorance, another, one of these wild huntsmen should deem it his duty to take the life of, Frederick?\\\" The emperor grew pale with the thought, and his hand was, lifted as if to protest against the crime. \\\"I must find means to shield, myself from such disgrace, for his safety and my honor are cast on the, same die.\\\"\\n\\nyesterday, when the Countess Fuchs remonstrated with your highness, you, replied with an unseemly jest. You said, 'Dearest countess, I hope to, prove to you that, although I neglect my mass, I can be pious on the, battle-field. There, on the altar of my country, I mean to sacrifice, countless enemies, and that will be an offering quite as pleasing in the, sight of God.' Were those not your words, prince?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I accept the offer, and here is my hand. And so, hand in hand, we shall, conquer the world. God be praised, there is room enough for us both, and, we will divide it between us. Away with all little thrones and their, little potentates! Oh, friend, what joy it must be to dwell among the, heights of Olympus, and feel that all below is ours! I am intoxicated, with the dream! Two thrones--the throne of the Greek and the throne of, the Roman emperors; two people so mighty, that they dare not war with, one another; while, side by side, their giant swords forever sheathed\\n\\n\\\"The King of Prussia is asking succor from Russia. The empress is quite, ready to grant it, and has already marched an auxiliary force into, Galicia. But she exacts that her troops shall act independently of, Frederick, and requires of him for the prosecution of her war with, Turkey, a subsidy of two million of thalers. The king is indignant at, her exactions, so that the opportunity now offers to dissolve this, dangerous alliance. If the empress-queen could bring herself to pen a, letter to Catharine requesting her intervention--\\\"\\n\\nThirty persons, exclusive of Count Rosenberg and two other confidential, friends, accompanied the emperor. Of course, the incognito of a Count of, Falkenstein, who travelled with such a suite, was not of much value to, him; so that he had endured all the tedium of an official journey. This, was all very proper in the eyes of Maria Theresa, who thought it, impossible for Jove to travel without his thunder. But Jove himself, as, everybody knows, was much addicted to incognitos, and so was his terrene, representative, the Emperor of Austria.\\n\\nbowing. \\\"As to Poland, the great question there is to preserve the, balance of power. I beg, therefore, that Russia and Prussia will make, known at once the extent of their claims there, that Austria may shape, hers accordingly. I shall enter at once into correspondence with the, King of Prussia, to ascertain his views as to the future boundaries of, Poland. Two things are indispensable to insure the success of this, affair.\\\"\\n\\nThe visit of the emperor was drawing to a close. He had tasted to its, utmost of the enjoyments of the peerless city. He had become acquainted, with its great national institutions, its industrial resources, its, treasures of art and of science. The Parisians were enthusiastic in his, praise; from the nobleman to the artisan, every man had something to say, in favor of the gracious and affable brother of the queen. Even the, fish-wives, those formidable dames de la haile, had walked in procession, to pay their respects, and present him a bouquet of gigantic, proportions. [Footnote: On this occasion Madame Trigodin, one of the, most prominent of the poissurdes, made an address on behalf of the, sisterhood. Hubner, i., p. 151.]\\n\\nThe king laughed. \\\"I approve your policy,\\\" said he, \\\"but I am curious to, know how you would manage to prevent me from keeping my word. I am, certainly pledged to Russia, but I hope that the negotiations into which, we are about to enter will end in peace. I shall send a resume of our, conference to the empress, and use every effort to establish friendly, relations between you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And, yet, is ambitious to legislate. Oh, Catharine, beware of this old, king, who clings to you to support his own tottering royalty, and to, obstruct your schemes of conquest. But he will not succeed with you as, he has done by me. You have no mother to thrust you aside, while she, barters away your rights for a mess of pottage! I see your eagle, glance--it turns toward the south, where roll the stormy waves of the, Black Sea! I see this fair white hand as it points to mosques of, Constantinople, where the crescent is being lowered and the cross is, being planted--\\\"\\n\\nSince the intoxicating moment when Maria Theresa, in the presence of the, whole court, had named him co-regent, and delivered over to his hands, her vast empire, Joseph felt as if he had suddenly been transported to a, world of enchantment. He had, together with her ministers, dissuaded the, empress from her resolution of retiring to Innspruck; but even as he, joined his voice to theirs, his heart was trembling with fear lest she, should yield. He felt that if she revoked the power she had conferred\\n\\nHe began to write instructions for the use of his secretaries. They were, never to pronounce in his presence the two words DEATH and SMALL-POX. If, those words ever occurred in any correspondence or official paper that, was to come before his notice, they were to be erased. Those who, presented themselves before the prince were to be warned that these, fearful words must never pass their lips in his presence. A secretary, was to go at once to the Countess Clary, that she might prepare the, guests of the prince, and caution them against the use of the offensive, words. [Footnote: Hormayer, \\\"Austrian Plutarch,\\\" vol. xii., p. 374.]\\n\\nThe king shrugged his shoulders. \\\"And yet, it would appear that when, Zips lay at her feet, the Empress of Austria was ready to embrace it., But everybody grows eccentric when Poland is in question. My brother, Henry, who is in St. Petersburg, was one day discussing this matter of, the annexation of Zips with the empress. As Catharine, like myself, has, never had the privilege of examining the records in the court of, chancery at Vienna, she expressed some doubt as to the justice of, Austria's appropriation in that quarter. 'It seems,' said she, 'as if, one had noting to do but stoop down to pick up something in, Poland.'[Footnote: Ruthfore's \\\"History of Poland,\\\" vol. iv., p. 210.], Now, when proud Austria and her lofty Kaunitz condescend to stoop and, pick up, why shall not other people follow their example? I, too, shall, be obliged to march my troops into Poland, for every misfortune seems, about to visit this unhappy land. Who knows that in the archives at, Berlin there may not be some document to prove that I, also, have a, right to extend the lines of my frontier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have read your petition, and have found that you spoke the truth., From this day your father's pay falls to your mother; and at her death, it shall revert to you. I beg you both to forgive the tardiness of this, act of justice; for neither the empress nor I had ever heard that your, father had any family. Once more forgive us for all that you have, endured since his death. And now, my child, rise from your knees; for, human beings should kneel before God alone. Dry your tears, and hasten, to your mother. Tell her that the emperor is not as heartless as he has, been pictured to her by his enemies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Know my secret,\\\" said she, as she folded her hands and stood before her, outraged husband. \\\"And now hear me. A few months ago I had a beloved, brother, whom I loved the more that he was unfortunate and afflicted., From his childhood he had suffered from a malady which his physicians, called leprosy. The very servants deserted him, for it was said that the, disease was contagious. I loved my brother with devotion; I went to him, and nursed him until he died. God shielded me, for I did not take the, malady. But on my neck and back there came dark spots which, although, they are painful, are not contagious. My physicians tod me that my, strong constitution had rejected the leprosy, and these spots were a, regeneration of my skin, which would soon disappear. This, sire, is my, fatal secret; and now judge me. It is in your power to make me the, happiest of mortals, by granting me a generous pardon; but I will not, complain if you condemn and despise me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I waited so long for your majesty's regard, to earn it on account, of a silly peasant?\\\" said Kaunitz, with a bitter smile. \\\"I hope that I, shall have a niche in the temple of the world's esteem, even if I do, fail in finding the daughter of Conrad the boor. If your majesty has, never esteemed me before, you will not begin to do so today; and, as, regards your promised gratitude; the whole world knows, and your majesty, also knows, that I am not to be bribed; but I am ready, from the depths, of my own attachment to you, to do all that I can to help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have guessed,\\\" answered Maria Theresa, laughing. \\\"It is of your own, marriage that I would speak. I have accepted a crown for you, my, Caroline, and the ambassador who will conduct you to your kingdom is, already on his way. Your trousseau is magnificent and worthy of a queen., Your fair brow was made for a royal diadem, and in yonder room lies one, that is made up of a constellation of diamonds.\\\"\\n\\nand put my house in order. In that day I shall remember this interview, with the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\\" [Footnote: The two brothers never met, again. Although Leopold was next heir to the crown, Joseph would not, allow him to receive the title of King of Rome, but bestowed it upon, Leopold's son and heir, Francis. Even upon his death-bed the emperor, refused to see his brother. By his explicit commands, it was only when, his death had taken place, that a courier was sent to inform Leoold of, his accession to the throne.]\\n\\ntearful, despairing were these ghosts of an existence uncheckered by one, ray of happiness. Ah, with what a heart full of trembling hope had she, entered the walls of this palace, which to her had proved a prisoner's, cell! With what rapture had she heard the approaching step of that, high-born emperor, her husband, on their wedding-night; and oh, how, fearful and how swift had fallen the bolt of his vengeance upon her sin!, Memory whispered her of this.\\n\\nThe emperor laid his hands upon the shoulders of his friends, and looked, at them with unmistakable affection. \\\"Happy is the man who possesses two, such friends. But hear what I exact of you. I stand upon the threshold, of a new order of things. I am at last an emperor, free to carry out the, designs which for so many long years I have been forced to stifle in my, sorrowing heart. I am resolved to enlighten and to elevate my subjects., But if in my zeal to do well. I should lack discretion, it is for you to, check and warn me. And if I heed not your warnings, you shall persist\\n\\nTo-day the court was assembled in an apartment opening into the garden;, and the queen, who had just made her appearance in all the splendor of, her regal beauty, was the cynosure of attraction and of admiration. She, stood in the centre of the room, her eyes fixed wistfully upon the, setting sun, whose dying rays were flooding park, terrace, and even the, spot on which she stood, with a red and golden light. By her side stood, the king, his mild countenance illumined with joy and admiration of his, young wife's surpassing loveliness. On the other side of the queen were, the princes and princesses of the blood; and around the royal group an, assemblage of the youngest, prettiest, and sprightliest women of the, aristocracy, escorted by their cavaliers, young nobles whose rank\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty, I have had full time to reflect upon this weighty, question; for since first you announced your intention to resign the, throne, I have thought of nothing else. In politics we know neither, predilection nor prejudice. Necessity and interest decide all things., Your majesty has so often called me a good politician, that I have ended, by believing myself to be one. It follows thence that, in deliberating, upon this great question, I have laid aside all personal inclination and, sympathy, and have had in view the welfare of Austria alone. But for, this, the matter would have required no thought, for the Emperor Joseph, and I have nothing in common. He fears me, and I do not love him., [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Wrazall, vol. ii., p. 490.] We never, could be made to understand one another; for the language of the heart, is not to be forced by edicts, as is the language of the court. The, emperor has forbidden all tongues in Germany, save one. If he persist in, this, he will alienate his subjects, and Austria will soon lose her, greatness. When a titan intends to force his people to forget their, mother-tongue, he must do it by degrees; and if he succeeds, he will be, a skilful teacher. The best reforms are to be introduced through the, byways of life. If we trust them on the highway, they shock and terrify, the people. The young emperor, regardless of these considerations, has, violently suppressed whatever seemed injudicious to him in your, majesty's administration. Perhaps you had done too much; your son\\n\\n\\\"Unhappily for you, you know not what you claim,\\\" exclaimed the countess, angrily. \\\"Ask my uncle, ask his household, and they will tell you that I, am a tyrant, changing my will twenty times an hour; hating to-day the, thing I shall love to-morrow. You would aspire to be my husband, would, you? Have you no friends to warn you of the reefs upon which you are, running that poor little crazy bark of yours? Why the very people, as, they see me pass, tell of my frantic doings; and every child in Vienna, knows that I beat my servants, rage about my uncle's house like the foul, fiend, and dash through the streets on horseback like the Wild, Huntsman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord,\\\" said he, \\\"I have suffered cruelly since the sun rose to-day, but, oh! how I thank Thee that Thou hast preserved my name from eternal, infamy! How would the world have spurned me, if, refusing to give him, battle, I had taken the life of my enemy through the hands of an, Austrian soldier! My God! my God! the life of Frederick has become more, precious to me than my own--for HIS life is one with MY honor.\\n\\n\\\"Prince,\\\" said the signora, seriously, \\\"I learned the whole of this, scene from yourself; and in my relations with you I have followed the, example you gave me.

The whole, world knows of your double dealings with women, and calls you a, heartless young libertine.\\\"\\n\\nThe young countess took the arm of the prince, and they entered the, drawing-room. The guests had long been assembled there, but it never, occurred to Kaunitz to make any apology for his late appearance., Nevertheless, his guests were all noble; some of them representatives of, princely houses or powerful kingdoms. Kaunitz, however, was not only the, all-powerful minister of Maria Theresa; it was well known that his, slender, diamond-studded fingers directed the policy of all Europe. No, one in that room had the courage to resent his rudeness. All seemed to, feel honored as he walked haughtily forward with a slight inclination of, his head to the many, and a condescending smile to the few whom it, pleased him to distinguish by his notice.

You know nothing of the change, in your prospects--you have not as yet, received no orders to remain., Write to your mother, that, preferring to go without the grief of taking, leave, you have presumed to start tonight without her knowledge, hoping, soon to embrace her again, and lay your first-earned laurels at her, feet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"do not go. As commander-in-chief, you should be thoroughly acquainted, with the premises of our affair with Turkey, and you must hear both the, manifestoes which I an about to dictate. The first, of course, declares, war against the Porte. The second is, perhaps, a mere letter to the, successor of the great Frederick. His majesty of Prussia, foreseeing, in, his extreme wisdom, that I am likely to declare war against Turkey, is, so condescending as to offer himself as mediator between us!

Decide between us, and remember who it is that asks for, lodging here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have nothing further to tell, sire. As the king and his people left, my house, it was growing dark, so I slipped out. The curates were in the, churches with the women and children, and we men ran to the next, village, where the people gave us horses; and I have come to entreat the, emperor not to let the King of Prussia take us, as he did Silesia.\\\"\\n\\nTo-day she was even later than usual; and the king, who like other, mortals, was hungry after his walk, began to grow sulky at the delay., When at last she entered the room, he scarcely vouchsafed her an, inclination of the head as he rose to conduct her to the table. The, queen seemed not to perceive the omission. She gave him her hand with a, sweet smile, and despite his ill-humor, Louis could not suppress a throb, as he saw how brilliantly beautiful she was.\\n\\nThe three powers which had lived so long at variance, had united, themselves in one common cause--the pacification of Poland. In vain had, Stanislaus refused his assent to their friendly intervention. In vain, had he appealed to England and France for help. Neither of these powers, was willing, for the sake of unhappy Poland, to become involved in a war, with three nations, who were ready to hurl their consolidated strength, against any sovereign who would have presumed to dispute their joint, action.\\n\\n\\\"True,\\\" sighed the signora, \\\"and this great Kaunitz it is who has, abandoned me. While I worshipped the air he breathed, he sat at the feet, of the Countess Clary, repeating to her the self-same protestations with, which an hour before he had intoxicated my senses. Oh, when I heard, this, jealousy and despair took possession of my soul. I was resolved to, be revenged, and so I permitted the advances of Count Palffy. Ha! while, I endured his presence, I felt that my heart was wholly and forever, yours! Oh, my adored, my great Kaunitz, say that you love me, and at, your feet I throw all the lesser Kaunitzes in token of my fealty!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" exclaimed Frederick, laughing and nodding to Kaunitz, \\\"now I am, satisfied. If I would rather have Loudon beside me, I would rather have, the greatest statesman in Europe before me, for it is only when I can, see him that I feel quite safe from his diplomatic grasp. I take shelter, under your highness's eye. Be indulgent to an old soldier, whose sword, has so often been struck from his hands by your magic pen.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph opened the door, and, without a word, leaned upon his father's, arm, and traversed the long suite of apartments hung in black, until, they reached the room where lay the body of his wife. There, amid, burning wax-lights, was the hideous coffin that enclosed his beloved, one, and was about to bear away forever his life, his love, and his, happiness. When he saw the coffin, a stifled cry arose from his breast., He darted with open arms toward it, and, bending down, hid his face upon, the lid.\\n\\n\\\"Your highness, it is the impatience of a longing heart,\\\" said the, singer. \\\"Do you know that it seems to me a thousand years since last I, was allowed to enter these gates of Paradise! For eight days I have been, plunged in deepest sorrow, watching your carriage as it passed by my, house, snatching every note from my footman's hands in the hope that it, might be one from you--hoping in vain, and at last yielded myself up to, fell despair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all!\\\" cried Joseph.\\\" We must consult how we may soonest cast it, away from us. Your majesty will never require of me the sacrifice of, remaining bound to that woman. I obeyed your behest; and in spite of my, disinclination to a second marriage, I bent my will before the, necessities of diplomacy, and the command of my sovereign. But we are, now on a ground where the duty of a subject ends, and the honor of a man, stands preeminent. I never will consent to be the husband of this woman, whose person is disgusting to me. Far above all claims of political, expediency, I hold my right as a man.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph laughed. \\\"Dominick Kaunitz\\\" said he, \\\"you are the son of your, respected father, no doubt of it; for you behave prettily before the, bare walls themselves. But fear not, son of the mighty minister, MY walls, are dumb, and nobody is near to tell tales.

I fear that the persuasions of the handsome Francis of Lorraine, may outweigh her own convictions of right.

He let in the general, and there on, the floor, in the miller's shirt, lay the king fast asleep. So Cocceji, went down on his knees and kissed his hand, and called him his lord and, king, and the people of the mill, who had never dreamed who it was, all, dropped on their knees and begged for mercy. So the king then forgave, everybody, and went back to Warsaw with Cocceji.

If you are willing to be, rid of so dangerous a man, my life is at your disposal: but if you must, temporize with him, I do nothing to further measures which are to be, carried out by flattery and hypocrisy.\\\"\\n\\napprehends war with Russia, understands that if Austria is to befriend, him, she must put her army upon a war footing. If Austria is to do this, for the sake of Turkey, Turkey of course must furnish the means. The, Porte then, in the course of the next eight months, will pay us the sum, of twenty thousand purses, each containing five hundred silver piasters., Four thousand purses will be paid down as soon as the treaty is signed.\\\", [Footnote: Dohm, \\\"Memoirs of My Time,\\\" vol. i., p. 471.]\\n\\nand was mortgaged to Poland. We intend to resume our property and pay, the mortgage in the usual way. This is not at all to the point. We speak, of the fate of Poland. As for Austria, she aims at nothing but her, rights; and as soon as the Empress of Russia withdraws her troops from, Polish ground, we will withdraw ours, as well as all pretensions, whatever to the smallest portion of Polish territory.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shut the door, Potemkin, close the portiere, for in good sooth I know, not whether I am about to laugh or cry. I feel as if I had been hearing, a fable in which all my schemes were transformed into card houses, and, were blown away by the wind! But indeed I must laugh! The good King of, Prussia! Only think, Gregory, an offensive and defensive alliance with, Turkey. Is it not enough to make you laugh until you cry?\\\"\\n\\npending our diplomatic correspondence, he will not attack our armies. I, therefore hope that you, my son, will concede as much, and scrupulously, avoid all collision that might interrupt our negotiations. I send you, copies of our correspondence, and will continue to do so regularly., Hoping that God in His goodness will restore to me my imperial son, I, remain now as ever, your affectionate mother and empress, \\\"MARIA, THERESA.\\\"\\n\\nThe empress smiled kindly upon the speaker. \\\"I know that you are, inclined to religion,\\\" said she, \\\"and I am glad that you have had so, good an influence over the Countess Julia, for she is not wont to be too, zealous at prayer. I will remember you both for your piety, dear, children and will see that you are both well married. There is the young, Baron of Palmoden and Count--\\\"\\n\\nbut the grace and abandon of her attitude, as she leaned back in her, velvet arm-chair. She had not long been seated when the door of the box, opened, and a young man entered whom the lady greeted with a cordial, smile. Every one knew the visitor to be Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein., the richest, haughtiest, and handsomest cavalier in all Vienna., Podstadsky was the son of a distinguished nobleman, high in the, emperor's favor; he had just returned from his travels, and all the, Viennese gallants were eager to imitate him in every thing. To see him, in the box of the beautiful stranger was to fire the ambition of every, man to know her; the more so that the haughty Podstadsky, instead of, accepting a seat, was standing in an attitude of profound respect, which, he maintained until he took his leave.\\n\\nyou are the last love of an unfortunate man, whom the world calls an, emperor, but who lies at your feet, as the beggar before his ideal of, the glorious Madonna! Bend to me, Madonna, and let me drink my last, draught of love! I shall soon have quaffed it, and then--your father, will be here to remind me that you are a high-born countess, the, priceless treasure of whose love I may not possess! Kiss me, my Therese\\n\\n\\\"I believe that you are the man for Austria,\\\" said she. \\\"I believe that, together we can carry out our plans and projects. God grant that they be, righteous and just in His sight! You have read my heart, and you know, that I can never reconcile myself to the loss of Silesia. You know that, between me and Frederick no harmony can ever exist; no treaty can ever, be signed to which he is a party. [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words.], I will take the hand of France, not so much for love of herself as for, her enmity to Prussia. Will you work with me to make war on Frederick if, I appoint you sole minister, Kaunitz? For I tell you that I burn to, renew my strife with the King of Prussia, and I would rather give him, battle to-day than to-morrow.\\\" [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words., Coxe.]\\n\\nThe duke was entirely alone. He had dismissed his attendants, and now, stood in the centre of the room, awaiting his daughter in gloomy, silence. His cold, stern features had grown more repulsive than ever to, the unhappy girl; his piercing eyes more revengeful; his thin, pale lips, more cruel. He seemed to her a pitiless stranger, and she could not, advance to meet him. Powerless and faint, she stood at the door; all her, strength gone.\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" exclaimed the emperor. \\\"He who is not ashamed of the crime will, not be ashamed of the disgrace. If, for the sake of his rank, a man is, to have the privilege of being a villain, where, then, is justice?, [Footnote: Ibid.] Not another word of this! My forbearance is exhausted;, for I have sought by every means to convince you that, as a sovereign, I, shall show partiality to no order of men. Podstadsky and Szekuly shall, suffer to the full extent of the law, for the worth of their ancestors, cannot wipe out their own unworthiness.\\\"\\n\\nThese ordinances did away with the influence of the head of the church, in Austria, but they did not sufficiently destroy that of the clergy, over their flocks. This, too, must be annihilated; and now every thing, was ready for the great final blow which was to crush to the earth every, vestige of church influence within the dominions of Joseph the Second., This last stroke was the dispersion of the religious communities. Monks, and nuns should be forced to work with the people. They were no longer, to he permitted to devote their lives to solitary prayer, and every, contemplative order was suppressed.\\n\\n\\\"If your majesty does that, a war with France will be the consequence of, your frankness. France has promised succor to the Confederates, and has, already sent Dumouriez with troops, arms, and gold. France is longing to, have a voice in the differences between Russia and Turkey, and she only, awaits cooperation from Austria to declare openly against Russia. She, will declare against ourselves, if, after your majesty's promises, we, suddenly change front and take part against the seditious Poles.\\\"\\n\\nbecause free from the prejudices of religion, will belong to enlightened, Prussia; the southern half, the bigoted Catholic portion, that which, believes in the pope and his Jesuits, may perhaps adhere to Austria., Then comes revolution. Prussia will have for her allies, not only, northern Germany, but Sweden, England, Holland, Denmark, even Russia., Every step she takes in advance will drive back Austria; and the day may, come when Prussia, our powerful enemy, will seek for the Margrave of, Brandenburg the crown of the Kaisers.\\\"\\n\\nWhen he recovered from the violence of the fall, he found himself, unhurt, but alone. Not one of his suite was to be seen; in the mad rush, of the men for the crossing, they had been parted from him. The little, rustic bridge bad fallen in, and those who remained behind had rushed, with frantic yells in search of some other crossing. The emperor could, hear their cries in the distance, and they filled his heart with anguish, inexpressible.\\n\\n\\\"But a successor who will overturn all that his mother has done for, Austria's welfare. Your majesty laid the foundations of Austria's, greatness. To that end you called me to the lofty station which I now, occupy. Remember that together we pledged our lives and love to Austria., Be not untrue to the covenant. In the name of that people which I then, represented, I claim from their emperor, Maria Theresa, the strict, fulfilment of her bond. I call upon her to be true to her duty as the, ruler of a great nation, until the hand of God releases her from her, crown and her life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would that you spoke the truth!\\\" returned Isabella sadly. \\\"Had my heart, been capable of loving, I would have loved him long ago--him, whose, noble and confiding love is at once my pride and my grief. Believe me, when I tell you that in these few years of married life I have suffered, terribly. I have striven with my sorrows, I have tried to overcome the, past, I have desired to live and to enjoy life--but in vain. My heart, was dead, and could not awake to life--I have only suffered and waited, for release.\\\"\\n\\nAn angry murmur was heard, and every eye looked defiance at the emperor., \\\"Ah,\\\" said he, scornfully, \\\"you would ape the Polish diet, and dispute, the will of your king! You remember how the King of Poland succumbed to, dictation! I am another and a different man, and I care neither for your, approbation nor for your blame. It is my purpose to make Hungary, prosperous, and therefore I have abolished the feudal system which is, unfavorable to the development of the resources of the country. You, Magyars would interfere with me. You have a constitution at variance, with my laws, and for the sake of a piece of rotten parchment three, hundred years old, Hungary must be suffered to remain uncivilized, forever! Away with your mediaeval privileges and rusty escutcheons! A, new century has dawned, and not only the nobly born shall see its light\\n\\nFrom her cabinet council the empress passed at once to her private, apartments. When business was over for the, day, she loved to cast the, cares of sovereignty behind, and become a woman--chatting with her, ladies of honor over the \\\"on dits\\\" of the court and city. During the, hours devoted to her toilet, Maria Theresa gave herself up unreservedly, to enjoyment. But she was so impetuous, that her ladies of honor were, never quite secure that some little annoyance would not ruffle the, serenity of her temper. The young girl whose duty it was to read aloud, to the empress and dress her hair, used to declare that she would sooner, wade through three hours' worth of Latin dispatches from Hungary, than, spend one half hour as imperial hair-dresser.\\n\\n\\\"Rebellion in Tyrol, in Hnngary, in the Netherlands!\\\" murmured the, emperor, when he found himself alone. \\\"From every side I hear my, death-knell! My people would bury me ere I have drawn my last sigh. My, great ancestor, Charles, stood beside his open grave, and voluntarily, contemplated his last resting-place; but I! unhappy monarch, am forced, into mine by the ingratitude of a people for whom alone I leave lived!, Is it indeed so? Must I die with the mournful conviction that I have, lived in vain? O my God, what excess of humiliation Thou hast forced, upon me! And what have I done to deserve such a fate? Wherein have I, sinned, that my imperial crown should have been lined with so many cruel, thorns? Is there no remedy? must I drink this last bitter chalice? Must, I revoke that which I have published to the world as my sovereign will?\\\"\\n\\nmy lord and emperor,\\\" said he, \\\"I had heard of tears of joy, but, until, to-day, I knew not what they meant. I have been scourged for refusing to, kneel to my lord; but I bend the knee to you for I feel that you are a, mighty sovereign and a merciful father to your people. God bless you for, the words by which you have recognized our right to live and to be, free!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you hold them with unbecoming language,\\\" replied the empress, who, did not at all relish the tone of the King of Rome. \\\"And let me tell, you, my royal son, that an upright and honorable prince thinks less of, his rights as a man than of his duties as a ruler. He strives, while a, prince, to be a man; and while a man, to sacrifice his inclinations to, the calls of a princely station.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your majesty is pleased to speak of the county of Zips. Zips has always, belonged to Hungary. It was mortgaged by the Emperor Sigismund to his, brother-in-law ZVladislaw Jagello for a sum of money. Hungary has never, parted with her right to this country; and, as we have been compelled to, send troops to our frontier to watch Russia, the opportunity presents, itself for us to demonstrate to Poland that Austria can never consent to, regard a mortgaged province as one either given or sold. Zips belongs to, Austria, and we will pay back to the King of Poland the sum for which it, was mortgaged. That is all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If ingratitude do not blind it to truth. It is hard to find daylight in, the labyrinth of established faith. I, too, have wandered in this, labyrinth, but in all my divarications I sought for Truth. With, passionate longing I called her to my help. Far removed from the hum of, human imbecility, down among the solitudes of untrodden forests I sought, her. Here I was face to face with Nature, and listened for response to, the anxious questionings of my restless heart. It was well for me that, the trees were the only witnesses of my agitation, for my fellow-men\\n\\nHer father affected not to hear her. \\\"Yes,\\\" continued he, \\\"she will, verify my promise, and take the husband I have chosen. This marriage, will be a fine thing for both parties, for I give my daughter one-half, million of florins, and Baron von Meyer gives his son a million cash, down. Then the father-in-law gives three hundred florins a month for, pin-money, and I seven hundred; so that Rachel has a thousand florins a, month for her little caprices, and of this she is to render no account., That is a pretty dower for a bride. I give my daughter a trousseau equal, in magnificence to that of a princess. Upon her equipage, the arms of, our two houses are already emblazoned, and to-morrow four of the finest, horses in Vienna will conduct the Baroness von Meyer to her husband's, palace. I congratulate you, baroness. No Christian woman in Vienna shall, have an establishment like yours.\\\"\\n\\nThe other was a tall, gaunt man, in the dress of court maestro de, capello. His lean face was proud and serious, his large mouth wore an, expression of scorn, and his full-orbed, light-blue eyes had a glance of, power which accorded well with his lofty stature. The two advanced arm, in arm toward the railing, and, at their appearance, a storm of applause, arose from the parterre, while the partisans of the Italian school, cried; \\\"Long live Hasse! Long live Metastasio!\\\"\\n\\nWhether Frederick had intended to prove to his officers that he was as, bold a horseman as ever, or whether be had yielded to a momentary, impulse of anger, he suffered keenly for his bravado; for at every bound, of the horse, his agony increased. Finally he could endure no more. He, came to a complete stand, and requested his suite to slacken their pace., They rode on in perfect silence, the officers casting stolen glances at, the king, whose lips quivered, while his face grew every moment paler, with suppressed anguish. But he bore it all without a sigh, until they, had reached the point for which they started. Having accurately surveyed, it, Frederick turned his horse's head, and rode back to his quarters.\\n\\nhe bowed again and passed on. But his face no longer wore its expression, of careless gratification. He grew absent and thoughtful; he forgot to, return the greetings of the people; and vainly the ladies, who crowded, window and balcony, threw flowers in his way, or waved their, handkerchiefs in greeting. He saw nothing but the beautiful vision in, the black veil, and wondered whence she came and what could be the, hidden meaning of the red and white flowers which she wore and gave to, him.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, my son,\\\" cried the empress, surveying the beautiful suite, \\\"you, have decorated these rooms with the taste and prodigality of a woman. It, adds much to my enjoyment of their beauty to think that all this is the, work of your loving hands. But one thing has my princely son forgotten;, and therein he betrays his sex, showing that he is no woman, but in very, truth a man.\\\"\\n\\nHe threw his arms around her, and pressed his hot, parched lips to hers., Again she disengaged herself, and her musical laugh rang out upon the, stillness--clear, merry, silvery as ever. \\\"Die! Are you tired of, pleasure? I am not. I shall yet have many an intoxicating draught from, its golden beaker. Die! As if we knew what came after death! But come; I, pity your state of mind, and since you can no longer be happy in Vienna\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, if your majesty works as you have done of late, your chance, for life is not very great. You seem to forget that mind is subordinate, to matter--not matter to mind--that physical nature must have her, rights, and no man can withstand her exactions. Pardon me these bold, words, sire, but if I speak at all, I must speak the truth. You have, begun a gigantic edifice, and if you die, it must remain forever, incomplete.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall make good use of it, too. Our coffers need replenishing, and, the emperor will rejoice to see them filled with the gold of the, infidel. It will enable him to raise and equip a gallant army, and that, will give him such unbounded delight that we are sure of his signature., Besides this, the Porte presents us with a goodly portion of Wallachia;, he fixes the boundaries of Transylvania to our complete satisfaction\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my beloved!\\\" murmured she, \\\"you hope every thing from the, magnanimity of the emperor. But in what blessed clime was ever a Jewess, permitted to wed with a Christian? The emperor may remove the shackles, of our national bondage, but he can never lift us to social equality, with the people of another faith. There is nothing to bridge the gulf, that yawns between my beloved and me. It would kill my father to know, that I had renounced Judaism, and I would rather die than be his, murderer. Oh, my father! oh, my lover! My heart lies between you, and, yet I may not love you both!--But which must I sacrifice to the other?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All this has no reference to Austria,\\\" objected the emperor. \\\"We had, nothing to do with the selection of the king--nothing to do with the, projects of dismemberment. They were resolved upon, with or without our, sanction, and the law of self-preservation demands that if we cannot, prevent, we must endeavor to profit by them. I know that the partition, of Poland has an appearance of gross outrage which is obvious to every, eye; while the stringent necessity which has driven Austria to, participate in it is known to few. I confess that I would be grieved if, the world should misjudge me on this question; for I try, both in public, and private life, to be an honest man; and I believe that honesty in, statesmanship is the wisest and soundest policy. [Footnote: The, emperor's own words. See Raumer, \\\"Contributions,\\\" &c., Vol. iv., p., 539.] We could not do otherwise than we have done, and now, with the, full conviction of the exigency which has called for the act, I repeat, my question to your majesty, have you signed the act, or will you be so, kind as to sign it now?\\\"\\n\\nThe people seemed wild with joy, and nobody vouchsafed a thought to the, memory of the \\\"Bien-aime,\\\" whose body was even now being taken to its, last rest, in the vaults of St. Denis. The funeral train was any thing, but imposing. The coffin, placed upon a large hunting-wagon, was, followed by two carriages, containing the Duke d'Ayen, the Duke, d'Aumont, and two priests. Twenty pages and as many grooms closed the, procession, which went along without attracting the notice of anybody., The burial-service was read in the crypt, and the coffin hastily lowered, in the vault, which was not only walled up, but cemented also, for fear, the infection imprisoned within might escape from the dungeon of the, dead and infest the abodes of the living.\",\n          \"Ten minutes later the crowd was on the way to the river, to a dock, where lay the motor-boat. It was not a very elegant craft, but it had, a good engine and could travel well--and that, just then, meant, everything to the Rover boys. A bargain was struck for the run, and, the boys and the owner got aboard. And then the search for the, schooner was begun anew.\\n\\nA short while later an alarming thing occurred. The boys were out in, the Dartaway when they met Grace on the road and learned that Dora and, Nellie had been abducted by Josiah Crabtree, Tad Sobber, and some of, their other old enemies. They gave chase in the biplane, and, after, several adventures, located the girls in a lonely mansion in the, country, where they were prisoners, in charge of Sobber's aunt The, boys at once went for the authorities, and, after something of a, fight, the rascals were made prisoners, and the girls were rescued and, taken back to the Seminary.\\n\\nFollowing the sending out of the invitations to the wedding, presents, had come in thick and fast to the Stanhope home. From Dick's father, came an elegant silver service, and from his brothers a, beautifully-decorated dinner set; while Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, contributed a fine set of the latest encyclopaedias, and a, specially-bound volume of the uncle's book on scientific farming! Mr., Anderson Rover also contributed a bank book with an amount written, therein that nearly took away Dora's breath.\\n\\nThere were two matters of importance--the irrigation scheme and the, purchase of a large tract of land which would be benefited by the flow, of water, when the irrigation plant was put into operation. In both of, the schemes the Rovers held large interests--that is, they held what, were called options, for which Anderson Rover had put up large sums of, money, and he had likewise induced some friends to let him put up, money for them. In order to clinch their hold on the two business, propositions Anderson Rover must sign certain papers and have them, delivered to the right parties inside of the next three days. Should, he fail to do this, then his options on the property would terminate\\n\\n\\\"Um! Nervous, eh? Well, a few days of quietness will remedy that,\\\", answered the lawyer. \\\"Now, see here.\\\" He looked wisely at the three, Rovers. \\\"Our railroad disclaims all responsibility for this accident., But at the same time we--er--we want to do the right thing, you, know--rather do that than have any unpleasant feelings, understand?, Now if you are willing to accept our offer, we'll fix this matter, right up and say no more about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow morning?\\\" Tom heard him ask \\\"What time? Ten o'clock. That, is rather early, but I can go there directly from my home.\\\" There came, another pause. \\\"Leave that to me,\\\" cried the man. \\\"I'll make him do, it!\\\" He paused again. \\\"I am not afraid of those boys,\\\" he added. \\\"I'll, be there, sure.\\\" Another pause. \\\"Yes, the boat is the best place., Nobody can disturb us there. Good-bye.\\\" And then the man hung up the, telephone receiver.\\n\\n\\\"The two brokers are in that room,\\\" whispered Dick, pointing to the, door of the apartment. \\\"They are planning to skip out to Canada and, leave their affairs in the hands of the lawyer who has rented this, apartment. He is almost as much of a rascal as any of them, for he is, to take their power of attorney dated some days back, and is going to, try to prove an alibi for them. I heard 'em arrange the whole thing.\\\"\\n\\nHe and Jesse Pelter hustled Anderson Rover back, and then the boys saw, their father disappear from view. Swiftly the tug and the schooner, gathered headway. The boys shouted in vain. They looked around for, some other boat to come to their aid, but none was in sight. Then the, schooner passed down the Hudson River and the Rover boys were left in, the rowboat, gazing at each other in dismay.\\n\\nIt must not be thought that in those days the girls at Hope Seminary, were forgotten. Whenever the Rover boys got a chance they visited the, place, and many a nice time they and the girls had together. On those, occasions Dick and Dora would roam off together, the others making no, attempt to follow them, and the pair would plan the many things they, hoped to do in the future.\\n\\n\\\"I've got the front room all ready for you,\\\" went on the aunt. And she, led the way into the house and to the apartment in question. Here the, sufferer was put to bed, and his aunt did all in her power to make him, comfortable. The local doctor had already been notified, and soon he, appeared, to read a note written by the city specialist and listen to, what Sam had to tell him. Then he took charge and said Tom must be, kept very quiet.\\n\\nHe had already given the particulars of how he had been kidnapped, while on his way to meet Japson. The broker had come up accompanied by, the disguised Crabtree, and he had been forced into a taxicab and a, sponge saturated with chloroform had been held to his nose. He had, become unconscious, and while in that condition had been taken to some, house up in Harlem. From there he had been transferred to the Ellen, Rodney on the evening before the boys had discovered his whereabouts.\\n\\nThis term at Putnam Hall was followed by a long journey on land and, sea, to a far-away island of the Pacific, where the boys and their, friends had to play \\\"Robinson Crusoe\\\" for a while. Then they returned, to this country, and, in a houseboat, sailed down the Ohio and the, Mississippi Rivers. After leaving the Mississippi they took an outing, on the plains, and then went down into southern waters, where, in the, Gulf of Mexico, they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.\\n\\n\\\"Not exactly, Dora--and yet I don't think I am exactly fitted for a, professional career. That seems to be more in Tom and Sam's line. I, like business, and I'd enjoy getting into something big, something, worth while. I think I could handle those matters, if father would, only let me try. And then there is another thing, Dora,\\\" went on the, youth, looking squarely into his companion's face. \\\"Perhaps you can, guess what that is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After a while Pelter and Japson came to me and said they must come up, the river--that a sister of the crazy man lived up here, and they, must visit her before they went down the coast. I was suspicious, but, what could I do? I had chartered my vessel and I had my money, so I, obeyed orders. Then we came up here as fast as we could. The steam tug, was dismissed, and we came ashore to this place. Then they hired an, auto and went off--and that's all I know about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to leave you out--I want you to be doing something, else, for we have no time to lose in this matter. I want you, Sam, to, come with me, and when I go into the offices, I want you to hang, around outside and watch for old Crabtree. If he is in league with the, brokers he may be looking for a chance to interview them, but he will, be on his guard, knowing that we are here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get a chance to listen. As I was coming up I saw the first, man give the second man some money. Then the second man looked up and, saw me, and shoving the money into his pocket, he dove across the, street and into the crowd. That made me feel sure it was Crabtree, and, I ran after him pell-mell. I followed him for about half a block. But, the crowd was too much for me, and he got away. I was going to tell a, policeman, but then I thought he couldn't do any more than I could\\n\\nFour days later the youngest Rover got permission from the specialist, who had attended Tom to take him home. An easy-riding automobile was, procured, and in this the two brothers drove to the nearest railroad, station. A compartment in a parlor car had already been engaged, and, Tom was placed in this and made as comfortable as circumstances, permitted. The ride was a long and tedious one for the youth, and by, the time he had made the necessary changes to get to Oak Run he was, pretty well exhausted, and had a severe headache.\\n\\nand also a full supply of table and other linen. From Captain Putnam, came a handsome morris chair, and Songbird sent in a beautifully-bound, volume of household poetry, with a poem of his own on the flyleaf. The, students of Brill sent in a fine oil painting in a gold frame, and the, girls at Hope contributed an inlaid workbox with a complete sewing, outfit. From Dan Baxter, who had been invited, along with the young, lady to whom he was engaged, came two gold napkin rings, each suitably, engraved. Dan had written to Dick, saying he would come to the wedding, if he had to take a week off to get there, he being then in Washington, on a business trip.\\n\\nDuring the past year a room had been added to the house and this was, used as a library and sort of office combined, being provided with a, substantial safe and two roller-top desks. One of the desks was used, exclusively by Anderson Rover for his private letters and papers. When, sick the man had given Dick the extra key to the desk, telling him to, keep it. The father trusted his three sons implicitly, only keeping to, himself such business affairs as he thought would not interest them.\\n\\nAlarmed, Tom picked up the tall, thin form and carried the man into, the house, for it was still raining, although not as hard as before., He placed Crabtree on an old couch in the sitting room and, getting, some water, laid a wet cloth over his bruised and swelling forehead., Knowing but little about broken limbs, he did not attempt to do, anything for the broken leg but placed that member out in a somewhat, straight position. He called up to Dick and told his brother of what, had happened.\\n\\nThe talk in the apartment went on, covering the things Belright Fogg, was to do while Pelter and Japson were in hiding in Canada. The, unscrupulous lawyer was to produce a power of attorney dated some days, before, so that he might act in place of the brokers. He was also to, do his best to help the brokers prove an alibi when accused of the, abduction of Anderson Rover.\\n\\nThe wedding was to take place at high noon, and long before that time, the many guests began to assemble at the church. Among the first to, arrive was Captain Putnam, in military uniform, and attended by about, a dozen of the Hall cadets. George Strong, the head teacher, was also, present, for he and Dick had always been good friends. Then came the, students from Brill, all in full dress, and led by William Philander, Tubbs, bedecked as only that dudish student would think of bedecking, himself.\\n\\nA discussion lasting the best part of half an hour ensued. The aviator, went up to four hundred dollars and then to four hundred and fifty., Finally, Dick said he would accept five hundred dollars cash; and the, bargain was concluded at that figure. The money was paid over, and the, Rover boys gave the purchaser a bill of sale, and he departed without, delay, stating he wished to make arrangements for shipping the wrecked, biplane away.\\n\\nSam and Tom got aboard and willing hands grasped the propellers and, gave each a twist. Bang! bang! bang! went the explosions, and soon the, propellers were revolving swiftly, and then with a swoop the Dartaway, ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose in the air. A, cheer went up, and the students threw up their caps. Then Dick swung, around in a quarter circle and headed directly for Plankville.\\n\\nYears before, and while their father was in Africa, the three boys had, been sent by their uncle to Putnam Hall Military Academy, as related, in detail in the first volume of this series, called \\\"The Rover Boys, at School.\\\" At the Hall they had made a number of friends, including, Songbird Powell and the dudish student, William Philander Tubbs. They, had also made some enemies, who did their best to bring the Rover boys, to grief, but without success.\\n\\nRunning along in the air is a different proposition from running on, the ground, and the air-man has to be careful about the lay of the, land below him or he will soon go astray from his course. The earth, looks altogether different when viewed from the sky from what it does, when looked at from a level, and when an air-man is five or six, hundred feet up he has all he can do to make out what is below him.\\n\\n\\\"I said this morning I had an idea, Tom,\\\" answered his big brother. \\\"I, don't know whether it will work out or not, or if you'll care to try, it. You know I told you to go to Central Park while Sam and I went, down to those offices. I did that so that those brokers wouldn't see, you. They don't know you, and you can go down and interview them as a, stranger. Do you catch the idea?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the Dartaway is gone--our dear old flying machine!\\\" groaned Tom., \\\"The machine we hoped to fly in to Washington, to the next, inauguration. Why, don't you know that the planes of that machine were, covered with the autographs of most of the big men of this country?, Whenever we sailed around to visit our friends or the big men we had, them write their autographs on the canvas wings of the machine. Those, autographs alone were worth about a million, more or less!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, something is bound to happen to those boys!\\\" murmured the aunt., \\\"You simply can't hold them in!\\\" And something did happen, and what is, was will be related in the next volume of this series, to be entitled:, \\\"The Rover Boys in Alaska; Or, Lost in the Fields of Ice.\\\" In that, book we shall learn how Tom suddenly lost his mind and wandered away, from home, and what strenuous things happened to Dick and Sam when, they went after their brother.\\n\\nfor a few days later William Philander and Clarabel Ruggles were seen, out driving together and apparently as friendly as over. The dudish, student had sent the young lady a letter stating he thought some of, his fellow collegians had doctored the box of candy, and this, explanation was accepted by the girl and her aunt. Then William, Philander sent the girl some candy he was sure was all right, and also, a big bouquet of roses; and that was the end of the unpleasantness.\\n\\nAfter that the captain was quite willing to talk, and he told how, Crabtree and Japson had come to him and questioned him about the, schooner, and finally chartered the craft for a week. They had at, first wanted to pay him at the end of the time, but he had insisted, upon receiving his money in advance and it was then paid over. He had, been told that the strange man was Crabtree's brother, who had gone, crazy because of the loss of his money in a Western irrigation scheme.\\n\\nA term at college had been followed by a trip down East, taken for a, peculiar reason, and then, while on a visit home, the three lads had, become the possessors of an up-to-date biplane, which they named the, Dartaway. In the biplane, as related in the volume before this, called, \\\"The Rover Boys in the Air,\\\" our heroes made a somewhat spectacular, trip from the farm to the college campus, much to the amazement of, their fellow collegians and their instructors. Later they made a trip, through the air to Hope Seminary, and at that time Dick was delighted, to place upon Dora's finger a diamond engagement sing.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get the chance,\\\" returned the youngest Rover, answering the, last question first. \\\"It was on the corner below here. I was standing, in a doorway, watching up and down, when I saw a tall man come along, slowly. He halted at the corner and presently another man came out of, the side street and touched him on the arm. The second man wore a, heavy beard and a slouch hat and colored eyeglasses, but I am almost, sure it was Josiah Crabtree.\\\"\\n\\nDick had the address of the brokers in his pocket and the place was, easily found. The offices were located in an old building--one of the, oldest on the street, and also one of the shabbiest. But it was five, stories in height and boasted of two elevators, and was, from, appearances, filled with prosperous tenants. In Wall street rents are, so high that many a person doing business there is willing to take, whatever quarters he can get.\\n\\n\\\"No, I was out of town--calling on my mother, who is very old and, quite sick. There was a fire in the pantry off the kitchen, and for a, few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground. Of, course the guards got excited, and all they thought of was to put out, the blaze--and it's a good thing they did that. That's how the, prisoners got away. I suppose you've heard that we rounded up two of, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is fairly well, but he gets a bad spell ever so often, and then to, attend to business is out of the question. But that isn't the worst of, it. He has gotten tangled up in some sort of financial scheme with, some brokers in New York City and it is worrying him half to death. He, has told me something about it, but I don't know half as much as I'd, like to know.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dartaway had a powerful motor, and once on the right trail the, eldest Rover advanced his gasoline and spark, and they went rushing, through the air at express-train speed. The boys were provided with, face guards, so they did not mind this. They did not fly high, and so, kept the railroad and other familiar objects fairly well in view. They, passed over several villages, the inhabitants gazing up at them in, open-mouthed wonder, and finally came in sight of a big church spire, that they knew belonged in Plankville. Then Dick slowed down the, engine, and soon they floated down in an open field close to the main, street and not a great distance from the sheriff's office and the, jail.\\n\\nA term at school had been followed by a short cruise on the ocean, and, then a trip to the jungles of Africa, whither the lads went to find, their father, who had disappeared. Then, during vacation, the boys, took a trip West, and then another trip on the Great Lakes. After that, they went in the mountains, and then came back to Putnam Hall, to go, into camp with their fellow cadets.\\n\\n\\\"In the morning, about ten o'clock. He came down in one of the, elevators with a small package in his hand--a package, so the, elevator man said, that looked like some legal documents. He seemed to, be very much disturbed, and the man said he talked to himself. He, hurried out of the side door of the hotel, but one of the doormen saw, him go to the corner and turn down Broadway--and that was the last, seen of him, so far as we knew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We ought to get a message from New York soon,\\\" remarked Dick, after, his uncle had related the little he had to tell about how Anderson, Rover had gone away on the trip to the metropolis. Evidently Randolph, Rover knew little about the business that had taken his brother to the, city. He was no business man himself--being wrapped up in what he, called scientific farming--and probably the boys' father had not, thought it worth while to take him into his confidence.\\n\\nAs my old readers well know, Dan Baxter was an old acquaintance of the, Rover boys. When at Putnam Hall he had been a great bully, and had, tried more than once to get the best of our heroes. But he had been, foiled, and then he had drifted to the West and South, and there the, Rovers had found him, away from home and practically penniless. They, had set him on his feet, and he had gotten a position as a traveling, salesman, and now he counted the Rovers his best friends, and was, willing to do anything for them.\\n\\nIn those days Josiah Crabtree had been an instructor at Putnam Hall., He was very dictatorial, and none of the cadets liked him, and the, Rovers liked him still less when they learned that he was trying to, practically hypnotize Mrs. Stanhope into marrying him, so that he, could get control of the fortune which the widow was holding in trust, for Dora. They foiled the teacher's efforts to wed the lady, and in, the end Josiah Crabtree had to leave Putnam Hall. Later still he was, arrested for some of his misdeeds and given a short sentence in jail.\\n\\nThe Stanhope fortune, as a part of the money coming to the Stanhopes, and the Lanings was called, had come to Mr. Stanhope in a peculiar, way, and some outsiders claimed the treasure, which, at that time, was, secreted in a spot among the West Indies called Treasure Isle. There, was a lively chase to get there first, but the Rovers won out, and, because of this their enemies were more bitter than ever.\\n\\nAs I have mentioned several times, in other volumes, this line was, started with the publication of \\\"The Rover Boys at School,\\\" \\\"On the, Ocean\\\" and \\\"In the Jungle.\\\" The cordial reception afforded the stories, called for the publication of the next volume, \\\"The Rover Boys Out, West,\\\" and then, year after year, by the issuing of \\\"On the Great, Lakes,\\\" \\\"In Camp,\\\" \\\"On Land and Sea,\\\" \\\"On the River,\\\" \\\"On the Plains,\\\", \\\"In Southern Waters,\\\" \\\"On the Farm,\\\" \\\"On Treasure Isle,\\\" \\\"At College,\\\", \\\"Down East,\\\" and then by \\\"In the Air,\\\" where we last met them.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["time: 1.42 s (started: 2024-04-27 09:01:49 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["dataset.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714208511452,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"f-O4CrlogVl0","outputId":"4b33428c-501e-444b-fbd5-c5dc55c371a5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["time: 2.67 ms (started: 2024-04-27 09:01:50 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["dataset = dataset.dropna()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714208511452,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"o3G-s7atiRkd","outputId":"1744a376-86f0-413e-8056-60a9157542d7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["author_id\n","1800    160\n","1583    100\n","1181     86\n","520      70\n","213      62\n","       ... \n","808       2\n","263       2\n","832       1\n","359       1\n","292       1\n","Name: count, Length: 134, dtype: int64\n","time: 3.53 ms (started: 2024-04-27 09:01:50 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["author_counts = dataset['author_id'].value_counts()\n","print(author_counts)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714208511900,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"wWm74qBLkdIG","outputId":"d26e01c1-c23c-487e-f73a-a5df7dff755c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["time: 7.56 ms (started: 2024-04-27 09:01:50 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["dataset = dataset[~dataset['author_id'].isin([832, 359, 292])]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VBx1AoqZv0Z5"},"source":["### Preprocessing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714208511901,"user":{"displayName":"Sabína Mackovčáková","userId":"15587729232235249039"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"YbAtf4b4gyYv","outputId":"61f4a7b0-cba9-419c-80fe-b011f6c5d7c4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["time: 8.19 ms (started: 2024-04-27 09:01:50 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["def preprocess_text(text):\n","    #

We are going rather fast now.\\\"  He, extended a magnificent case of pigskin, that bloomed with fat black, cigars.  \\\"Try one of these,\\\" said the hospitable young man.  The, emotions that swept Mr. Schwab he found difficult to pursue, but he, raised his hat to the lady.  \\\"May I, Miss?\\\" he said.\\n\\nAfter behaving with perfect propriety for half an hour, just outside of, Bridgeport the Scarlet Car came to a slow and sullen stop, and once, more the owner and the chauffeur hid their shame beneath it, and, attacked its vitals.  Twenty minutes later, while they still were at, work, there approached from Bridgeport a young man in a buggy.  When he, saw the mass of college colors on the Scarlet Car, he pulled his horse, down to a walk, and as he passed raised his hat.\\n\\n\\\"I mean,\\\" said Mr. Schwab dramatically, \\\"that I've got you where I want, you, thank you.  You have killed Peabody dead as a cigar butt!  Now I, can tell them how his friends tried to bribe me.  Why do you think I, came in your car?  For what money YOU got?  Do you think you can stack, up your roll against the New York Journal's, or against Tammany's?\\\", His shrill voice rose exultantly.  \\\"Why, Tammany ought to make me judge, for this!  Now, let me down here,\\\" he commanded, \\\"and next time, don't, think you can take on 'Izzy' Schwab and get away with it.\\\"\\n\\nbecause he thought women who believed in reform should show their, interest in it in public, before all men.  Miss Forbes disagreed with, him, chiefly because whenever she sat in a box at any of the public, meetings the artists from the newspapers, instead of immortalizing the, candidate, made pictures of her and her hat.  After she had seen her, future lord and master cast his vote for reform and himself, she was to, depart by train to Tarrytown.  The Forbes's country place was there\\n\\n, For a long time it had been arranged they all should go to the Harvard, and Yale game in Winthrop's car.  It was perfectly well understood., Even Peabody, who pictured himself and Miss Forbes in the back of the, car, with her brother and Winthrop in front, condescended to approve., It was necessary to invite Peabody because it was his great good, fortune to be engaged to Miss Forbes.  Her brother Sam had been, invited, not only because he could act as chaperon for his sister, but, because since they were at St. Paul's, Winthrop and he, either as, participants or spectators, had never missed going together to the, Yale-Harvard game.  And Beatrice Forbes herself had been invited, because she was herself.\\n\\nSam came running toward them with five grizzly bears, who balanced, themselves apparently with some slight effort upon their hind legs., The grizzly bears were properly presented as:  \\\"Tommy Todd, of my, class, and some more like him.  And,\\\" continued Sam, \\\"I am going to, quit you two and go with them.  Tom's car broke down, but Fred fixed, it, and both our cars can travel together.  Sort of convoy,\\\" he, explained.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you try to teach me no law,\\\" he shouted; \\\"I know what I can do., Ef MY darter went gallivantin' around nights in one of them, automobiles, it would serve her right to get locked up.  Maybe this, young woman will learn to stay at home nights with her folks.  She, ain't goin' to take no harm here.  The constable sits up all night, downstairs in the fire engine room, and that sofa's as good a place to, sleep as the hotel.  If you want me to let her go to the hotel, why, don't you send to your folks and bail her out?\\\"\\n\\nWhen they passed through Bridgeport it was so late that the electric, lights of Fairview Avenue were just beginning to sputter and glow in, the twilight, and as they came along the shore road into New Haven, the, first car out of New Haven in the race back to New York leaped at them, with siren shrieks of warning, and dancing, dazzling eyes.  It passed, like a thing driven by the Furies; and before the Scarlet Car could, swing back into what had been an empty road, in swift pursuit of the, first came many more cars, with blinding searchlights, with a roar of, throbbing, thrashing engines, flying pebbles, and whirling wheels.  And, behind these, stretching for a twisted mile, came hundreds of others;, until the road was aflame with flashing Will-o'-the-wisps, dancing, fireballs, and long, shifting shafts of light.\\n\\nthat as she grew older and so better able to understand serious, affairs, such as the importance of having an honest man at Albany as, Lieutenant-Governor, they would become more in sympathy.  And now, at a, stroke, the whole fabric of self-deception fell from her.  It was not, that she saw Peabody so differently, but that she saw herself and her, own heart, and where it lay.  And she knew that \\\"Billy\\\" Winthrop\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense!\\\" replied Miss Forbes briskly.  \\\"You were perfectly right., If we had sent for any one, it would have had to come out.  Now, we'll, pay the fine in the morning and get home, and no one will know anything, of it excepting the family and Mr. Peabody, and they'll understand., But if I ever lay hands on my brother Sam!\\\"--she clasped her fingers, together helplessly.  \\\"To think of his leaving you to spend the night, in a cell----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They came in a car,\\\" whispered the young man.  \\\"It's broken down, and, they can't get away.  When the big fellow stopped us and I flashed my, torch, I saw their car behind him in the road with the front off and, the lights out.  He'd seen the lamps of our car, and now they want it, to escape in.  That's why he brought us here--to keep us away from our, car.\\\"\\n\\nnimbly to one side.  \\\"What do you think the Journal'll give me for that, story, hey?  'Ernest Peabody, the Reformer, Kills an Old Man, AND RUNS, AWAY.'  And hiding his face, too!  I seen him.  What do you think that, story's worth to Tammany, hey?  It's worth twenty thousand votes!\\\" The, young man danced in front of the car triumphantly, mockingly, in a, frenzy of malice.  \\\"Read the extras, that's all,\\\" he taunted.  \\\"Read, 'em in an hour from now!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Drop that gun!\\\" cried the voice.  It was no longer the same voice; it, was now savage and snarling.  For answer the young man pressed the, torch in his left hand, and, held in the two circles of light, the men, surveyed each other.  The newcomer was one of unusual bulk and height., The collar of his overcoat hid his mouth, and his derby hat was drawn, down over his forehead, but what they saw showed an intelligent, strong, face, although for the moment it wore a menacing scowl.  The young man, dropped his revolver into his pocket.\\n\\n\\\"Believe me,\\\" he assured her soothingly, \\\"I am just as good a chaperon, fifty yards behind you, and wide awake, as I am in the same car and, fast asleep.  And, besides, I want to hear about the game.  And, what's, more, two cars are much safer than one.  Suppose you two break down in, a lonely place?  We'll be right behind you to pick you up.  You will, keep Winthrop's car in sight, won't you, Tommy?\\\" he said.\\n\\nWinthrop's car, because her brother had gone to one college, and he had, played right end for the other, was draped impartially.  And so every, other car mocked or cheered it, and in one a bare-headed youth stood, up, and shouted to his fellows:  \\\"Look! there's Billy Winthrop!  Three, times three for old Billy Winthrop!\\\"  And they lashed the air with, flags, and sent his name echoing over Central Park.\\n\\nI do not recognize the right of any man to keep me quiet, or your right, either.  Why should I be held by your engagement?  I was not consulted, about it.  I did not give my consent, did I?  I tell you, you are the, only woman in the world I will ever marry, and if you think I am going, to keep silent and watch some one else carry you off without making a, fight for you, you don't know me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When I asked you how you knew my name,\\\" said the young man, \\\"I thought, you knew me as having won some races in Florida last winter.  This is, the car that won.  I thought maybe you might have heard of me when I, was captain of a football team at--a university.  If you have any idea, that you can jump from this car and not be killed, or, that I cannot, pound you into a pulp, let me prove to you you're wrong--now.  We're, quite alone.  Do you wish to get down?\\\"\\n\\nHe rebelled on the first night of his return.  As she came down to the, dinner of welcome her brother was giving Winthrop, he stared at her as, though she were a ghost, and said, so solemnly that every one in the, room, even Peabody, smiled: \\\"Now I know why I came home.\\\"  That he, refused to recognize her engagement to Peabody, that on every occasion, he told her, or by some act showed her, he loved her; that he swore she, should never marry any one but himself, and that he would never marry, any one but her, did not at first, except to annoy, in any way impress, her.\\n\\nFor many minutes, or for all Schwab knew, for many miles, the young, lady pointed out to him the places along the Hudson, of which he had, read in the public school history, and quaint old manor houses set in, glorious lawns; and told him who lived in them.  Schwab knew the names, as belonging to down-town streets, and up-town clubs.  He became, nervously humble, intensely polite, he felt he was being carried as an, honored guest into the very heart of the Four Hundred, and when the car, jogged slowly down the main street of Yonkers, although a policeman, stood idly within a yard of him, instead of shrieking to him for help\\n\\nAt the same instant from the belfry on the roof there rang out on the, night the sudden tumult of a bell; a bell that told as plainly as, though it clamored with a human tongue, that the hand that rang it was, driven with fear; fear of fire, fear of thieves, fear of a mad-man with, a knife in his hand running amuck; perhaps at that moment creeping up, the belfry stairs.\\n\\nor watchman.  He spoke as though it were natural there should be, another man in the grounds, so there's probably two of them, either to, keep Carey in, or to keep trespassers out.  Now, I think I'll go back, and tell him that Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of, water, and that all they want is to be allowed to get the water, and, go.\\\"\\n\\nand insistently, as though the information must carry some special, significance.  But the girl showed no sign of enlightenment.  \\\"You, remember the Carey boys?\\\" he urged.  \\\"They left Harvard the year I, entered.  They HAD to leave.  They were quite mad.  All the Careys have, been mad.  The boys were queer even then, and awfully rich.  Henry ran, away with a girl from a shoe factory in Brockton and lives in Paris\\n\\nAll of election day since her arrival in Winthrop's car, Miss Forbes, had kept to herself.  In the morning, when the other young people were, out of doors, she remained in her room, and after luncheon when they, gathered round the billiard table, she sent for her cart and drove off, alone.  The others thought she was concerned over the possible result, of the election, and did not want to disturb them by her anxiety., Winthrop, thinking the presence of Schwab embarrassed her, recalling as, it did Peabody's unfortunate conduct of the morning, blamed himself for, bringing Schwab to the house.  But he need not have distressed himself., Miss Forbes was thinking neither of Schwab nor Peabody, nor was she, worried or embarrassed.  On the contrary, she was completely happy.\\n\\nfrom whence he heard stifled exclamations and laughter, and some one, saying \\\"Hush.\\\"  But \\\"Izzy\\\" Schwab did not care.  The slave in brass, buttons was proffering him ivory-backed hair-brushes, and obsequiously, removing the dust from his coat collar.  Mr. Schwab explained to him, that he was not dressed for automobiling, as Mr. Winthrop had invited, him quite informally.  The man was most charmingly sympathetic.  And, when he returned to the hall every one received him with the most, genial, friendly interest.  Would he play golf, or tennis, or pool, or, walk over the farm, or just look on?  It seemed the wish of each to be, his escort.  Never had he been so popular.\\n\\n\\\"Take my coat, too,\\\" said the young man.  \\\"You'll catch cold.\\\" He spoke, with authority and began to slip the loops from the big horn buttons., It was not the habit of the girl to consider her health.  Nor did she, permit the members of her family to show solicitude concerning it.  But, the anxiety of the young man, did not seem to offend her.  She thanked, him generously.  \\\"No; these coats are hard to walk in, and I want to, walk,\\\" she exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"We have been protecting the face of nature,\\\" he shouted.  \\\"The only, way to get that gang out of the engine house was to set fire to, something.  Tommy wanted to burn up the railroad station, because he, doesn't like the New York and New Haven, and Fred was for setting fire, to Judge Allen's house, because he was rude to Beatrice.  But we, finally formed the Village Improvement Society, organized to burn all, advertising signs.  You know those that stood in the marshes, and hid, the view from the trains, so that you could not see the Sound.  We, chopped them down and put them in a pile, and poured gasolene on them\\n\\napparently, did every other inhabitant of Eighth Avenue; but Winthrop, was the first to reach him and kneeling in the car tracks, he tried to, place the head and shoulders of the body against the iron pillar.  He, had seen very few dead men; and to him, this weight in his arms, this, bundle of limp flesh and muddy clothes, and the purple-bloated face, with blood trickling down it, looked like a dead man.\\n\\nFor an instant Winthrop sat gazing gloomily ahead, overcome apparently, by the enormity of his offence.  He was calculating whether, if he, rammed the two-inch plank, it would hit the car or Miss Forbes.  He, decided swiftly it would hit his new two-hundred-dollar lamps.  As, swiftly he decided the new lamps must go.  But he had read of guardians, of the public safety so regardless of private safety as to try to, puncture runaway tires with pistol bullets.  He had no intention of, subjecting Miss Forbes to a fusillade.\\n\\nThe light showed the broad steps leading to the front entrance of the, house, and in its shaft they climbed them, pushed open the unlocked, door, and stood in a small hallway.  It led into a greater hall beyond., By the electric lights still burning they noted that the interior of, the house was as rich and well cared for as the outside was miserable., With a gesture for silence the watchman motioned them into a small room, on the right of the hallway.  It had the look of an office, and was, apparently the place in which were conducted the affairs of the estate.\\n\\n\\\"You stay here till I fetch Mr. Carey, and the servants,\\\" commanded the, watchman.  \\\"Don't try to get out, and,\\\" he added menacingly, \\\"don't, make no noise.\\\"  With his revolver he pointed at the two windows.  They, were heavily barred.  \\\"Those bars keep Mr. Carey in,\\\" he said, \\\"and I, guess they can keep you in, too.  The other watchman,\\\" he added, \\\"will, be just outside this door.\\\"  But still he hesitated, glowering with, suspicion; unwilling to trust them alone.  His face lit with an ugly, smile.\\n\\nWhen that morning she had seen Peabody running up the steps of the, Elevated, all the doubts, the troubles, questions, and misgivings that, night and day for the last three months had upset her, fell from her, shoulders like the pilgrim's heavy pack.  For months she had been, telling herself that the unrest she felt when with Peabody was due to, her not being able to appreciate the importance of those big affairs in, which he was so interested; in which he was so admirable a figure.  She, had, as she supposed, loved him, because he was earnest, masterful\\n\\ncarried an air of authority; and one, tall, stooping, weak of face and, light-haired, with eyes that blinked and trembled behind great, spectacles and who, for comfort, hugged about him a gorgeous kimono., For an instant the newcomers stared stupidly through the smoke at the, bodies on the floor breathing stertorously, at the young man with the, lust of battle still in his face, at the girl shrinking against the, wall.  It was the young man in the serge suit who was the first to move.\\n\\nagainst one of the pillars that support the overhead tracks.  Winthrop, gave a cry and fell upon the brakes.  The cry was as full of pain as, though he himself had been mangled.  Miss Forbes saw only the man, appear, and then disappear, but, Winthrop's shout of warning, and the, wrench as the brakes locked, told her what had happened.  She shut her, eyes, and for an instant covered them with her hands.  On the front, seat Peabody clutched helplessly at the cushions.  In horror his eyes, were fastened on the motionless mass jammed against the pillar., Winthrop scrambled over him, and ran to where the man lay.  So\\n\\nIn silence the girl and Winthrop followed the chauffeur.  They had, passed out of the light of the lamps, and in the autumn mist the, electric torch of the owner was as ineffective as a glow-worm.  The, mystery of the forest fell heavily upon them.  From their feet the dead, leaves sent up a clean, damp odor, and on either side and overhead the, giant pine trees whispered and rustled in the night wind.\\n\\nIn his indignation, Judge Allen rose to reply, and as, the better to, hear him, the crowd pushed forward, Fred gave way before it, until he, was left standing in sullen gloom upon its outer edge.  In imitation of, the real firemen of the great cities, the vamps of Fairport had cut a, circular hole in the floor of their clubroom, and from the engine room, below had reared a sliding pole of shining brass.  When leaving their, clubroom, it was always their pleasure to scorn the stairs and, like, real firemen, slide down this pole.  It had not escaped the notice of, Fred, and since his entrance he had been gravitating toward it.\\n\\nWhen at nine o'clock on the morning of the game, Winthrop stopped the, car in front of her door, he was in love with all the world.  In the, November air there was a sting like frost-bitten cider, in the sky, there was a brilliant, beautiful sun, in the wind was the tingling, touch of three ice-chilled rivers.  And in the big house facing Central, Park, outside of which his prancing steed of brass and scarlet chugged, and protested and trembled with impatience, was the most wonderful girl, in all the world.  It was true she was engaged to be married, and not, to him.  But she was not yet married.  And to-day it would be his, privilege to carry her through the State of New York and the State of, Connecticut, and he would snatch glimpses of her profile rising from, the rough fur collar, of her wind-blown hair, of the long, lovely, lashes under the gray veil.\\n\\nleaping, beating, dancing through her body.  It seemed as though she, could not too quickly tell Winthrop.  For both of them she had lost out, of their lives many days.  She had risked losing him for always.  Her, only thought was to make up to him and to herself the wasted time.  But, throughout the day the one-time welcome, but now intruding, friends and, the innumerable conventions of hospitality required her to smile and, show an interest, when her heart and mind were crying out the one great, fact.\\n\\nintent of purpose.  His had seemed a fine character.  When she had, compared him with the amusing boys of her own age, the easy-going, joking youths to whom the betterment of New York was of no concern, she, had been proud in her choice.  She was glad Peabody was ambitious.  She, was ambitious for him.  She was glad to have him consult her on those, questions of local government, to listen to his fierce, contemptuous, abuse of Tammany.  And yet early in their engagement she had missed, something, something she had never known, but which she felt sure, should exist.  Whether she had seen it in the lives of others, or read, of it in romances, or whether it was there because it was nature to, desire to be loved, she did not know.  But long before Winthrop, returned from his trip round the world, in her meetings with the man, she was to marry, she had begun to find that there was something, lacking.  And Winthrop had shown her that this something lacking was, the one thing needful.  When Winthrop had gone abroad he was only one, of her brother's several charming friends.  One of the amusing merry, youths who came and went in the house as freely as Sam himself.  Now\\n\\nThe car turned in between stone pillars, and under an arch of red and, golden leaves, and swept up a long avenue to a house of innumerable, roofs.  It was the grandest house Mr. Schwab had ever entered, and when, two young men in striped waistcoats and many brass buttons ran down the, stone steps and threw open the door of the car, his heart fluttered, between fear and pleasure.\\n\\nAlthough the young man glared bravely at the steel barrel and the, lifted trigger, poised a few inches from his eyes, his body, as though, weak with fright, shifted slightly and his feet made a shuffling noise, upon the floor.  When the weight of his body was balanced on the ball, of his right foot, the shuffling ceased.  Had the burglar lowered his, eyes, the manoeuvre to him would have been significant, but his eyes, were following the barrel of the revolver.\\n\\n\\\"You're very good,\\\" muttered Winthrop.  He could not understand.  This, parting from her was the great moment in his life, and although she, must know that, she seemed to be making it unnecessarily hard for him., He had told her he was going to a place very far away, to be gone a, long time, and she spoke of saying \\\"good-by\\\" to him as pleasantly as, though it was his intention to return from Uganda for breakfast.\\n\\nPeabody was a man doing a man's work.  And then she found that week, after week she became more difficult to please.  Other things in which, she wished Peabody might be more like Winthrop, obtruded themselves., Little things which she was ashamed to notice, but which rankled; and, big things, such as consideration for others, and a sense of humor, and, not talking of himself.  Since this campaign began, at times she had, felt that if Peabody said \\\"I\\\" once again, she must scream.  She assured, herself she was as yet unworthy of him, that her intelligence was weak\\n\\nthose of Neuremberg were merely reprimands.  Also he considered the, particular punishment he would mete out to Sam Forbes for his desertion, of his sister, and to Fred.  He could not understand Fred.  It was not, like the chauffeur to think only of himself.  Nevertheless, for, abandoning Miss Forbes in the hour of need, Fred must be discharged., He had, with some regret, determined upon this discipline, when from, directly over his head the voice of Fred hailed him cautiously.\\n\\nHe stepped gingerly into the front seat, and as Winthrop leaned over, him and tucked and buckled the fur robe around his knees, he could not, resist a glance at his friends on the sidewalk.  They were grinning, with wonder and envy, and as the great car shook itself, and ran easily, forward, Mr. Schwab leaned back and carelessly waved his hand.  But his, mind did not waver from the purpose of his ride.  He was not one to be, cajoled with fur rugs and glittering brass.\\n\\nFor a brief space they stood quite still, and at once, accentuated by, their own silence, the noises of the night grew in number and, distinctness.  A slight wind had risen and the boughs of the pines, rocked restlessly, making mournful complaint; and at their feet the, needles dropping in a gentle desultory shower had the sound of rain in, springtime.  From every side they were startled by noises they could, not place.  Strange movements and rustlings caused them to peer sharply, into the shadows; footsteps, that seemed to approach, and, then, having, marked them, skulk away; branches of bushes that suddenly swept, together, as though closing behind some one in stealthy retreat., Although they knew that in the deserted garden they were alone, they, felt that from the shadows they were being spied upon, that the, darkness of the place was peopled by malign presences.\\n\\n\\\"And, I believe, I've not told you,\\\" he went on, \\\"that on Wednesday I'm, running away for good, that is, for a year or two.  I've made all the, fight I can and I lose, and there is no use in my staying on here, to--well--to suffer, that is the plain English of it.  So,\\\" he, continued briskly, \\\"I won't be here for the ceremony, and this is, 'good-by' as well as 'good-night.'\\\"\\n\\nrefusing to fine him and let him go, held him and his companions for a, hearing the following morning.  He fixed the amount of bail at $500, each; failing to pay this, they would for the night be locked up in, different parts of the engine house, which, it developed, contained on, the ground floor the home of the fire engine, on the second floor the, clubroom, on alternate nights, of the firemen, the local G. A. R., and, the Knights of Pythias, and in its cellar the town jail.\\n\\nHe said he would \\\"just look on.\\\"  And so, during the last and decisive, day of the \\\"whirlwind\\\" campaign, while in Eighth Avenue voters were, being challenged, beaten, and bribed, bonfires were burning, and, \\\"extras\\\" were appearing every half hour, \\\"Izzy\\\" Schwab, the Tammany, henchman, with a secret worth twenty thousand votes, sat a prisoner, in, a wicker chair, with a drink and a cigar, guarded by four young men in, flannels, who played tennis violently at five dollars a corner.\\n\\n\\\"I asked you into this car,\\\" he shouted, \\\"because I meant to keep you, in it until I had you where you couldn't do any mischief.  I told you, I'd give you something better than the Journal would give you, and I am, going to give you a happy day in the country.  We're now on our way to, this lady's house.  You are my guest, and you can play golf, and, bridge, and the piano, and eat and drink until the polls close, and, after that you can go to the devil.  If you jump out at this speed, you, will break your neck.  And, if I have to slow up for anything, and you, try to get away, I'll go after you--it doesn't matter where it is--and, break every bone in your body.\\\"\\n\\nHe shot a look ahead, and so suddenly threw on the brake that Sam and, the chauffeur tumbled awake.  Across the road stretched the great bulk, of a touring-car, its lamps burning dully in the brilliance of the, moon.  Around it, for greater warmth, a half-dozen figures stamped upon, the frozen ground, and beat themselves with their arms.  Sam and the, chauffeur vaulted into the road, and went toward them.\\n\\n\\\"He is my doctor,\\\" he said.  \\\"He is a young man, and he has not had, many advantages--his manner is not--I find we do not get on together., I have asked them to send me some one else.\\\" He stopped suddenly, and, stood unhappily silent.  The knowledge that the strangers were, acquainted with his story seemed to rob him of his earlier confidence., He made an uncertain movement as though to relieve them of his presence.\\n\\n\\\"I am unpardonable,\\\" he said.  \\\"I live so much alone--that I forget.\\\", Like one who, issuing from a close room, encounters the morning air, he, drew a deep, happy breath.  \\\"It has been three years since a woman has, been in this house,\\\" he said simply.  \\\"And I have not even thanked, you,\\\" he went on, \\\"nor asked you if you are cold,\\\" he cried, remorsefully, \\\"or hungry.  How nice it would be if you would say you, are hungry.\\\"\\n\\nAnd to entirely remove the last trace of the gloom that Peabody had, forced upon them, it was necessary only for a tire to burst.  Of course, for this effort, the tire chose the coldest and most fiercely windswept, portion of the Pelham Road, where from the broad waters of the Sound, pneumonia and the grip raced rampant, and where to the touch a steel, wrench was not to be distinguished from a piece of ice.  But before the, wheels had ceased to complain, Winthrop and Fred were out of their fur, coats, down on their knees, and jacking up the axle.\\n\\nas they proudly informed him, members of the Fairport \\\"Volunteer Fire, Department.\\\"  That they might purchase new uniforms, they had arranged, a trap for the automobiles returning in illegal haste from New Haven., In fines they had collected $300, and it was evident that already some, of that money had been expended in bad whiskey.  As many as could do so, crowded into the car, others hung to the running boards and step\\n\\nThroughout the mishaps of the day he had been deeply concerned for her, comfort, sorry for her disappointment, under Brother Sam's indignant, ironies patient, and at all times gentle and considerate.  Now, in the, light from the onrushing cars, she noted his alert, laughing eyes, the, broad shoulders bent across the wheel, the lips smiling with excitement, and in the joy of controlling, with a turn of the wrist, a power equal, to sixty galloping horses.  She found in his face much comfort.  And in, the fact that for the moment her safety lay in his hands, a sense of, pleasure.  That this was her feeling puzzled and disturbed her, for to, Ernest Peabody it seemed, in some way, disloyal.  And yet there it was., Of a certainty, there was the secret pleasure in the thought that if, they escaped unhurt from the trap in which they found themselves, it, would be due to him.  To herself she argued that if the chauffeur were, driving, her feeling would be the same, that it was the nerve, the, skill, and the coolness, not the man, that moved her admiration.  But, in her heart she knew it would not be the same.\\n\\nIt was always a great day in the life of \\\"Izzy\\\" Schwab.  After a, luncheon, which, as he later informed his friends, could not have cost, less than \\\"two dollars a plate and drink all you like,\\\" Sam Forbes took, him on at pool.  Mr. Schwab had learned the game in the cellars of, Eighth Avenue at two and a half cents a cue, and now, even in Columbus, Circle he was a star.  So, before the sun had set, Mr. Forbes, who at, pool rather fancied himself, was seventy-five dollars poorer, and Mr., Schwab just that much to the good.  Then there followed a strange, ceremony called tea, or, if you preferred it, whiskey and soda; and the, tall footman bent before him with huge silver salvers laden down with, flickering silver lamps, and bubbling soda bottles, and cigars, and, cigarettes.\\n\\nHe buried his nose in the collar of his fur coat, and the odors of, camphor and raccoon skins instantly assailed him, but he only yawned, luxuriously and disappeared into the coat as a turtle draws into its, shell.  From the woods about him the smell of the pine needles pressed, upon him like a drug, and before the footsteps of his companions were, lost in the silence he was asleep.  But his sleep was only a review of, his waking hours.  Still on either hand rose flying dust clouds and, twirling leaves; still on either side raced gray stone walls, telegraph, poles, hills rich in autumn colors; and before him a long white road\",\n          \"He only laughed, and brushed his dark beard against the tender roses, of the little maid as he gave her up, but my stepfather, who, though, not ill-natured, often conceived the necessity of ill-nature, was, not so easily satisfied. He stood looking sternly at my white face, and my weak yielding of body at the bend of the knees, and suddenly, he caught me heavily by my bruised shoulder. \\\"What means all this\\n\\nBefore I entered the tavern, out burst Parson Downs, and caught hold, of me, with a great shout of welcome. Half-drunk he was, and yet, with a marvellous steadiness on his legs, and a command of his voice, which would have done him credit in the pulpit. It was said that, this great parson could drink more fiery liquor and not betray it, than any other man in the colony, and Nick Barry, who was something, of a wag, said that the parson's wrestlings with spirits of another, sort had rendered him powerful in his encounters with these also. Be, that as it may, though I doubt not Parson Downs had drunk more than, any man there, no sign of it was in his appearance, except that his, boisterousness was something enhanced, and his hand on my shoulder, fevered. \\\"Good day, good day, Master Harry Wingfield,\\\" he shouted., \\\"How goes the time with ye, sir? And, I say, Master Wingfield, what, will you take for thy horse there? One I have which can beat him on, any course you will pick, with all the creeks in the country to, jump, and the devil himself to have a shy at, and even will I trade, and give thee twenty pounds of tobacco to boot. 'Tis a higher horse, than thine, Harry, and can take two strides to one of his; and mine, hath four white feet, and thine but one, which, as every one knoweth, well, is not enough. What say you, Harry?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can I not bring over gowns and kerchiefs and silken ribbons for a, pretty maid without a plot? How knew you that? There is the woman's, tongue again. But can I not bring over goods even of such sort;, might I not with good reason suppose them to be for the defence of, the cause of his most gracious Majesty King Charles against the, savages, or any malcontents in his colonies? What plot, sirrah?\\\"\\n\\nThen my Lord Estes came elbowing me aside, and made no more of me, than if I were a black slave, and hoarsely shouting for the sedan, chairs and the bearers, and after him Ralph Drake and half a score, of others, and all cursing at me for a convict tutor and thrusting, at me. Then truly that temper of mine, which I have had some cause, to lament, and yet I know not if it be aught I can help, it being, seemingly as beyond the say of my own will as the recoil of a musket, or the rebound of a ball, sent me forth into the midst of that, gallant throng, and I would not say for certain, but at this late, date I am inclined to believe that I saw Ralph Drake, who came in my, way with a storm of curses, raising himself sorely from a pool of, mud, which must have worked havoc with his velvets, and my Lord, Estes struggling forth from a thorny rose bush at the gate, with, much rending of precious laces. Then I, convict though I was, yet, having, when authorised by the very conditions of my servitude, that, resolution to have my way, that a king's army could not have stopped, me, had the sedan chairs, and the bearers to the fore, and presently, we were set forth on the homeward road, I riding alongside. All the, road was white with moonlight, and when we came alongside Margery, Key's house, as I live, that white cat shot through the door, and, immediately after, I, looking back, saw the old dame herself, standing therein, though it was near morning, and she quavered forth, a blessing after me. \\\"God bless thee, Master Wingfield, in life and, death, and may the fish of the sea come to thy line, may the birds, of the air minister to thee, and all that hath breath of life\\n\\nMistress Mary gave a little gasp, and looked at me, and looked at, her sister Catherine, and well I knew it was on the tip of her, tongue to out with the whole to her grandmother. And so she would, doubtless have done had not her wonderment and suspicion that maybe, in some wise Catherine had conspired to buy for her in England the, goods of which she had cheated herself, and the terror of doing harm, to her sister and me. But never saw I a maid go so white and red and, make the strife within her so evident.\\n\\nwrought up myself into such a fever of wrath and remonstrance that, it was a wonder that my wounds did not open. I swore that submit to, such an indignity I would not, that all the authorities in the, Colony should not force me to sit in the stocks, that I would have, my life first, and I looked about wildly for my own sword or, pistols, and seeing them not, besought the parson for his. He strove, in vain to comfort me. I was weakened by my wounds, and there was, I, suppose, something of fever still lingering in my veins for all the, bleeding, and for a space I was like a madman at the thought of the, ignominy to which they would put me. I besought that the, lieutenant-governor should be summoned and be petitioned to make my, offence a capital one. I strove to rise from my couch, and the vague, thought of finding a weapon and committing some crime so grave that, the stocks would be out of the question as a punishment for it, was, in my fevered brain.\\n\\nA woman, by reason of her great tenderness of heart which makes her, suffer overmuch for those she loves, has not the strength to bear, the pain of loving more than one or two so entirely, and my mother's, whole heart was fixed with an anxious strain of loving care upon my, stepfather and my brother. I have seen her sit hours by a window as, pale as a statue while my stepfather was away, for those were, troublous times in England, and he in the thick of it. When I was a, lad of six or thereabouts they were bringing the king back to his, own, and some of the loyal ones were in danger of losing their heads, along his proposed line of march. And I have known her to hang whole, nights over my brother's bed if he had but a tickling in the throat;, and what could one poor woman do more?\\n\\n\\\"I have the honour to salute you, Mistress,\\\" he spoke with a grace, somewhat beyond his calling. He was a young man, as fair as a, Dutchman and a giant in stature. He bore himself also curiously for, one of his calling, bowing as steadily as a cavalier, with no, trembling of the knees when he recovered, and carrying his right arm, as if it would grasp sword rather than cutlass if the need arose.\\n\\nI laughed and shook my head, and went away to my own quarters and, sat down to my books, but, at something past midnight, Madam, Cavendish sent for me in all haste. She had gone to bed, and I was, ushered to her bedroom, and when I saw her thin length of age scarce, rounding the coverlids, and her face frilled with white lace, and, her lean neck stretching up from her pillows with the piteous, outreaching of a bird, a great tenderness of compassion for, womanhood, both in youth and beauty and age and need, beyond which I, can express, came over me. It surely seems to me the part of man to, deal gently with them at all times, even when we suffer through, them, for there is about them a mystery of helplessness and, misunderstanding of themselves which should give us an exceeding, patience. And it seems to me that, even in the cases of those women, who are perhaps of greater wit and force of character than many a, man, not one of them but hath her helplessness of sex in her heart\\n\\n, The sports and races of Royal Oak Day were to be held on the \\\"New, Field\\\" (so called), adjoining the plantation of Barry Upper Branch., The stocks had been moved from their usual station to this place to, remind the people in the midst of their gayety that the displeasure, of the King was a thing to be dreaded, and that they were not their, own masters, even when they made merry.\\n\\nI got my fowling-piece from the peg on the wall, and was forth and, ranging the wooded shores, with my eyes intent on the whirring, flight of the birds, and my mind on that problem of the times which, always hath, and doth, and always will, encounter a man who lives, with any understanding of what is about him, but not always as, sorely as in my case, who faced, as it were, an army of, difficulties, bound hand and foot. But after a while the sport in, which I was fairly skilled, and that sense of power which cometh to, one from the proving of his superiority over the life and death of, some weaker creation, and the salt air in my nostrils, gave me, as, it were, a glimpse of a farther horizon than the present one of, Virginia in 1682, and mine own little place in it. Then verily I, could seem to see and scent like some keen hound a smoothness which, should later come from the tangled web of circumstances, and a, greatness which should encompass mine own smallness of perplexity.\\n\\nhave swayed an army, so full of utter good-will and lovingkindness, it was, and, more than that, of such confidence in theirs in return, that it would have taken not only knaves, but knaves with no conceit, of themselves, to have forsworn her good opinion of them. Suddenly, there rose a great shout and such a volley of cheering and hallooing, as can come only from English throats. A tall lad cast a great, wreath over Mistress Mary's own head, and cried out with a shout, that here, here was Maid Marion. And scores of voices echoed his, with \\\"Maid Marion, Marion!\\\" And then, to my great astonishment and, dismay, for a man is with no enemy so much at a loss as with a, laughing one, since it wrongs his own bravery to meet smiles with, blows, they gave forth that I was Robin Hood; that the convict, tutor, Harry Wingfield, was Robin Hood!\\n\\nWhen I came to myself I was lying bound with a soldier standing, guard over me, though there was small need of it, and they were, raining battering blows upon the door of Laurel Creek. Somehow they, had conceived the idea that there was something of great import, therein, by my mad and desperate defence. I know not what they, thought, but gradually all the militia were centred at that point, striving to force the door. As for the shutters, they were heavily, barred, and offered no easier entrance. Indeed the whole house had, been strengthened for defence against the Indians before the Bacon, uprising, and was near as strong as a fort. It would have been well, had we all entered and defended it, though we could not have held, out for long, through not being provisioned.\\n\\nbut they might as well for a time have tried to drag a bar of steel, from its fastenings. I thrust out here and there, and I trow my, steel drew blood, and I suppose my own flowed, for presently I was, kneeling in a widening circle of red. I cut those forcing hands from, my arm, and others came. It was one against a multitude, for the, rabble after hitting wild blows as often at their friends as at, their enemies had broken and fled, except those who were taken, prisoners. But the women stayed until the last and fought like wild, cats, with the exception of Madam Tabitha Story, who quietly got, upon her old horse, and ambled away, and cut down her own tobacco, until daybreak, pressing her slaves into service.\\n\\n\\\"Who goes there?\\\" I called out softly, but I knew well enough. 'Tis, sometimes a stain on a man's manhood, the hatred he can bear to a, woman who is continually between him and his will, and his keen, apprehension of her as a sort of a cat under cover beside his path., So I knew well enough it was Catherine Cavendish, and indeed I, marvelled that I had gotten thus far without meeting her. She, stepped forward with no more ado when I accosted her, and spoke, but, with great caution.\\n\\nwith her ready wit and supply of money through her inheritance from, her mother, might have concocted the scheme of bringing over, ammunition from England to enable us to make a stand against the, government; but the plot in the first of it could not have been hers, alone. Assuredly Ralph Drake was concerned in it, and Sir Humphrey, Hyde, and no one knew how many more. The main part for Mistress Mary, might well have been the furnishing of the powder and shot, for, Ralph Drake was poor, and lived, it was said, by his good luck at, cards; and as for Sir Humphrey Hyde, his mother held the reins in, those soft hands of hers, which would have been sorely bruised had, they been withdrawn too roughly.\\n\\nwas with an eye toward the other's approbation, especially after the, advent of her grandmother. Catherine had lovers, but she would have, none of them. It seemed as if the maternal love of which most maids, feel the unknown and unspelled yearning, and which, perchance, may, draw them all unwittingly to wedlock, had seized upon Catherine, Cavendish, and she had, as it were, fulfilled it by proxy by this, love of her young sister, and so had her heart made cold toward all, lovers. Be that as it may, though she was much sought after by more, than one of high degree, she remained as she was.\\n\\nthat the leaves lay in a green pumice, and that crop lost. And then, this Navigation Act, which I understand but little of except that it, be to fill the king's pockets and empty ours, has made our crops of, no avail, since we but sent the tobacco as a gift to the king, so, little we have got in return. And look, look!\\\" she shrieked, \\\"I pray, ye look, and sure this is the best I have, and me always going as, well attired as any of my station in England. I pray ye look! Sure, 'tis past mending, and the stitches and the cloth go together, as, will the colony, unless somewhat be done in season to mend its, state.\\\" So saying, up she flung her arm, and all the under side of, the body of her gown was in rags, and up she flung the other, and, that was in like case.\\n\\nThe grounds of Laurel Creek and the tobacco fields were a most, lamentable sight, though I seemed to see everything as through a, mist. Here and there one lay sprawled with limbs curled like a dead, spider, or else flung out at a stiff length of agony. And Capt. Noel, Jaynes lay dead with a better look on his gaunt old face in death, than in life. In truth Capt. Noel Jaynes might almost have been, taken for a good man as he lay there dead. And the outlaw who lived, next door to Margery Key was doubled up where he fell in a sulky, heap of death, and by his side wept his shrewish wife, shrilly, lamenting as if she were scolding rather than grieving, and I trow, in the midst of it all, the thought passed through my mind that it, was well for that man that he was past hearing, for it seemed as if, she took him to task for having died.\\n\\nthough it might have been otherwise had the state of the country, been different. I can imagine that I might in some severe stress, have had my mind, being a hot-headed youth, diverted by the feel of, the sword-hilt. But just then the king sat on his throne, and there, was naught to disturb the public peace except his multiplicity of, loves, which aroused discussion, which salted society with keenest, relish, but went no farther.\\n\\nhowever concealed by her majesty of carriage. So, when I saw Madam, Cavendish, old and ill at ease in her mind because of me, and, realised all at once how it was with her in spite of that clear head, of hers and imperious way which had swayed to her will all about her, for near eighty years, I went up to her, and, laying a gentle hand, upon her head, laid it back upon the pillow, and touched her poor, forehead, wrinkled with the cares and troubles of so many years, and, felt all the pity in me uppermost. \\\"'Tis near midnight, and you have, not slept, madam,\\\" I said. \\\"I pray you not to fret any longer about, that which we can none of us mend, and which is but to be borne as, the will of the Lord.\\\"\\n\\nand she is so clever as never was, and all I have to win her notice, be in my hands and heels, for, Harry, you will remember the race, I ran with Tom Talbot that Mayday; think you she knows of that?, And--but she must know how I rode against Nick Barry last St., Andrew's, and, and--oh, Lord, Harry, what am I that she should think, of me? But at all odds, whether it be me or you or any other man\\n\\nWith that she bade my brother John get some cool water from the, jailer, and she bathed my head and arranged my bandages with that, same skill which she had showed at the time when I was bruised by, the mad horse, and my brother looked on as if only half pleased, yet, full of pity. And Catherine, as she bathed my head, told me how, Major Beverly and Sir Humphrey were yet confined on shipboard, and, Dick Barry was in the prison not far from me, and Nick and Ralph, Drake were in hiding, but my Lord Estes was scot-free on account of, his relationship to Governor Culpeper and had been to Drake Hill\\n\\n, Although I was heir to a large estate, I had not much gold and, silver nor many treasures in my possession. I never knew rightly, why; but my mother, having control until I was come of age, and, having, indeed, the whole property at her disposal, doubtless, considered it best that the wealth should accumulate rather than be, frittered away in trifles which could be of but passing moment to a, boy. But I was well equipped enough as regarded comforts, and, as I, said before, my education was well looked after. Through never, having much regard for such small matters, it used to gall me not at, all that my half-brother, who was younger and such a fair lad that, he became them like a girl, should go clad in silks and velvets and, laces, with a ready jingle of money in his purse and plenty of, sweets and trinkets to command. But after I saw that little maid it, went somewhat hard with me that I had no bravery of apparel to catch, her sweet eyes and cause her to laugh and point with delight, as I, have often seen her do, at the glitter of a loop of gold or a, jewelled button or a flash of crimson sheen from a fold of velvet\\n\\nthough marvelling, not afraid, for things that I understand not, and, that seem to savour of something outside the flesh, have always, rather aroused me to rage as of one who was approached by other than, the given rules of warfare rather than fear. I have always argued, that an apparition should attack only his own kind, and hath no, right to leave his own battlefield for ours, when we be at a, disadvantage by our lack of understanding as to weapons. So if I had, time I would have ridden after that corpse candle and gotten, if I, could, a sight of the bearer had he been fiend or spook, but I knew, that I had none to lose. So I rode on hard to Barry Upper Branch.\\n\\nWe gentlemen kept together in some wise, and gradually gained on, Mary, who had had the start, and there were some seven of us, one of, the Barrys, Sir Humphrey Hyde, Ralph Drake, Parson Downs, in such, guise for a parson that no one would have known him, booted and, spurred, and riding harder than any by virtue of his best horse in, the Colony, myself, and two of the burgesses. We seven gaining on, the rabble, in spite of the fact that many of them were mounted upon, Major Robert Beverly's best horses, through their having less, knowledge of horsemanship, closed around Mary Cavendish on Merry, Roger, clearing the ground with long galloping bounds, and Catherine, with the strange horseman was somewhat behind.\\n\\nexposed to the jibes of a common crowd, was another. And more than, aught else, I felt the sting of the comedy in it. To sit there with, my two feet straight out, soles to the people, through those rude, holes in the boards, and all at liberty to gaze and laugh at me, was, infinitely worse than to welter in my blood upon the scaffold. How, many times, as I sat there, it came to me that if it had been the, scaffold, Mary Cavendish could at least have held my memory in some, respect; as it was, she could but laugh. Full easy it may be for any, man with the courage of a man to figure in tragedy, but try him in, comedy, if you would prove his mettle.\\n\\nI rode a pace behind Mary Cavendish, and never glanced her way, not, needing to do so in order to see her, for I seemed to see her with a, superior sort of vision compounded partly of memory and partly of, imagination. Of the latter I had, not to boast, though it may, perchance be naught to boast of, being simply a kind of higher, folly, a somewhat large allowance from my childhood. But that was, not to be wondered at, whether it were to my credit or otherwise\\n\\nIt was well toward morning, and indeed a faint pallor of dawn was in, the east, and now and then a bird was waking. Not a slave on the, plantation was astir, and the sounds of slumber were coming from the, quarters. So I myself put my borrowed horse in stable, and then was, seeking my own room, when, passing through the hall, a white figure, started forth from a shadow and caught me by the arm, and it was, Catherine Cavendish. She urged me forth to the porch, I being, bewildered and knowing not how, nor indeed if it were wise, to, resist her. But when we stood together there, in that hush of, slumber only broken now and then by the waking love of a bird, and, it seemed verily as if we two were alone in the whole world, a sense, of the situation flashed upon me. I turned on my heel to reenter the, house. \\\"Madam,\\\" I said, \\\"this will never do. If you remain here with, me, your reputation--\\\"\\n\\nwhen I was set therein, had great privacy, though I knew by the, sounds that I was attended by the motley crowd which usually is in, following at such affairs, beside the little troop of horse which, was my escort, and my brother and Parson Downs riding on either, side. Parson Downs, though some might reckon him as being somewhat, contumelious in his manner of leaving the tobacco-cutting, yet was, not so when there was anything to be gained by his service. He was, moreover quit of any blame by his office of spiritual adviser\\n\\nand I loved his love for Mary Cavendish, and I could think of no one, to whom I would so readily trust her, and it seemed to me that, perchance I might, by some praising of him, and swerving her, thoughts to his track, lead her to think favourably of his suit. But, a man makes many a mistake as to women, and one of the most frequent, is that the hearts of them are like wax, to be moulded into this and, that shape. That morning, when I met Mistress Mary at the breakfast, table, she was pale and distraught, and not only did not speak to me, nor look at me, but when I ventured to speak in praise of Sir, Humphrey's gallant looks at the ball, she turned upon me so fiercely, with encomiums of my Lord Estes, whom I knew to be not worthy of, her, that I held my tongue. But when Sir Humphrey came riding up a, little later, she greeted him with such warmth as at once put me to, torture, and aroused that spirit of defence of her against myself, which hath been the noblest thing in my poor life.\\n\\naccording to my mind, both wise and discreet, though probably, somewhat inflamed by his own circumstances. The greatest store of, tobacco of any one in the colony had Major Robert Beverly, and a, fair young wife who loved that which the proceeds could buy. And as, he spoke there was a great uproar outside, and the tramp of horses, and jingle of swords and spurs, and a whole troop of horse came, riding into the grounds of Barry Upper Branch. And some of those in, the hall turned pale and looked about for an exit, and some grasped, their swords, and some laughed knowingly, and Major Beverly strode, to the door, and behind him Parson Downs, and Capt. Noel Jaynes, and, the Barry brothers, and some others, and I, pressing close, and, there was a half-whispered conference between Major Beverly and the, leader of the horse. Then Major Beverly turned to us. \\\"Gentlemen,\\\", he said, \\\"I am assured that in case of a rising we have naught to, fear from the militia, who are in like case with the other sufferers, from the proceedings of the government, being about to be disbanded, in arrears of their pay. Gentlemen, I am assured by Capt. Thomas, Marvyn that his men are with us in heart and purpose, and though, they may not help, unless the worse come to the worse, they will, not hinder.\\\"\\n\\nif it was my blam, let them which made me come to acount fo'rt. I, send herewith my great emruld ringg, with dimends which I suspect, hath been the means of sending an inosent man into slavery. I had a, mind some years agone to wed with Caterin Cavendish, and she bein a, hard made to approche, having ever a stiff turn of the sholder, toward me, though I knew not why, I was not willin to resk my sute, by word of mouth, nor having never a gift in writin by letter. And, so, knowin that mades like well such things, I bethought me of my, emruld ring, and on the night of the ball, I being upstair in to lay, off my hatt and cloak, stole privily into Catherin's chamber, she, being a-dancin below, and I laid the ring on her dresing table\\n\\nfor all thirst is not for the noblest ends, crawled through a gap in, the snowy May hedge, and was slinking across the park of Cavendish, Hall with long, loose-jointed lopes like a stray puppy, and maybe, with some sense of being where I should not, though I could not have, rightly told why, since there were no warnings up against, trespassers, and I had no designs upon any hare nor deer.\\n\\nThen the parson, who had a poetical turn, especially when in his, cups, added, quite gravely, that no safer place could there be for, powder than the tomb of love whose last sparks had died out in, ashes; and Dick Barry cried with an oath that it would serve Robert, Beverly rightly for his action against them in the Bacon rising, for, though he was to the front with the oppressed people in this, his, past foul treachery against them was not forgot, and well he, remembered that when he was in hiding for his life--\\n\\nand the mob shrieking in a frenzy of delight, and now and then a, woman in terror before the onslaught of a galloping horse, and now, and then a whole group of cutters overset by a charging hog, and up, and after him, and slaying him, and his squeals of agony, verily I, had preferred a battlefield of a different sort. And all this time, Major Robert Beverly's house stood still in the moonlight, and not a, noise from the slave quarters, and the fields were all in a pumice, of wasted plant life, and we were about to go farther when I heard, again the cry of the little child coming from a chamber window. I, trow they had given her some quieting potion or she had broken, silence before.\\n\\nThen I saw a great running hither and thither, and presently a boat, touched water from the side of the Golden Horn with a curious, lapping dip, and I was off my horse and tied him fast to a tree on, the bank, with loose rein that he might crop his fill of the sweet, spring herbage, and when the boat touched bank was in her and, speedily aboard the ship.\\n\\nmoreover, of an age to look at a girl and look away again to my own, affairs, I had thought no more of her, but I knew her at once. She, was, as I said before, not a beauty at that time, being one of those, maids which, like some flowers, are slow of bloom. She had grown so, fast and far that she had outspeeded her grace. She was full of, triangles instead of curves; her shyness was so intense that it, became aggressiveness. The greenness and sallowness of immaturity, that come before the perfection of bloom were on her face, and her, eyes either shrank before one or else gleamed fiercely with the, impulse of concealment. There is in all youth and imperfection a, stage wherein it turns at bay to protect its helplessness with a, vain show of inadequate claws and teeth, and Catherine Cavendish had, reached it, and I also, in my different estate as a boy.\\n\\nI used to slink away as soon as possible when my mother turned her, startled blue eyes upon me in such wise, that she might regain her, peace, and sometimes I used to send my brother John to her on some, errand, if I could manage it, knowing that he could soon drive me, from her mind. One learns early such little tricks with women; they, are such tender things, and it stirs one's heart to impatience to, see them troubled. However, I will not deny that I may have been at, times disturbed with some bitterness and jealousy at the sight of my, brother and my stepfather having that which I naturally craved, for, the heart of a little lad is a hungry thing for love, and has pangs, of nature which will not be stilled, though they are to be borne, like all else of pain on earth. But after I saw Mary Cavendish, all that passed, for I got, through loving so entirely, such, knowledge of love in others that I saw that the excuse of love\\n\\nThat morning Mistress Mary glowed and glittered and flamed in, gorgeous apparel, until she seemed to fairly overreach all the, innocent young flowery beauties of the spring with one rich trill of, colour, like a high note of a bird above a wide chorus of others., Mistress Mary that morning wore a tabby petticoat of a crimson, colour, and a crimson satin bodice shining over her arms and, shoulders like the plumage of a bird, and down her back streamed her, curls, shining like gold under her gauze love-hood. I knew well how, she had sat up late the night before fashioning that hood from one, which her friend Cicely Hyde's grandmother had sent her from, England, and I knew, the first pages of a young maid being easy to, spell out, that she wondered if I, though only her tutor, approved, her in it, but I gave no sign. The love-hood was made of such thin, and precious stuff that the gold of her head showed through.\\n\\nThen passed us, booted and spurred, for he had gotten his priestly, robes off in a hurry, Parson Downs on the fastest horse in those, parts, and riding like a jockey in spite of his heavy weight. His, horse's head was stretched in a line with his neck, and after him, rode, at near as great speed, Capt. Noel Jaynes, who, as report had, it, had won wealth on the high seas in unlawful fashion. He was a, gray old man, with the eye of a hot-headed boy, and a sabre-cut, across his right cheek.\\n\\n\\\"Nick and Dick swear they will not run the risk; that they have but, too lately escaped with their lives, and are too close watched, and, as for the parson, 'tis out of the question, and Ralph Drake hath no, hiding-place, and as for the others, they one and all refuse, and, say this is the safest place in the colony, it being a household of, women, and Madam Cavendish well known for her loyalty.\\\"\\n\\nIt had been a hard task for many planters to purchase the, necessaries of life with the profits of their tobacco crop, since, the trade with the Netherlands was prohibited by His Most Gracious, Majesty, King Charles II, for the supply being limited to the, English market, had so exceeded the demand that it brought but a, beggarly price per pound. Therefore, I wondered, knowing that many, of those articles of women's attire mentioned by Mistress Mary were, of great value, and brought great sums in London, and knowing, too\\n\\nand would be as uncontrollable were it not that a man is mightier, even than that to which he owes his own existence, and hath the, power of putting that which he loves before his own desire of it., But for the time, knowing well that I could at any time take up the, reins to the bridling of myself, I let them hang loose, and over and, over I whispered what Mary Cavendish had said, and over and over I, felt that touch of delicate tenderness on my arm, and I built up, such great castles that they touched the farthest skies of my fancy\\n\\ntake it up and look at it with exceeding astonishment, and then lay, it down not on the spot whereon I had left it, but on the, prayer-book on the little stand beside her bed, and then go down, stairs, frowning. Then this same Charlotte, having litle interest in, life as to her own affairs, and forced to suck others, if she would, keep her wits nourished, being watchful, saw me enter, and miss the, ring, and heard the hue and cry which I raised. And then she, still, watching, saw Master Harry Wingfield, who with others was searching, the house for the lost treasure, stop as he was passing the open, door of Caterin's chamber, because the green light of the emruld, fixed his eyes, and rush in and secrete the ring upon his person., This Charlotte saw, and told Madam Cavendish, who bound her over to, secresy to save the honour of the family, believing that her own, granddaughter Caterin was the thief. This epistle, cousin, is to, prove to you that Caterin was no thief, but simply a cold maid, who, hath no love for either hearts or gems, but of that I complain not\\n\\nhave done,\\\" I said, and she looked at me, and there came a strange, expression, which I had never seen before, into her blue eyes, half, of yielding as to some strength which she feared, and half of that, high enthusiasm of youth and noble sentiment which threatened to, swamp her in its mighty flow as it had done her hero Bacon before, her. I know not if I could have held her; it all passed in a second, the while those wild huzzas continued, and the crowd pressed closer\\n\\nwhen I saw Mary Cavendish dressed for the governor's ball, that she, was the crown of all. I verily believe that never since the world, was made, not even that beautiful first woman who comprehended in, herself all those witcheries of her sex which have been ever since, to our rapture and undoing, not even Eve when Adam first saw her in, Paradise, nor Helen, nor Cleopatra, nor any of those women whose, faces have made powers of them and given them niches in history\\n\\nI know not how proudly and bitterly I said that last, but Major, Beverly looked at me, and a kindly look came into his eyes. \\\"Master, Wingfield,\\\" he said, \\\"the word of any English gentleman is, sufficient,\\\" and I could have blessed him for it, and have ever, since had remorse for my taking advantage of his dark closet of an, old love for the hiding of the secret of the ammunition.\\n\\nPresently up stood Mary and Cicely, and Cicely flashed in the sun a, little silver mirror which she had brought and which had lain, glittering in the grass a little removed, and looked at herself, and, saw that her brown cheeks were as ever, with the exception of the, flush caused by rubbing, and tossed it with her undaunted laugh to, Mary. \\\"The more fool be I!\\\" she cried out, \\\"instead of washing mine, own face in the May dew, better had it been had I locked thee in the, clothes-press, Mary Cavendish, and not let thee add to thy beauty\\n\\nEarly that morning the news spread that Colonel Kemp of the, Gloucester militia and a troop of horse and foot had been sent, secretly against some plant-cutters in Gloucester County who had, arisen before us, and had taken prisoners some twenty-two caught in, the act. The news of the sending came first, I think, from Major, Robert Beverly, the Clerk of the Assembly, who had withheld the, knowledge for some time, inasmuch as he disliked the savour of, treachery, but being in his cups that night before at Barry Upper, Branch, out it came. 'Twas Dick Barry who told me. I fell in with, him and Captain Jaynes on the Jamestown road that morning. \\\"Colonel, Kemp hath ridden against the rioters in Gloucester with foot and, horse, by order of the general court, and Beverly hath been knowing, to it all this time,\\\" he said gloomily. Then added that a man who, served on two sides had no strength for either, and one who had, raised his hand against Bacon had best been out of the present, cause. But Captain Jaynes swore with one of his broadsides of mighty, oaths that 'twas best as 'twas, since Beverly had some influence, over the militia, and that he was safe enough not to turn traitor, with his great store of tobacco at stake, and that should the court, proceed to extremes with the Gloucester plant-cutters, such a flame, would leap to life in Virginia as would choke England with the smoke, of its burning.\\n\\n\\\"That I cannot answer you, madam,\\\" said I, and bowed and would have, passed, but she stood before me. So satin smooth was her hair that, even the fresh wind could not ruffle it, and in such straight, lines of maiden modesty hung her green gown--always she wore, green, and it became her well, and 'twas a colour I always, fancied--that it but fluttered a little around her feet in the, marsh grass, but her face looked out from a green gauze hood with an, expression that belied all this steadfastness of primness and, decorum. It was as if a play-actress had changed her character and, not her attire, which suited another part. Out came her slim arm, as, if she would have caught me by the hand for the sake of compelling, my answer; then she drew it back and spoke with all the sharp, vehemence of passion of a woman who oversteps the bounds of, restraint which she has set herself, and is a wilder thing than if, she had been hitherto unfettered by her will.\\n\\nHarry, was there ever one like that girl? All the spirit of daring, of a man she has, and yet is she full of all the sweet ways of a, maid. Faith, she would draw sword one minute and tie a ribbon the, next. She would have followed Bacon to the death, and sat up all, night to broider herself a kerchief. Comrade and sweetheart both she, is, and was there ever one like her for beauty? Harry, Harry, saw, you ever such a beauty as Mary Cavendish?\\\"\\n\\nIt was thus the next morning, the morning of the day of my Lord, Culpeper's ball. It was a warm morning, and the doors and windows of, the hall were set wide open, and all the spring wind and scent, coming in and dimity curtains flying like flags, and the gold of, Mistress Mary's hair tossing now and then in a stronger gust, and, she and Catherine cramming down their flax baskets, lest the flax, take wings to itself and fly away. Both Mary and Catherine were at, their flax-wheels, but Madam Cavendish was in the loom-room with, some of the black women. Mary had her Latin book open, as I have, said before, on a chair at her side, but Catherine span with her, fair face set to some steady course of thought, though she too was, fond of books. Never a lesson had she taken of me, holding me in, such scorn, but I questioned much at the time, and know now, that, she was well acquainted with whatever knowledge her sister had got\\n\\nI was glad enough when the drums challenged again for a race of, boys, who were to run one hundred and twelve yards for a hat., Everybody turned from me to see that, and I watched wearily the, straining backs and elbows of the little fellows, and the shouts of, encouragement and of triumph when the winner came in smote my ears, as through water, with curious shocks of sound.\\n\\nOn the morning of that day came my brother John's man-servant to, shave and dress me, and the physician to attend to my wounds. It was, a marvel that I was able to undergo the ordeal, and indeed, my, brother had striven hard to urge my wounds as a reason for my being, released. But such a naturally strong constitution had I, or else so, faithfully had the physician tended me, with such copious lettings, of blood and purges, that except for an exceeding weakness, I was, quite myself. Still I wondered, after I had been shaven and put into, my clothes, which hung somewhat loosely upon me, as I sat on a bench, by the window, however I was to reach the New Field.\\n\\nMartyn Jennings, and he was over me looking to my wounds, and, letting a little more blood to decrease my fever, though I had, already lost so much, and then, since I was so near swooning, giving, me a glass of the Burgundy on the stand. And whilst that was, clouding my brain, since my stomach was fasting, and I had lost so, much blood, entered that woman whom I had espied, and she was not, Mary, but Catherine Cavendish, and there was a gentleman with her, who stood aloof, with his back toward me, gazing out of the window\\n\\nBut she flung away from me at that with a sudden movement of, amazement and indignation and hurt, which cut me to the quick., \\\"Yes,\\\" she said, \\\"yes, Master Wingfield, truly I believe that Sir, Humphrey Hyde would do me any service that came in his way, and, truly he is a brave lad. I have a great esteem for Humphrey--I, have a greater esteem for Humphrey than for all the rest--and I, care not if you know it, Master Wingfield.\\\"\\n\\nBut Catherine Cavendish needed but a moment for that problem., \\\"'Twill return,\\\" said she. \\\"Captain Tabor hath but sailed off a, little distance that he may return and make port, as if for the, first time since he left England, and so put them off the scent of, the Sabbath unlading of those other wares.\\\" She looked down the, burnished flow of the river as she spoke, and cried out that she, could see a sail, but I, looking also, could not see anything save, the shimmer of white and green spring boughs into which the river, distance closed.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Captain Tabor, \\\"then must you and Mistress Catherine, Cavendish show the goods to the maid, and say naught as to the means, by which you came by them; tell her they are landed from the Golden, Horn, as indeed they will be; let her think aught she chooses, that, they are indeed her own, purchased for her by her sister or her, lovers, if she choose to think so, and bid her display them with no, ado to Madam Cavendish, if she value the safety of the others who, are concerned in this. Betwixt the mystery and the fright and the, sight of the trinkets, if she be aught on the pattern of any other, maid, show them she will, and hold her tongue till she be out of her, grandmother's presence.\\\"\\n\\nwere as beautiful as Mary Cavendish that night. And I doubt if it, were because she was beheld by the eyes of a lover. I verily believe, that I saw aright, and gave her beauty no glamour because of my, fondness for her, for not one whit more did I love her in that, splendour than in her plainest gown. But, oh, when she stood before, her grandmother and me and a concourse of slaves all in a ferment of, awe and admiration, with flashings of white teeth and upheavals of, eyes and flingings aloft of hands in half-savage gesticulation, and, courtesied and turned herself about in innocent delight at her own, loveliness, and yet with the sweetest modesty and apology that she, was knowing to it! That stuff which had been sent to my Lady, Culpeper and which had been intercepted ere it reached her was of a, most rich and wonderful kind. The blue of it was like the sky, and, through it ran the gleam of silver in a flower pattern, and a great, string of pearls gleamed on her bosom, and never was anything like, that mixture of triumph in, and abashedness before, her own, exceeding beauty and her perception of it in our eyes in her dear, and lovely face. She looked at us and actually shrank a little, as, if our admiration were something of an affront to her maiden, modesty, and blushed, and then she laughed to cover it, and swept a, courtesy in her circling shimmer of blue, and tossed her head and, flirted a little fan, which looked like the wing of a butterfly\\n\\nThen again, the horses, after the challenge of the drums, sped, around the three-mile course, and attention was diverted somewhat, from me. There had been mischievous boys enough for my torment, had, it not been for my brother John, who stood beside the stocks, his, face white and his hand at his sword. Many a grinning urchin drew, near with a stone in hand and looked at him, and looked again, then, slunk away, and made as if he had no intention of throwing aught, at me. After the horse-racing came music of drums, trumpets, and, hautboys, and then in spite of my brother, the crowd pressed close, about me, and many scurrilous things were said and many grinning, faces thrust in mine, and thinking of it now, I would that I had, them all in open battlefield, for how can a man fight ridicule?, Verily it is like duelling with a man of feathers. Quite still I, sat, but felt that dignity and severity of bearing but made me more, vulnerable to ridicule. Utterly weaponless I was against such odds.\\n\\nbut sunk in a languorous calm like a great cat, with Nick Barry, now, his song was done, lolling against her, and two white women, one, young and well favoured, and the other harshly handsome, both with, their husbands present, and I doubt not decent women enough, though, something violent of temper. As I entered, Mistress Allgood, one of, them, begun a harangue at the top of a shrill voice, with her, husband plucking vainly at her sleeve to temper her vehemence., Mistress Allgood was long and lean, and gaunt, with red fires in the, hollows of her cheeks and a compelling flash of black eyes under, straight frowning brows. \\\"Gentlemen,\\\" said she--\\\"be quiet, John, Allgood, my speech I will have, since thou being a man hath not the, tongue of one. I pray ye, gentlemen listen to my cause of complaint., Here my goodman and me did come to this oppressed colony of, Virginia, seven years since, having together laid by fifty pound, from the earnings of an inn called the Jolly Yeoman in Norfolkshire\\n\\nfor her baby fancy, be as good as my brother's gold and silver, and, shells, and red and russet moss. All these I offered her from time, to time as reverently and shyly as any true lover; though she was, but a baby tugging with a sweet angle of opposition at her black, nurse's hand and I near a man grown, and though I had naught to hope, for save a fleeting grasp of her rosy fingers and a wavering smile, from her sweet lips and eyes, ere she flung the offering away with, innocent inconstancy.\\n\\nand are invincible. But it may be that the noble wave of rebellion, which he raised is even now going on, never to quite cease in all, time, for I know not the laws that govern such things. It may be, that, in consequence of that great and brief struggle of Nathaniel, Bacon, this New World will never sit quietly for long at the foot, of any throne, but that I know not, being no prophet. However, this, I do know, that his influence was not then ceased in Virginia\\n\\nwith patches of grass gleaming like emeralds in the wetness of, sunken places and unexpected pools of marsh water gleaming out of, the distances like sapphires. The blossoms thrust out toward us from, every hand like insistent arms of beauty. There was a frequent bush, by the wayside full of a most beautiful pink-horned flower, so, exceeding sweet that it harmed the worth of its own sweetness, and, its cups seemed fairly dripping with honey and were gummed together, with it. There were patches of a flower of a most brilliant and, wonderful blue colour, and spreads as of cloth of gold from cowslips, over the lowlands. The road was miry in places, and then I would, fall behind her farther still that the water and red mud splashing, from beneath my horse's hoofs might not reach her. Then, finally\\n\\nAnd they had left to come thither two fine estates in, Virginia--namely these two: Laurel Creek, which was Mary's, mother's in her own right, and Drake Hill; and the second wife had, come with some misgiving and attended by a whole troop of black, slaves, which made all our country fall agog at once with awe and, ridicule and admiration. I was myself full of interest in this, unwonted folk, and prone to linger about the park for a sight, and, maybe a chance word with them, having ever from a child had a desire, to look farther into that which has been hitherto unknown, whether, it be in books or in the world at large. My lessons had been learned, that morning, as was easily done, for I was accounted quick in, learning, though no more so than others, did they put themselves to, it with the same wish to have it over. My tutor also was not one to, linger unduly at the task of teaching, since he was given to, rambling about by himself with a book under one arm and a fish-pole, over shoulder; a scholar of gentle, melancholy moving through the, world, with such frequent pauses of abstraction that I used often to, wonder if he rightfully knew himself whither he was bound.\\n\\nIt was late when the ball was done, but Mary would have stayed it, out had it not been for Catherine, who almost swooned in the middle, of a dance and had to be revived with aromatic vinegar, and lie for, a while in my Lady Culpeper's bedchamber, with a black woman fanning, her, until she was sufficiently recovered to go home. Mary did not, espy me until, returning from her sister's side to order the sedan, chairs, she jostled against me. Then such a blush of delight and, relief came over her face as made my heart stand still with rapture, and something like fear. \\\"You here, you here, Harry?\\\" she cried, and, stammered and blushed again, and Sir Humphrey and Cicely, who were, pressing up, looked at me jealously.\\n\\nBut my mother was fond of him and so was my brother John, and as for, my stepfather, Col. John Chelmsford, he had too weighty matters upon, his mind, matters which pertained to Church and State and life and, death, to think much about tutors. I myself was not averse to Master, Snowdon, though he was to my mind, which was ever fain to seize, knowledge as a man and a soldier should, by the forelock instead of, dallying, too mild and deprecatory, thereby, perhaps, letting the, best of her elude him. Still Master Snowdon was accounted, and was\\n\\nthough some of them were for her daughter Cate, who was fair enough., Nothing would do but Mistress Mary, with her lovely face still, strange to see with her consternation of puzzlement, should, severally display every piece to her grandmother, and hold against, her complexion the rich stuffs to see if the colours suited her., Madam Cavendish was pleased to express her satisfaction with them, all, though with some demur at the extravagance. \\\"'Tis rich enough a, wardrobe for my Lady Culpeper,\\\" said she, at which innocent, shrewdness I was driven to hard straits to keep my face grave, but, Mistress Catherine was looking on with a countenance as calm as the, moon which was just then rising.\\n\\nShe stared with scorn at the one black woman approaching her with, the silver tray, then she turned and stared at Nick Barry, sitting, half overcome with drink, lolling against the other. He cast a look, of utter sheepishness at her, and then straightened himself, and, rose like the other men, and Dick Barry motioned to both of the, black women to withdraw, which they did, slinking out darkly, both, with a fine rustle of silks. Then Madam Story saluted the other, women, though somewhat stiffly, and Dick Barry, who was never, lacking in a certain gloomy dignity, though they said him to be the, worse of the two brothers, stepped forward. \\\"Madam,\\\" he said, \\\"I, pray you to be seated.\\\" With that he led her with a courtly air to a, great carved chair, in which his father had been used to sit, and, she therein, somewhat mollified, her black length doubled on itself\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Harry, Harry,\\\" she sobbed out, \\\"know you not that is why I, cannot bear it longer, because you yourself bear it with no, complaint?\\\" Then she sobbed and even wailed with that piteousness of, the grief of age exceeding that of infancy, inasmuch as the weight, of all past griefs of a lifetime go to swell it, and it is enhanced, by memory as well as by the present and an unknown future. I knew, not what to do, but laid a hand somewhat timidly on one of her thin, silken arms, and strove to draw it gently from her face. \\\"Madam, Cavendish,\\\" I said, \\\"indeed you mistake if you weep for me. At this, moment I would change places with no man in Virginia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sir Humphrey,\\\" I whispered back, while Mary's sweet voice in the, mare's delicate ear sounded like a song, \\\"sometimes an unguessed, riddle hath less weight than a guessed one, and some fish of, knowledge had best be left in the stream. I tell thee she is safe.\\\", So saying, I looked him full in his honest, boyish face, which was, good to see, though sometime I wished, for the maid's sake, that it, had more shrewdness of wit in it. Then he gave me a great grasp of, the hand, and whispered something hoarsely. \\\"Thou art a good fellow\\n\\nI know not how it may be with other men, but of one branch of, knowledge, which pertains directly to the human heart, and, when it, be what its name indicates, to its eternal life, I gained no insight, whatever from my books and my lessons, nor from my observance of its, workings in those around me, and that was the passion of love. Of, that I truly could learn naught except by turning my reflections, toward my own heart.\\n\\n\\\"What means that hurt on your shoulder, Harry?\\\" asked my, stepfather, Col. John Chelmsford, and his voice was kind enough, then. \\\"I would not have laid such a heavy hand on thy shoulder had I, known of it,\\\" he added. My stepfather had never aught against me, that I wot of, having simply naught for me, and a man cannot in, justice be held to account for the limitations of his affections\\n\\nI hastened on my way to Barry Upper Branch, where was the, rendezvous, and on my way had to pass the house where dwelt that, woman of strange repute, Margery Key, and it was naught but a, solidity of shadow beside the road except for a glimmer of white, from the breast of her cat in the doorway. But as I live, as I rode, past, a voice came from that house, though how she knew me in that, gloom I know not.\\n\\n, I truly think that if Parson Downs had informed me that I was to be, put to the rack or lose my head it would not have so cut me to the, heart. Something there was about a gentleman of England being set in, the stocks which detracted not only from the dignity of the, punishment, but that of the offence. I would not have believed they, would have done that to me, and can hardly believe it now. Such a, punishment had never entered into my imagination, I being a, gentleman born and bred, and my crime being a grave one, whereas the, stocks were commonly regarded for the common folk, who had committed, petty offences, such as swearing or Sabbath-breaking. I could not, for some time realise it, and lay staring at Parson Downs, while he, tried to force the Burgundy upon me and stared in alarm at my, paleness.\\n\\n\\\"For shame!\\\" she said, standing over me, with her face as white as, death, but with resolution in her eyes, \\\"for shame, Harry Wingfield!, Full easy it is to be brave on the battlefield, but it takes a hero, to quail not when his vanity be assailed. Have not as good men as, thou, and better, sat in the stocks? And think you that it will make, any difference to us, except as we suffer with you? And 'tis harder, for my poor sister than for thee, but she makes no complaint, nor, sheds a tear, but goes about with her face like the dead, and such a, look in her eyes as never I saw there before. And she told me to say, to thee that she could not come to-day, but that she would make, amends, and that thou hadst no cause to overworry, and I know not, what she meant, but this much I do know, a brave man is a brave man, whether it be the scaffold or the stocks, and--and--thou, hast gotten thyself into a fever, Harry.\\\"\\n\\nMary Cavendish gathered up her blue and silver petticoats about her, as closely as a blue flower-bell at nightfall, and stepped along, daintily at my side, and the feel of her little hand on my arm, seemed verily the only touch of material things which held me to, this world. We came to a great pool of wet in our way, and suddenly, I thought of her feet in her little satin shoes. \\\"Madam, you will, wet your feet if you walk through that pool in your satin shoes,\\\" I, said, and my voice was so hoarse with tenderness that I would not, have known it for my own, and I felt her arm tremble. \\\"No,\\\" she said, faintly. But without waiting for any permission, around her waist I, put an arm, and had her raised in a twinkling from the ground, and, bore her across the pool, she not struggling, but only whispering, faintly when I set her down after it was well passed. \\\"You--you, should not have done that, Harry.\\\"\\n\\nI still stared at her, not knowing in truth what to say. Then, suddenly she caught at my hands with hers, and cried out with that, energy that I saw all at once the fire of life beneath that fair, show of maiden peace and calm of hers, \\\"Harry, Harry Wingfield, if, my grandmother, Madam Cavendish, knows this, my sister is undone; no, pity will she have. Straight to the governor will she go, though she, hobble on crutches to Jamestown! She would starve ere she would move, against the will of the king and his representative, and so would I\\n\\nI reasoned it out within myself that one cause might lie in that, distrust and suspicion of his neighbour as to his good-will and, identical interest with himself which is inborn with every man, and, in most cases strengthens with his growth. When a movement of, rebellion against authority is on foot, he eyes all askance, and, speaks in whispering corners of secrecy, not knowing when he strikes, his first blow whether his own brother's hand will be with him, against the common tyrant, or against himself.\\n\\nwho had come with his goods to see to their safety. Both men were, pacing back and forth, smoking long pipes, and Captain Watson, of, the Earl of Fairfax, a small and eager-spoken man, turned on me the, minute I came within hearing. \\\"Where be my Lady Culpeper's goods?\\\", said he; \\\"'tis time they were here and I on my way to the ship., Devil take me if I run such a risk again for any man.\\\"\\n\\nSir Humphrey was a well-set young gentleman, and he was dressed in, the farthest fashion. The broad back of his scarlet coat, rising to, the trot of his horse, clashed through the soft gold-green mists and, radiances of the spring landscape like the blare of a trumpet; his, gold buttons glittered; the long plume on his hat ruffled to the, wind over his fair periwig. Wigs were not so long in fashion, but, Sir Humphrey was to the front in his. Mary Cavendish and Sir, Humphrey rode on abreast, and I behind far enough to be cleared of, the mire thrown by their horse-hoofs, and my heart was full of that, demon of jealousy which possessed me in spite of my love. It is, passing strange that I, though loving Mary Cavendish better than, myself, and having the strength to prefer her to myself in all, things, yet had not the power to do it without pain, and must hold, that ravening jealousy to my breast. But not once did it get the, better of me, and all the way was I, even then, thinking that Sir, Humphrey Hyde might be good man and true for Mary Cavendish to wed\\n\\nbut only last because the road was blocked, for verily I thought his, plunging horse would have all before him under his feet. They were, all past me in a trice like a dream, the May revellers scattering, and hastening forward with shrieks of terror and shouts of rage and, peals of defiant laughter, and Captain Jaynes' voice, like a, trumpet, overbearing everything, and shouts from the Barry brothers, echoing him, and now and then coming the deep rumble of, expostulations from the parson's great chest, and Ralph Drake's, peals of horse-laughter, and I was left to consider what a, tinder-box this Colony of Virginia was, and how ready to leap to, flame at a spark even when seemingly most at peace, and to regard, with more and more anxiety Mary Cavendish's part in this brewing, tumult.\\n\\nand the other maids going their ways unattended, with faces of, averted meekness, or haughty uplifts of brows and noses, as suited, best their different characters. Mistress Mary was, no doubt, the, fairest of them all, and yet there was more than that in the cause, for her advantage over them. She kept all her admirers by the very, looseness of her grasp, which gave no indication of any eagerness to, hold, and thus aroused in them no fear of detention nor of wiles of, beauty which should subvert their wills. And, furthermore, Mary, Cavendish distributed her smiles as impartially as a flower its, sweetness, to each the same, though but a scant allotment to each\\n\\nAnd I know not how this also may be with other men, but love with me, had a beginning, though not an end and never shall have, and a, completeness of growth which makes it visible to my thought like the, shape of an angel. I have loved not in one way, but in every way, which the heart of man could conceive. There is no tone of love, which the heart holds for the striking which I have not heard like a, bell through my furthermost silences. I can truly say that when I, rode to church with Mary Cavendish that morning in April, though I, loved in my whole life her and her alone, and was a most solitary, man as far as friends and kinsfolk went, yet not one in the whole, Kingdom of Virginia had fuller knowledge of love in all its shades, of meaning than I. For I had loved Mary Cavendish like a father and, like a lover, like a friend and a brother, like a slave and like a, master, and such love I had for her that I could see her good beyond, her pain, and would have had the courage to bear her pain, though, God knows her every pang was my twenty. And it had been thus with me, near sixteen years, since I was fourteen and she was a little maid, of two, and I lived neighbour to her in Suffolkshire. I can see, myself at fourteen and laugh at the picture. All of us have our, phases of comedy, our seasons when we are out of perspective and, approach the grotesque and furnish our own jesters for our after, lives.\\n\\nLocust Creek was not a large plantation, but the fields of tobacco, were well set, and it was some task to cut them. Captain Jaynes, essayed to form the cutters into ranks, but with no avail, though he, galloped back and forth, shouting like a madman. Every man set to, work for himself, and it was again bedlam broke loose as at the, other plantation. Then indeed for the first time I saw Mary, Cavendish shrink a little, as if she were somewhat intimidated by, the fire which she had lighted, and she resisted not, when Sir, Humphrey, and her Cousin Ralph and I, urged her into the house. And, as she entered, there was Catherine, having been brought thither by, that stranger who had disappeared. And we shut the door upon both, women, and then felt freer in our minds. Capt. Noel Jaynes swore, 'twas a jade fit to lead an army, then inquired what in hell brought, her thither, and why women were to the front in all our Virginian, wars, whether they wore white aprons or not?\\n\\nSo it was arranged that the four were to meet me that very night, after sunset and before moonrise, and move the goods, and I mounted, and rode away, with Parson Downs shouting after me his proposition, to trade horses, and even offering ten pounds to boot when he saw, the splendid long pace of my thoroughbred flinging out his legs with, that freest motion of anything in the world, unless it be the swift, upward cleave of a bird when the fluttering of wing wherewith he, hath gained his impetus hath ceased, and nothing except that, invincible rising is seen.\\n\\nclad in a little straight white gown and little satin shoes, and a, wreath of roses on her head, from whence the golden locks flowed, over her gentle cheeks, delicately rounded between the baby and, maiden curves, with her little hands clasped before her; and her, blue eyes, now downcast, now uplifted with utmost confidence in the, love of all who saw her. And close by her stood her sister, Catherine, coldly sweet in a splendid spread of glittering brocade\\n\\nI should most assuredly have fought with that brave man myself, for, 'twas a good cause, and one which has been good since the beginning, of things, and will hold good till the end--the cause of the, poor and down-trod against the tyranny of the rich and great. No, greater man will there ever be in this new country of America than, Nathaniel Bacon, though he had but twenty weeks in which to prove, his greatness; had he been granted more he might well have changed, history. I can see now that look of high command which none could, withstand, for leaders of men are born, as well as poets and kings\\n\\nMadam Cavendish gazed at her with that rapture of admiration in a, beloved object which can almost glorify age to youth. She called, Mary to her and stroked the rich folds of her gown; she straightened, a flutter of ribbon. \\\"'Tis a fine stuff of the gown,\\\" she said, \\\"and, blue was always my colour. I was married in it. 'Tis fine enough for, the governor's wife, or the queen for that matter.\\\" She pulled out a, fold so that a long trail of silver flowers caught the light and, gleamed like frost. No misgivings and no suspicions she had, and, none, by that time, had Mary, believing as she did that her sister, had bought all that bravery for her, and that it was hers by right\\n\\nand had to be dragged into the present doings by the very hair of, his head by his wife, and that was not all. Yes, that was not all., Then, with that, up she flung one stout foot, and lo, a great hole, was in the heel of her stocking, and the other, and then she flirted, the hem of her petticoat into sight, and that was all of a fringe, with rags. \\\"Look, look!\\\" she shrieked out. \\\"I tell ye, Thomas, Longman, I will have them look, and see to what a pass that cursed, Navigation Act and the selling of the tobacco for naught, hath, brought a decent woman. How long is it since I had a new petticoat?, How long, I pray? Oh, Lord, had the men of this colony but the, spirit of the women! Had but brave Nat Bacon lived!\\\" With that, this, woman, who had been perchance drinking too much beer for her head\\n\\nShe fairly wrung her hands in her helpless wrath, and the gems, glittered anew. \\\"But, but,\\\" she stammered out, \\\"know you the full, result of this, Harry Wingfield? She, my sister Mary, thinks that, I--I--sent to England for the goods for her; she knows that, I have some acquaintance with what she hath done, and she--she, is blessing me for it, and I cannot deny what she thinks., I--I--cannot tell her what you, you have done, lest, lest--\\\", To my great astonishment she stopped short with such a flame of, blushes as I had never seen on her face before, and I was at, a loss to know what she might mean, but supposed that she, considered that the shame of Mistress Mary's wearing finery which, had been paid for out of a convict's purse would be more than she, could put upon her, and yet that she dared not inform her, lest she, refuse to wear the sky-blue robe to the governor's ball, and so, anger Madam Cavendish.\\n\\nCatherine did not move to go when the people drew away from her, but, rather stood looking at them with that lurking fire in her eyes and, a flush on her fair cheeks. Mistress Mary sat on her horse, curbing, him with her little hand, and her golden curls floated around her, like a cloud, for she had ridden forth without her hood on hearing, the sound of the horns and bells, eager to see the show like any, child, and the merrymakers stared at her, grinning with uncouth, delight and never any resentment. There was that in Mary Cavendish's, look, when she chose to have it so, that could, I verily believe\\n\\nI followed him back to the house, and he sprang from his saddle, had, a shutter unhasped in a twinkling, knowing evidently the secret of, it, and we were inside, standing amongst the litter of casks and, cases in the great silent desertion of the hall of Locust Creek., Then he grasped me hard by both hands, and cried out, \\\"Harry, Harry, Wingfield, come to thee I must, for, convict though thou be, thou, art a man with a head packed with wit, and Ralph Drake is half the, time in his cups, and Parson Downs riding his own will at such a, hard gallop that 'twill surprise me not if he leave his head behind\\n\\nWhen I reached the wharf, with my horse all afoam, there was indeed, the Golden Horn down the river, coming in. The tide and the wind had, been against her, or she would have reached shore ere now. Then, along the bank I urged my horse, and in some parts, where there was, no footing and the tangle of woods too close, into the stream we, plunged and swam, then up bank again, and so on with a mighty, splatter of mire and water and rain of green leaves and blossoms, from the low hang of branches through which we tore way, till we, came abreast of the Golden Horn. Then I hallooed, first making sure, that there was no one lurking near to overhear, and waved my, handkerchief, keeping my horse standing to his fetlocks in the, current, until over the water came an answering halloo from the, Golden Horn, and I could plainly see Captain Calvin Tabor on the, quarter-deck. The ship was not far distant, and I could have swam to, her, and would have, though the tide was strong, had there been no, other way.\\n\\nOften one cut a finger, but went on with blood flowing, and their, hair begun to fly loose, and they smeared their faces with their cut, hands, and as for the two black women, they pounced upon those green, plants with fierce swashes of their gleaming knives, and though they, could have sensed little about the true reason for it all, worked, with a fury of savagery which needed no motive only its first, impetus of motion.\\n\\nthough she was constrained to speak to me. But I, and I speak the, truth, since I held it unworthy a man and a gentleman to feel aught, of wrath or contempt when he was sole sufferer by reason of any, wrong done by a woman, had nothing but that ever recurrent surprise, and unbelief at the sight of her, to reconcile what I knew, or, thought I knew, with what she seemed.\\n\\nwhich seemed younger than my years, and was strangely free from any, recording lines of experiences which might have been esteemed bitter, by any one who had not the pride of bearing them. When my black, eyes, which had a bold daring in them, looked forth at me from the, glass, and my lips smiled with a gay confidence at me, I could not, but surmise that my whole face was as a mask worn unwittingly over a, grave spirit. But since a man must be judged largely by his outward, guise and I had that of a gay young blade, I need not have taken it, amiss if Catherine Cavendish had that look in her eyes when I set, forth with her young sister alone save for those dark people which, some folk believed to have no souls.\\n\\nthe roots of herbs, and Latin verbs and algebraic quantities, and, evil and good, but of their bearing upon the human heart. That I, have ever held to be the most important knowledge of all, and the, only reason for the setting of those lessons which must pass like, all things mortal, and can only live in so far as they have turned, that part of the scholar, which has hold of immortality, this or, that way.\\n\\nwhich many affirmed to be her familiar, spring from her door like a, white arrow of speed and off down a wood-path, and my horse reared, and plunged, and then, with my holding him of no avail, though I had, a strong hand on the bridle, was after her with such a mad flight, that I had hard work to keep the saddle. Pell-mell through the wood, we went, I ducking my head before the mad lash of the branches and, feeling the dew therefrom in my face like a drive of rain, until we, came to a cleared space, then a great spread of tobacco fields\\n\\nWhen we were fairly in the open of Major Beverly's plantation some, few torches were lit, and then I saw that we were indeed a good, hundred strong, and of the party were that old graybeard who had, played Maid Marion on Mayday, and many of the Morris dancers, and, those lusty lads and lasses, and they had been at the cider this, time as at the other, but all had their wits at their service.\\n\\nwhat I had done. And she hath heard me say, that I know well, that I, thought 'twas a noble list of Lady Culpeper's, and I wished I were a, governor's wife or daughter, that I could have such fine things. I, remember me well that I told her thus before ever the Golden Horn, sailed for England, that time after Cicely Hyde slept with me and, told me what she had from Cate Culpeper. A goodly portion of the, goods were for Cate. 'Twas Catherine. Oh, the sweetheart, the, darling! Was there ever sister like her?\\\"\\n\\nWith that she touched Merry Roger with her whip and was off at a, gallop, and I abreast, inwardly laughing, for I well understood that, this persistency on other and stirring topics, and sudden flight, when they failed, was to keep me from the subject of the powder and, ammunition unladen that morning from the \\\"Golden Horn.\\\" But she need, not have taken such pains, for I, while in church, had resolved, within myself not to question her further, lest she tell me, something which might do her harm were I forced, for her good, to, reveal it, but to demand the meaning of all this from Sir Humphrey, Hyde, who, I was convinced, knew as much as she.\\n\\nJarvis Field was a green tract, clear of trees, not far from us, and, presently we met the merry company proceeding thither. First came a, great rollicking posse of lads and lasses linked hand in hand, all, crowned with flowers, and bearing green and blossomy boughs over, shoulder. And these were so swift with the wild spirit and jollity, of the day that they must needs come in advance, even before the, horses which dragged the May-pole. Six of them there were, so, bedecked with ribbons and green garlands that I marvelled they could, see the road and were not wild with fear. But they seemed to enter, into the spirit of it all, and stepped highly and daintily with, proud archings of necks and tossings of green plumed heads, and, behind them the May-pole rasped and bumped and grated, the trunk of, a mighty oak yet bristling with green, like the stubble of a shaggy, beard of virility. And after the May-pole came surely the queerest, company of morris dancers that ever the world saw, except those of, which I have heard tell which danced in Herefordshire in the reign, of King James, those being composed of ten men whose ages made up, the sum of twelve hundred years. These, while not so ancient as, that, were still of the oldest men to be come at who could move, without crutches and whose estate was not of too much dignity for, such sports. And Maid Marion was the oldest and smallest of them, all, riding her hobby-horse, dressed in a yellow petticoat and a, crimson stomacher, with a great wig of yellow flax hanging down, under her gilt crown, and a painted mask to hide her white beard., And after Maid Marion came dancing, with stiff struts and, gambols, old men as gayly attired as might be, with garlands of, peach-blossoms on their gray heads, bearing gad-sticks of peeled, willow-boughs wound with cowslips, and ringing bells and blowing, horns with all their might. And after them trooped young men and, maids, all flinging their heels aloft and waving with green and, flowers, and shouting and singing till it seemed the whole colony, was up and mad.\\n\\nhave done honour to his heart, fetched out a flask of brandy from, his pocket, and bade Will Wickett find a mug somewhere, which he did, speedily, and he gave me a drink which put new life into me, though, it was still out of the question for me to ride that fiery horse, which stood pawing outside the prison. And just here I would like to, say that I never forgot, nor ceased to be grateful for the kindly, interest in me, and the risk which the parson was disposed to take, for my sake that day. A great risk indeed it would have been, and, would doubtless have cost him his living, had I ridden across, country on that famous horse of his; but he seemed not to think of, that, but shook his head sadly after I had swallowed the brandy, and, then my brother John came in and he turned to him.\\n\\nthe great Edward Maria Wingfield, the president of the first council, of the Dominion of Virginia, having written a book which was held to, be notable. This imagination for the setting forth and adorning of, all common things and happenings, and my woman's name of Maria, my, whole name being Harry Maria Wingfield, through my ancestor having, been a favourite of a great queen, and so called for her honour\\n\\nthough it was none of theirs. The sight aroused my anger, but Mary, Cavendish did not seem to see any occasion for wrath. She sat her, prancing horse, her head up, and her curls streaming like a flag of, gold, and there was a blue flash in her eyes, of which I knew the, meaning. The blood of her great ancestor, the sea king, Thomas, Cavendish, who was second only to Sir Francis Drake, was astir, within her. She sat there with the salt sea wind in her nostrils\\n\\nas I touched her in the narrow way, her mood changed, and the woman, in her came uppermost, though not to her shaking. But she caught, hold of my right arm with her two little hands and pressed her fair, cheek against my shoulder with that modest boldness of a maid when, she is assured of love, and whispered: \\\"Harry, if the militia is, ordered out they say they will not fire, but--if thou be wounded\\n\\nI nodded. I knew it well, and had heard it from a lad how Ralph, Cavendish's own mother had turned him from her door one night with, the king's troops in the neighbourhood, though it was afterward, argued that she did not know of that, and he had been taken before, morning and afterwards executed, and she had never said a word nor, shed a tear that any one saw.\\n\\nWhen he came upon us he stared for but one second, then came that, black flash into his eyes, and out curved an arm, and the little, maid was on her father's shoulder, and he was questioning me with, something of mistrust. I was a gentleman born and bred, but my, clothes sat but roughly and indifferently on me, partly through lack, of oversight and partly from that rude tumble I had gotten. Indeed\\n\\nI sat me down on a glittering ridge of rock near the river-bank, and, watched the blue run of the water, and twisted the matter this and, that way in my mind, for I was sorely perplexed. Never did I feel as, then the hamper of my position, for a man who was held in such, esteem as I by some and contempt by others, and while having voice, had no authority to maintain it, was neither flesh nor fowl nor, slave nor master. Madam Cavendish treated me in all respects as the, equal of herself and her family--nay, more than that, she, deferred to me in such fashion as I had never seen in her toward any, one, but Catherine treated me ever with iciness of contempt, which I, at that time conceived to be but that transference of blame from her, own self to a scapegoat of wrong-doing which is a resort of ignoble, souls. They will have others not only suffer for their own sin, but, even treat them with the scorn due themselves. And not one man was, there in the colony, excepting perhaps Sir Humphrey Hyde and Parson, Downs and the brothers Nicholas and Richard Barry, which last were, not squeamish, and would have had me as boon companion at Barry, Upper Branch, having been drawn to me by a kindred boldness of, spirit and some little passages which I had had with the Indians\\n\\nAnd verily Mary Cavendish did for a minute seem to blush as she cast, a glance at herself in the mirror and saw her marvellous rose of a, face, but the next minute the mirror flashed in the grass and her, arms were about Cicely Hyde's neck. \\\"'Tis the dearest face in, Virginia, Cicely,\\\" said she, in her sweet, vehement way, and laid, her pink cheek against the other's plain one. And Cicely laughed\\n\\nand her hair flung upon it like a pennant of victory, and looked at, the ship wet with the ocean surges, the sails stiff with the rime of, salt, and the group of English sailors on the deck, and those old, ancestral instincts which constitute the memory of the blood awoke., She was in that instant as she sat there almost as truly that ardent, Suffolkshire lad, Thomas Cavendish, ready to ride to the death the, white plungers of the sea, and send the Spanish Armada to the, bottom, as Mary Cavendish of Drake Hill, the fairest maid of her, time in the Colony of Virginia.\\n\\n\\\"Nay, that I will not,\\\" cried the other. \\\"By the Lord, I forgot thy, conscience, good Dick. Well, I have enough from my ancestors of, Plymouth to forswear and forswear again, and yet have some to spare., I--I will go to my Lady Culpeper with the tale and save thy soul, thy scruples, and thy ears the melody of her tongue. I will acquaint, her with the miscarriage of the goods, and whisper of the sick, sailor, and all thou hast to do is to loiter about Jamestown\\n\\nEver since that time I have wondered whether mankind hath any bodily, ills which are not dependent upon the mind for their existence, and, are so curable by some sore stress of it. For verily, though my, wounds were not healed, and though I had not left my bed for a long, time, and my seat was both rough and hard, and my feet were rudely, pinioned between the boards, and the sun was blistering with that, damp blister which frets the soul as well as the flesh, I seemed to, sense nothing, except the shame and disgrace of my estate. As for my, bodily ailments, they might have been cured, for aught I knew of, them. To this time, when I lay me down to sleep after a harder day's, work than ordinary, I can see and hear the jeers of that rude crowd, around the stocks. Truly, after all, a man's vanity is his point of, vantage, and I wonder greatly if that be not the true meaning of the, vulnerable spot in Achilles's heel. Some slight dignity, though I, had not so understood it, I had maintained in the midst of my, misfortunes. To be a convict of one's free will, to protect the maid, of one's love from grief, was one thing, but to sit in the stocks\\n\\nShe looked from one to the other of us, and laughed gayly and shook, her head, and her golden curls flew to the wind, and she touched, Merry Roger with her whip and he bounded ahead, and we had all we, could do to keep pace, he being fresh. Then Parson Downs pelted to, her side and besought her to turn, and so did Captain Jaynes, though, he was half laughing with delight at her spirit, and his bright eyes, viewed her in such wise that I could scarce keep my fingers from his, throat. But Mary Cavendish would hear to none, and no way there was, of turning her, lest we dragged her from her saddle.\\n\\nand partly because, as I said before, whether witch or not, she was, aged and feeble, and ill fitted for such work, I leapt from my, saddle and gathered her another armful of fagots, and laid them on, her hearth. I left the old soul shedding such tears of gratitude, over that slight service and calling down such childish blessings, upon my head that I began to have little doubt that she was no, witch, but only a poor and solitary old woman, which to my mind is, the forlornest state of humanity. How a man fares without those of, his own flesh and blood I can understand, since a man must needs, have some comfort in his own endurance of hardships, but what a, woman can do without chick or child, and no solace in her own, dependency, I know not. Verily I know not that such be to blame if, they turn to Satan himself for a protector, as they suspected, Margery Key of doing.\\n\\nI called again, but no one came, and presently I quit and lay with, the burning eye of the sun in my face and that pestilent buzz of, flies in my ears, and my weakness and pain so increasing upon my, consciousness, that I heeded them not so much. I shut my eyes and, that torrid sunbeam burned red through my lids, and I wondered if, they had found out aught concerning Mary Cavendish, and I wondered, not so much what they would do with me, since I was so weak and, spent with loss of blood that nothing that had to do with me seemed, of much moment.\\n\\nI trow it seemed a shame, as it ever does, to invoke that terrible, force of the world which man controls, whether to his liberty or his, slavery 'tis the question, and bring destruction upon all that fair, inflorescence of life. But sometimes death and destruction are the, means to life and immortality. Those great fields of Major Robert, Beverly's lay before us in the full moonlight, overlapping with the, lusty breadth of the new leaves gleaming with silver dew, and upon, them we fell. We hacked and cut, we tore up by the roots. In a trice, we were bedlam loosened--that is, the ruder part of us. Some of, us worked with no less fury, but still with some sense of our own, dignity as destroyers over destruction. But the rabble who had, swelled our ranks were all on fire with rage, and wasted themselves, as well as the tobacco. They filled the air with shouts and wild, screams and peals of laughter. That fiercest joy of the world, the, joy of destruction, was upon them, and sure it must have been one of, the chiefest of the joys of primitive man, for all in a second it, was as if the centuries of civilisation and Christianity had gone, for naught, and the great gulf which lies back of us to the past had, been leapt. One had doubted it not, had he seen those old men, tearing up the tobacco plants, their mouths dribbling with a slow, mutter of curses, for they had drunk much cider, and being aged, and, none too well fed, it had more hold on them than on some of the, others; and to see the women lost to all sense of decency, with, their petticoats girded high on account of the dew, striding among, the plants with high flings of stalwart legs, then slashing right, and left with an uncertainty of fury which threatened not only, themselves but their neighbours as well as the tobacco, and, shrieking now and then, regardless of who might hear, \\\"Down with the, king!\\\"\\n\\nAs for me, the principal thought in my mind when the militia burst, upon us, was the safety of Mary Cavendish. Straight to the door of, the great house I rushed, and Sir Humphrey Hyde was with me. As for, the other gentlemen, they were fighting here and there as they, could, Captain Jaynes making efforts to keep the main body of the, defenders at his back, but with little avail. I stood against the, door of the house, resolved upon but one course--that my dead, body should be the threshold over which they crossed to Mary, Cavendish. It was but a pitiful resolve, for what could I do, single-handed, except for the boy Humphrey Hyde, against so many., But it was all, and a man can but give his all. I knew if the, militia were to find Mary and Catherine Cavendish in that house\\n\\npressing his body hard against the trees that I might hold back a, branch which would have caught her headgear. All the way we never, spoke. When we reached Laurel Creek, Mistress Mary drew the key from, her pocket, which showed to me that the visit had been planned, should the ship have arrived. She unlocked the door, and the, sailors, no longer singing, for they were well-nigh spent by the, journey under the heavy burdens, deposited the cases in the great, room. Laurel Creek had belonged to Mistress Mary's maternal, grandfather, Colonel Edmond Lane, and had not been inhabited this, many a year, not since Mary was a baby in arms. The old furniture, still stood in the accustomed places, looking desolate with that, peculiar desolateness of lifeless things which have been associated, with man. The house at Laurel Creek was a fine mansion, finer than, Drake Hill, and the hall made me think of England. Great oak chests, stood against the walls, hung with rusting swords and armour and, empty powder-horns. A carven seat was beside the cold hearth, and in, a corner was a tall spinning-wheel, and the carven stair led in a, spiral ascent of mystery to the shadows above.\\n\\nI know that you are what you are, a convict and an exile, to shield, Catherine, to shield a granddaughter of mine, who should be in your, place. Harry Wingfield, I know that Catherine Cavendish is guilty of, the crime for which you are in punishment, and, woe is me, such is, my pride, such is my wicked pride, that I have let you suffer and, said never one word.\\\"\\n\\nI replied that she was hourly expected by what I had learned; then, Captain Tabor, sitting loosely hunched with that utter abandon of, all the muscles which one sees in some when they are undergoing a, fierce strain of thought, remained silent for a space, his brows, knitted. Then suddenly my shoulder tingled with the clap which he, gave it, and the cabin rang and rang again with a laugh so loud and, gay that it seemed a very note of the May day. \\\"You are merry,\\\" I, said, but I laughed myself, though somewhat doubtfully, when he, unfolded his scheme to me, which was indeed both bold and humorous., He knew well the captain of the Earl of Fairfax, who had been, shipmate with him.\\n\\ndoth, while it not for one moment alters the truth and constancy of, his love, yet allay for the time his selfish thirst for it. While I, was ready as ever to die for Mary Cavendish, and while the thought, of her was as ever in my inmost soul, yet that effervescence of, warlike spirit within me had rendered me not forgetful, but somewhat, unwatchful of a word and a look of hers. And for the time being that, sad question of our estates, which forbade more than our loves, had, seemed to pale in importance before this matter of maybe the rising, or falling of a new empire. Heart and soul was I in this cause, and, gave myself the rein as I had longed to do for the cause of, Nathaniel Bacon.\\n\\n\\\"No, and never will,\\\" cried I, so fervently and so echoing to the, full his youthful enthusiasm that again that keen look flashed into, his eyes. \\\"Harry,\\\" he stammered out, \\\"you do not--say, for God's, sake, Harry, you are a man if you are a--a--, and every day, have you seen that angel, and--and--Harry, may the devil, take me if I would go against thee if she--you know I would not\\n\\nstanding back on her heels with a marvellous dignity, and waving one, long, black-draped arm. \\\"Gentlemen of Virginia,\\\" said she, in a, voice of such solemnity as I had never heard excelled, \\\"I beseech, you to remember the example which that hero who has departed set, you. I beseech you to form your proceedings after the fashion of, those of the immortal Bacon, and remember that if the time comes, when a woman's arm is needed to strike for freedom, here is one at, your service, while the heart which moves it beats true to liberty, and the great dead!\\\"\\n\\nAs we rode along in silence, if any man spoke, Captain Jaynes, quieted him with a great oath smothered in his chest, as if by a bed, of feathers, and presently I became aware that there were more of us, than when we started. We swarmed through the woods, our company, being swelled invisibly from every side, and not only men but women, were there. Both Mistress Allgood and Mistress Longman were pressing, on with their petticoats tucked up, and to my great surprise both of, the black women who lived at Barry Upper Branch. They slunk along, far to the rear, with knives gleaming like white fire at their, girdles, keeping well out of sight of the Barry brothers, who were, both of our party, and looking for all the world like two female, tigers of some savage jungle in search of prey, since both moved, with a curious powerful crouch of secrecy as to her back and hips\\n\\n\\\"'Twill give thee heart, Harry,\\\" he said, \\\"and surely now thy wounds, be so far healed, 'twill not inflame them, and in any case, why, should good spirit inflame wounds? Faith, and I believe not in so, much bleeding and so little stimulating. I'll be damned, Harry, if I, see what is left to inflame in thee, not a hint of colour in thy, long face. Stands it not to reason, that if no blood be left in thee, for the wounds to work upon, they must even take thy vitals? But I, am no physician. However, smoke hard as thou canst, poor Harry, if, thou wilt not drink, for I have something to tell thee, and there is, that about our good tobacco of Virginia--now we have rescued it\\n\\nneither he nor his discourse. Still he spoke with a mighty energy, and a conviction of the truth of his own words which would have, moved his hearers to better purpose had they moved himself as, regarded his daily life. But beyond a great effervescence of the, spirit, which produced a high-mounting froth of piety, like the, seething top of an ale-tankard, there came naught of it. Still was, there in him some good, or rather some lack of ill; for he was no, hypocrite, but preached openly against his own vices, then went, forth to furnish new texts for his sermon, not caring who might see, and judge him. A hearty man he was, who would lend his last shilling, or borrow his neighbour's with equal readiness, forcing one to a, certain angry liking for him because of his good-will to do that for, you which you were loth to do for him. Yet if there ever was a man, in harness to Satan as to the lusts of his flesh and his pride of, life, it was Parson Downs, in despite of his bold curvets and, prances of exhortation, which so counterfeited freedom that I doubt, not that they deceived even himself; and he felt not, the while he, was expanding his great front over his pulpit, and waving his hands\\n\\nBut when I looked out of my window that May morning, and saw that, wonderful fair world, and that heaven of blue light with rosy and, golden and green boughs blowing athwart it, and heard the whir of, looms, the calls and laughs of human life, the coo of dove, the hum, of bees, the trill of mock birds, outreaching all other heights of, joy, the clangour of the sea-birds, and the tender rustle of the, new-leaved branches in the wind, that love for me which I had seen, in the heart of the woman I had loved since I could remember, seemed, my own keynote of the meaning of life sounding in my ears above all, other sounds of bane or blessing.\\n\\nThen such a cry echoed her that I trow it might have proceeded from, a thousand throats instead of one hundred odd, and in spite of all, that Captain Jaynes could do, seconded by some few of us gentlemen, who rallied about him, but were helpless since we could not fire, upon our coadjutors, that mob swept into Beverly's stables, and, presently out leapt, plunging with terror, all his fine, thoroughbreds, the mob riding them about the fields in wild career., And one of the maddest of the riders, sitting astride and flogging, her steed with a locust branch, was Mistress Longman, while her, husband vainly fled after her, beseeching her to stop, and those, around were roaring with laughter.\\n\\nAnd while I shrank back, thinking that here was the worst sting of, all, like the sting of death, that she should see me thus, straight, up to the stocks she came, and gathering her blue and silver gown, about her, made her way in to my side, and sat there, thrusting her, two tiny feet, in their dainty shoes, through the apertures next, mine, for the stocks were made to accommodate two criminals.\\n\\nthan the hot ball and the labour at the wheel?\\\" And she gave one, look at me, and called out to Sukey that she need not speak to her, mistress, and went inside to her own work and left me to go my way., I was relieved in my mind that she did not ask me whither, since, if, she had, I should have been driven to one of those broadsides of, falsehood in a good cause for which I regret the necessity, but, admit it, and if it be to my soul's hurt, I care not, so long as I, save the other party by it.\\n\\n\\\"Art thou gone daft, sweetheart? The goods of which you gave the, list this morning, which have but now come in on the Golden Horn,\\\", spake up Catherine, sharply. I marvelled as I heard her whether it, be ease or tenderness of conscience which can appease a woman with, the letter and not the substance of the truth, for I am confident, that her keeping to the outward show of honesty in her life was no, small comfort to Catherine Cavendish.\\n\\nBut the strength I had to act in discord with it, and thrust my joy, from me, and I went to planning how I could best turn the child's, fancy from myself to some one who would be for her best good. And, yet I was not satisfied with Sir Humphrey Hyde, and wished that his, wits were quicker, and wondered if years might improve them, and if, perchance a man as honest might be found who had the keenness of, ability to be the worst knave in the country. But the boy was brave\\n\\nlying at full length upon the grass under a reddening oak with a, book under my eyes and my pocket full of nuts if, perchance, my, little sweetheart should come that way with her black nurse, I heard, suddenly Captain Cavendish's voice ring out loud and clear, as it, always did, from his practice on the quarter-deck, with something, like an oath as of righteous indignation to the effect that it was a, damned shame for the heir and the eldest son, and a lad with a head, of a scholar and the arm of a soldier, to be thrust aside so and, made so little of. Then another voice, smoothly sliding, as if to, make no friction with the other's opinions, asked of whom he spoke\\n\\n\\\"Catherine, 'twas Catherine,\\\" she cried out. \\\"She said not, but well, I know her; she would not own to it--the sweetheart. Sure a, falsehood to hide a loving deed is the best truth of the world., 'Twas Catherine, 'twas Catherine, the sweetheart, the darling. She, sent for naught for herself, and hath been saving for a year's time, and maybe sold a ring or two. Somehow she discovered about the plot\\n\\nI stood there, and looked and looked, and she still pulled up tiny, handfuls of the green grass, and never turned nor knew me near, when, suddenly there burst with a speed like a storm, and a storm indeed, it was of brute life, with loud stamps of a very fury of sound which, shook the earth as with a mighty tread of thunder, out of a thicker, part of the wood, a great black stallion on a morning gallop with, all the freedom of the spring and youth firing his blood, and one, step more and his iron hoofs would have crushed the child. But I was, first. I flung myself upon her and threw her like a feather to one, side, and that was the last I knew for a while. When I knew myself, again there was a mighty pain in my shoulder, which seemed to be the, centre of my whole existence by reason of it, and there was the feel, of baby kisses on my lips. The courage of her blood was in that tiny, maid. She had no thought of flight nor tears, though she knew not, but that black thunderbolt would return, and she knew not what my, ghastly silence meant. She had crept close to me, though she might, well have been bruised, such a tender thing she was, by the rough, fling I had given her, and was trying to kiss me awake as she did, her father. And I, rude boy, all unversed in grace and tenderness\\n\\nwhen there was a wrestling for a pair of silver knee-buckles. I, remember to this day with a curious dizziness of recollection, the, straining of those two stout wrestlers over the field, each forcing, the other with all his might, and each scarce yielding a foot, and, finally ending the strife in the same spot as where begun. I can see, now those knotted arms and writhing necks of strength, and hear, those quick pants of breath, and again it seems as then, a picture, passing before my awful reality of shame. Then two young men danced, for a pair of shoes, and the crowd gathered around them, and I was, quite deserted, and could scarcely see for the throng the rhythmic, flings of heels and tosses of heads. But when that sport was over\\n\\nand there were those who said that her familiars stole bread for her, from the plantation larders, and that often a prime ham was missed, and a cut of venison, with no explanation, but who can say? Without, doubt there are strange things in the earth, but we are all so in, the midst of them, and even a part of their workings, that we can, have no outside foothold to take fair sight thereof. Verily a man, might as well strive to lift himself by his boot-straps over a, stile.\\n\\nMadam Rosamond Cavendish was, I suppose, a beauty, though after a, strange and curious fashion, being seemingly dependent upon those, around her for it, as a chameleon is dependent for his colour upon, his surroundings. I have seen Madam Cavendish, when praised by one, she loved, or approached by the little maid, her daughter, with an, outstretch of fair little arms and a coercion of dimples toward, kisses, flash into such radiance of loveliness that, boy as I was, I, was dazzled by her. Then, on the other hand, I have seen her as, dully opaque of any meaning of beauty as one could well be. But she, loved Captain Cavendish well, and I wot he never saw her but with, that wondrous charm, since whenever he cast his eyes upon her it, must have been to awaken both reflection and true life of joy in her, face. She was so small and exceeding slim that she seemed no more, than a child, and she was not strong, having a quick cough ready at, every breath of wind, and she rode nor walked like our English, women, but lay about on cushions in the sun. Still, when she moved\\n\\na year younger than I, and how my own poor father was forgotten. But, there was no discredit to my mother, who was only a weak and gentle, woman and was tasting happiness after disappointment and sorrow, in, being borne so far out by the tide of it that she lost sight, as it, were, of her old shores. My mind was never against my mother for her, lack of love for me. But it is not hard to be lenient toward a lack, of love toward one's self, especially remembering, as I do, myself\\n\\nWe were a good hour and a half late, but there was to my mind enough, of preaching yet for my soul's good, for I thought not much of, Parson Downs nor his sermons, but I dreaded for Mistress Mary that, which might come from her tardiness and her Sabbath-breaking, if, that were discovered. I dismounted, and assisted Mistress Mary to, the horse block, and off came her black velvet mask, and she clapped, a pretty hand to her hair and shook her skirts and wiped off a mud, splash. Then up the aisle she went, and I after her and all the, people staring.\\n\\nHarry,\\\" the generous lad burst out. \\\"I would not like you for a, rival, for you are a good half foot taller than I, and you have that, about you which would make a woman run to you and think herself safe, were all the Indians in Virginia up, and you are a dark man, and I, have heard say they like that, but, but--oh, I say, Harry, 'tis, a damned shame that you are here as you are, and not as a gentleman, and a cavalier with the rest of us, for all the evidence to the, contrary and all the government to the contrary, 'tis, 'tis the way, you should be, and not a word of that charge do I believe. May the, fiends take me if I do, Harry!\\\" So saying, the lad looked at me, and, verily the tears were in his blue eyes, and out he thrust his honest, hand for me to grasp, which I did with more of comfort than I had, had for many a day, though it was the hand of a rival, and the next, minute forth he burst again: \\\"Say, Harry, if it be true that thou, art out of the running, and I believe it must be so, for how, could?--say, Harry, think you there is any chance for me?\\\"\\n\\nthat I was minded to retreat. Keep Mary Cavendish's love, when she, be wedded to thee, Harry, for there is little compromise with her, for faults, unless she loveth, and she hath found out that Cicely, Hyde betrayed the plans of the plant-cutters, and for her and Madam, Bacon her sweet tongue was like a fiery lash, and Catherine was as, bad, though silent. Catherine, unless I be greatly mistaken, will, wed thy brother John, but unless I be more greatly mistaken, she, loveth thee, and now, my poor Harry, wouldst know what they will do, to thee to-morrow?\\\"\\n\\nand had my Lord Culpeper not been for him, saying that the man was, of an honest record, she would have had him set in the stocks for, his remissness, that he had not seen to it that her goods were on, board when the ship sailed. \\\"And there goes poor Cate in her old, murrey-coloured satin petticoat,\\\" said my lady with a bitter, lengthening of her face, \\\"and there is Mary Cavendish in a, blue-flowered satin with silver, which is the very twin of the one I, ordered for Cate, and which came in on the Cavendish ship.\\\"\\n\\nsince my pupil was at her wheel. And there the two sat, keeping up, that gentle drone of industry which I have come to think of as a, note of womanhood, like the hum of a bee or the purr of a cat or the, call of a bird. They sat erect, the delicate napes of their necks, showing above their muslin kerchiefs under their high twists of, hair, for even Mary had her golden curls caught up that morning on, account of the flax-lint, and from their fair, attentive faces, nobody would have gathered what stress of mind both were in. Of a, surety there must be a quieting and calming power in some of the, feminine industries which be a boon to the soul.\\n\\nand it shall live after Jamestown is again in ashes, when the, sea-birds are calling over the sunset-waste, when the reeds are tall, in the gardens, when even the tombs are crumbling, and maybe hers, and mine among them, when the sea-gates are down and the water, washing over the sites of the homes of the cavaliers. For I have, learned that the blazon of love is the only one which holds good, forever through all the wilderness of history, and the path of love, is the only one which those that may come after us can safely follow, unto the end of the world.\\n\\nI wondered somewhat at the length of the list, as not only Mistress, Mary's wardrobe, but those of her grandmother and sister and many of, the household supplies, had to be purchased with the proceeds of the, tobacco, and that brought but scanty returns of late years, owing to, the Navigation Act, which many esteemed a most unjust measure, and, scrupled not to say so, being secure in the New World, where, disloyalty against kings could flourish without so much danger of, the daring tongue silenced at Tyburn.\\n\\nwhich she treasured longer. As for me, I having no ribbons nor, sweets nor silver buttons to give her, was fain to search the woods, and fields and the seashore for those small treasures, without money, and without price, with which nature is lavish toward the poor who, love her and attend her carefully, such as the first flowers of the, season, nuts and seed-vessels, and sometimes an empty bird's nest, and a stray bright feather and bits of bright stones, which might\\n\\n\\\"And then I went myself below, and Caterin, she would have none of, me, and made up such a face of ice when I approached, that methought, I had maybe wasted my emruld ring. So after a little up the stare I, stole, and the ring was not where I had put it. Then thinkin that, the ring had been stole, and I had neither that nor the made, I, raised a great hue and cry, and demanded that a search be maid, and, the ring was found on Master Wingfield, and he was therefor, transported, and I had my ring again, and myself knew not the true, fact of the case until a year agone. Then feeling that I had not, much longer to live, I writ this, thinking that Master Wingfield was, in a rich country, and not in sufferin, and a few months more would, make not much odds to him. The facs of the case, cousin, I knew from, Madam Cavendish's old servant woman Charlotte who came to my sister, when the Cavendishs left for Virginia, having a fear of the sea, and, later when my sister died, to my wife, and died but a year agone\\n\\nwith me and my hearties for kindling, to say naught of yourself and, a few of the best gentlemen of Virginia. I forfeit my head if I set, sail for England; naught is left for me that I see that shall save, my neck but to turn pirate and king it over the high seas. Having, swallowed a small morsel of my Puritan misgivings, what is to hinder, my bolting the whole, like an exceeding bitter pill, to my complete, purging of danger? What say you, Master Wingfield? Small reputation, have you to lose, and sure thy reckoning with powers that be leaves, thee large creditor. Will you sail with me? My first lieutenant, shall you be, and we will share the booty.\\\"\\n\\nThen arrived Major Robert Beverly and another notable man, one of, the burgesses, whose name I do to this day conceal, in consequence, of a vow to that effect, and then two more. Then Major Beverly, who, was in fact running greater risks than almost any, inasmuch as he, was Clerk of the Assembly, and was betraying more of trust, after he, had saluted Madam Story conferred privately with Dick Barry, and my, Lord Estes, and Parson Downs, with this effect. Dick Barry, with, such a show of gallantry and seriousness as never was, prevailed, upon the three ladies to forgive him his discourtesy, but hinted, broadly that in an enterprise fraught with so much danger, it were, best that none but the ruder sex should confer together, and they, departed; Mistress Longman enjoining upon her husband to remain and, deport himself like a man of spirit, and Mistress Allgood whispering, with a sharp hiss into her goodman's alarmed ear, he nodding the, while in token of assent.\\n\\nand that smoothly sliding voice I recognised as Mr. Abbot's, the, attorney's, and Captain Cavendish replied in a fashion which, astonished me, for I had no idea to whom he had referred--\\\"Harry, Maria Wingfield, the eldest son and heir of as fine and gallant a, gentleman as ever trod English soil, who is treated like the son of, a scullion by those who owe him most, and 'tis a damned shame and I, care not who hears me.\\\"\\n\\nThen to my great astonishment, since I had never seen such weakness, in her before, Catherine flung up her hands before her face and, burst into such a storm of wild weeping as never was, and fled into, the house, and Mary and I stood alone together, but only for a, second, for Mary, also casting a glance at me, then about her at the, utter loneliness and silence of the world, fled in her turn. Then I, went to my room, but not to sleep nor to think altogether of love\\n\\nknowing not how much her sister knew already, she tried to cover her, confusion, like a child denying its raid on the jam pots, while its, lips and fingers are still sticky with the stolen sweet. \\\"What think, you of my list, sweetheart?\\\" cried she, merrily. \\\"A pair of the silk, stockings and two of the breast-knots and a mask and a flowered, apron shall you have.\\\" Then out of the room she whisked abruptly\\n\\nBut he was a handsome man, as I saw even then, lying in so much pain, and weakness, and he came and stood over me, and looked at me more, kindly than I should have expected, and I could see something of our, common mother in his blue eyes. He reached down his hand and shook, the one of mine which I could muster strength to raise, and called, me brother, and hoped that I found myself better, and gave me very, many tender messages of our mother, and of his father likewise\\n\\noverlapping silver-white in the moonlight, and hamlet of negro, cabins, and then Major Robert Beverly's house, standing a mass of, shadow except for one moonlit wall, for all the family were gone to, the governor's ball. Then, as I live, that white cat of Margery, Key's led me in that mad chase around Beverly's house, and when I, came to the north side of it I saw a candle gleam in a window and, heard a baby's wail, and knew 'twas where his infant daughter was, tended, and as we swept past out thrust a black head from the, window, and a screech as savage as any wild cat's rent the peace of, the night, and I believe that the child's black nurse took us, no, doubt, for the devil himself. Then all the dogs howled and bayed\\n\\nIf Mary were suspected she knew not, but Sir Humphrey was then under, arrest and was confined on board a ship in the harbour with Major, Beverly, and his mother was daily sending billets to him to return, home, and blaming him, and not his jailors, for his disobedience., She told me, furthermore, that it was Cicely Hyde who had led the, militia to our assembly at Laurel Creek that night, and was now in a, low fever through remorse, and though she told me not, I afterward, knew why that mad maid had done such a thing--'twas because of, jealousy of me and Mary Cavendish, and she pulled down more upon her, own head thereby than she wot of.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot take them, madam,\\\" I said. Yet such was her distress I was, sorry for her, though I believed it to be rooted and grounded in, falsity, and that she had no need to regard with such disapprobation, her sister's being indebted to an English gentleman who gave her in, all honour the best he had. Yet could I not yield and take those, jewels, for more reasons than one; not only should I have lost the, dear delight of having served Mary Cavendish, but I had a memory of, wrong which would not suffer me to touch those rings, nor to allow, that innocent maid to be benefited by them, since I cannot say what, dark suspicions seized me when I looked at them.\\n\\nbut not to wash my grim man's face in May dew, but rather for a, stroll in the morning air, and the clearing of my wits for, reflection; for much I wondered what course I should take regarding, my discovery of the night before. I went down the road toward, Jamestown, and struck into the path to the wharf, the same that we, had taken the day before, but there were no masts of the Golden Horn, rising among the trees with a surprise of straightness. She had, weighed anchor and sailed away over night, and possibly before. The, more I reflected the more I understood that Mistress Mary Cavendish\\n\\nthough, after all, it is a question in my mind as to what excuse, there may be for any man outside the motives of his own deeds, and I, care not to dwell unduly, even to my own consideration, upon those, disadvantages of life which may come to a man without his cognisance, and are to be borne like any fortune of war. But I had a mother who, had small affection for me, and that was not so unnatural nor so, much to her discredit as it may sound, since she, poor thing, had, been forced into a marriage with my father when she was long in love, with her cousin. Then my father having died at sea the year after I, was born, and her cousin, who was a younger son, having come into, the estates through the deaths of both his brothers of small-pox in, one week, she married her first love in less than six months, and no, discredit to her, for women are weak when they love, and she had, doubtless been sorely tried. They told me that my poor father was a, true man and gallant soldier, and my old nurse used to talk to me of, him, and I used to go by myself to think of him, and my eyes would, get red when I was but a little boy with reflecting upon my mother, with her new husband and her beautiful little boy, my brother John\\n\\n\\\"Catherine Cavendish, I know what this means. 'Tis but another, device to part us. You love him not. You have hated him from the, first. You have hated him, and he is no more guilty than you be., 'Tis but a trick to turn me from him. Fie, think you that will avail?, Think you that a sister's heart counts with a maid before her, lover's? Little you know of love and lovers to think that.\\\"\\n\\nI sat there on that rock glittering like frost-work in the May, sunlight and watched the river current until it seemed to me that my, rock and all Virginia were going out on the tide to sea and back to, England, where, had I landed then, I would have lost my head and all, my wondering with it, and my old astonishment, which I had had from, a boy, was upon me, that so many things that be, according to the, apparent evidence of our senses are not, and how can any man ever be, sure that he is on sea or land, or coming or going? And comes there, not to all of us some day a great shock of knowledge of the slipping, past of this world, and all the history thereof which we think of so, much moment, and that we only are that which remains? But then, verily it seemed to me that the matter of the tobacco plot and Mary, Cavendish's danger was of more moment than aught else in the, century.\\n\\nI stood there, feeling like a deserter from the ranks, yet bound to, keep the door of Laurel Creek, and I had a pistol in either hand and, so had Sir Humphrey Hyde, but for a minute nobody seemed to heed us., Then as I stood there, I felt the door behind me yield a bit and a, hand was thrust out, and a voice whispered, \\\"Harry, Harry, come in, hither; we can hold the house against an army.\\\"\\n\\nThen indeed she caught my arm with a little nervous hand, like a, cramp of wire. \\\"You shall tell me, sir,\\\" she declared. \\\"This much I, know already. Yesterday the Golden Horn came in and was unladen of, powder and shot instead of the goods that my sister pretended to, order, and the cases are stored at Laurel Creek. This much do I, know, but not what is afoot, nor for what Mary had conference with, Sir Humphrey Hyde and Ralph last night, and you later on with Sir, Humphrey. I demand of you that you tell me, Harry Wingfield.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Answer me, Harry,\\\" said he. Then, when I would not, down came the, riding-whip, but only thrice, and not hard. \\\"Now go you home,\\\" said, my stepfather, \\\"and show your mother the hurt, however you came by, it, and have her put some of the cooling lotion on a linen cloth to, it.\\\" Then he and Captain Cavendish went their ways, and I went, toward home, creeping through the gap in the May hedge. But I did, not go far, having no mind to show my hurt, though I knew well that, my mother, being a woman and soft toward all wounds, would make much, of it, and maybe of me on its account. But I was not of a mind to, purchase affection by complaints of bodily ills, so I lay down under, the hedge in the soft grass, keeping my bruised shoulder uppermost\\n\\nthough she had tended her faithfully all the day before and half the, night, rubbing her with an effusion of herbs and oil for her, rheumatic pains. Yet for her, Madam Cavendish had no love, and, treated her with a stately toleration and no more. Mary understood, no cause for it, and often looked, as she did then, with a, distressful wonder at her grandmother when she seemed to hold her, sister so slightingly.\\n\\nand she never after made any opposition to our union. Then came, blustering up Parson Downs and Ralph Drake, who afterward wedded, Cicely Hyde, and the two Barrys who had braved leaving hiding, and, the two black wenches who dwelt with them, one with a great white, bandage swathing her head, and Sir Humphrey Hyde, who had just, been released, and who, while I think of it, wedded a most amiable, daughter of one of the burgesses within a year. And Madam Tabitha, Storey, with that mourning patch upon her forehead, was there\\n\\nWe sat there and waited, and the bell over in Jamestown rang and the, long notes died away with sweet echoes as if from distant heights., All around us the rank, woody growth was full of murmurs and, movements of life, and perfumes from unseen blossoms disturbed one's, thoughts with sweet insistence at every gust of wind, and always one, heard the lapping of the sea-water through all its countless ways\\n\\n\\\"As well go to a branch of a locust-tree blown by the May wind with, honey for all seeking noses, as to Chichely,\\\" said Parson Downs., \\\"And as for the burgesses, they are afraid of their own necks, and, some of us there be would rather have thee sit in stocks than lose, thy life, for we hold thy life dear, Harry, and some punishment it, must be for thee, for thou didst shoot a King's officer, though with, a damned poor aim, Harry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What know you of what my sister hath done and the cargo that came, yesterday on the Golden Horn?\\\" she demanded with no preface and of a, sudden; her voice rang sharp as I remembered it when she first spoke, to me by that white hedge of England, and I could have sworn that, the tide had verily borne us thither, and she was again that sallow, girl and I the blundering lout of a lad.\\n\\nI took high honours at Cambridge, though no higher than I should, have done, and so no pride and no modesty in the owning and telling;, and then I came home, and my mother greeted me something more warmly, than she was wont, and my stepfather, Col. John Chelmsford, took me, by the hand, and my brother John played me at cards that night, and, won, as he mostly did. John was at that time also in Cambridge, but, only in his second year, being, although of quicker grasp upon, circumstances to his own gain than I, yet not so alert at book-lore;, but he had grown a handsome man, as fair as a woman, yet bold as any, cavalier that ever drew sword--the kind to win a woman by his, own strength and her own arts.\\n\\n\\\"Harry, Harry,\\\" she said, \\\"I pray thee, come here.\\\" Then, when I, approached, hesitating, for I had a shrinking before some outburst, of feminine earnestness, which has always intimidated me by its fire, of helplessness and futility playing against some resolve of mine, which I could not, on account of my masculine understanding of the, requirements of circumstances, allow to melt, she reached up one, hand like a little nervous claw of ivory, and caught me by the, sleeve and pulled me down to a stool by her side. Then she looked at, me, and such love and even adoration were in her face as I never saw, surpassed in it, even when she regarded her granddaughter Mary, yet, withal a cruel distress and self-upbraiding and wrath at herself and, me. \\\"Harry, Harry,\\\" she said, \\\"I can bear no more of this.\\\" Then, to, my consternation, up went her silken apron with a fling to her old, face, and she was weeping under it as unrestrainedly as any child.\\n\\n\\\"and I will have you to understand it. He is a gentleman as well as, yourself, and you owe him an apology.\\\" So saying, she stamped her, foot and looked at Ralph Drake, her eyes flashing in the moonlight., But Ralph Drake, whose face I could see was flushed, even in that, whiteness of light, flung away with an oath muttered under his, breath, and struck out across the lawn, his black shadow stalking, before him.\\n\\nShe was as slender as a reed in this marshy country of Virginia, and, her voice was a sweet whisper, like the voice of one in a wind, and, she had a curious gracefulness of leaning toward one she loved when, in his presence, as if, whether she would or no, her heart of, affection swayed her body toward him. Always, in thinking of my, mother, I see her leaning with that true line of love toward my, stepfather or my brother John, her fair hair drooping over her, delicate cheeks, her blue eyes wistful with the longing to give more, and more for their happiness. My brother John looked like my mother\\n\\nThen, to my dismay, she turned to Mary and inquired what were the, goods which she had ordered from England, and to my greater dismay, the maid, with such a light of daring and mischief in her blue eyes, as I never saw, rattled off, the while Catherine and I stared aghast, at her, such a list of women's folderols as I never heard, and most, of them quite beyond my masculine comprehension.\\n\\nWhen at last we set forth, some of us riding, and some on foot, with, that old pirate captain to the front hunched to his saddle, for he, never could sit a horse like a landsman, but clung to him as if he, were a swaying mast, and worked his bridle like a wheel with the, result of heavy lunges to right or left, I felt for the first time, since I had come to Virginia like my old self.\\n\\nSo I left them, Mistress Catherine at the flax-wheel, and Mary out, in the garden with Sir Humphrey, gathering roses for the potpourri, jars, and the distilling into rosewater, for little idleness was, permitted at Drake Hill even after a ball. I got my horse, but as I, started forth Madam Cavendish called--a stiffly resolute old, figure standing in the great doorway, and I dismounted and went to, her, leading my horse, which I had great ado to keep from nibbling, the blossoms of a rose tree which grew over the porch. \\\"Harry,\\\" she, said in a whisper, \\\"where is Mary?\\\"\\n\\nwith the creek, the place its name. Sir Humphrey was coming from the, direction of the house, riding slowly, stooping in the saddle as if, with thought, and I guessed that he had been to see to the safety of, the contraband goods. When he saw me he halted and shouted, in his, hearty, boyish way, \\\"Halloo, halloo, Harry, and what luck?\\\" as if, all there was of moment in the whole world, and Virginia in, particular, was the shooting of birds on a May morning. But then his, face clouded, and he spoke earnestly enough. \\\"Harry, Harry,\\\" he, said, in a whisper, though there was no life nearer than the bees\\n\\nShe stood looking at her sister and me as we rode toward her, and, the sun was full on her face, which had the cool glimmer of a pearl, in the golden light, and her wide-open eyes never wavered. As she, stood there she might have been the portrait of herself, such a look, had she of unchanging quiet, and the wonder and incredulity which, always seized me at the sight of her to reconcile what I knew with, what she seemed, was strong upon me.\\n\\nand we bought a small portion of land and planted tobacco, and set, out trees. Then came the terror of the Indians, and Governor, Berkeley, always in wait for the word of the king, and doing, nothing, and once was our house burned, and we escaped barely with, our lives, and then came Nat Bacon, and blessings upon him, for he, made the beginning of a good work. And then did the soldiers riding, to meet him, so trample down our tobacco fields with horse hoofs\\n\\n, Thus we rode homeward, and presently came in sight of the Cavendish, tobacco-fields overlapped with the fresh green of young leaves like, the bosses of a shield, and on the right waved rosy garlands of the, locust grove, and such a wonderful strong sweetness of honey came, from it that we seemed to breast it like a wave, and caught our, breaths, and there was a mighty hum of bees like a hundred, spinning-wheels. But Mistress Mary and I regarded mostly that green, stretch of tobacco, and each of us had our thoughts, and presently, out came hers--\\\"Master Wingfield, I pray you, whose tobacco may, that be?\\\" she inquired in a sudden, fierce fashion.\\n\\n\\\"Even that will I dare for thee, Dick, for thee and that fair little, maid who is dabbling her pretty fingers in that flaming pudding with, which only the tough ones of a man should meddle,\\\" said Captain, Tabor. \\\"And as for risk for me, my sailormen be as much in the toils, for Sabbath-breaking as their captain, should yesterday's work leak, out; and not a man of them knoweth the contents of those cases\\n\\nAnd gladder still I was when astride my horse in the open, with the, sweet broadside of the spring wind in my face, and all the white, flowering trees and bushes bowing and singing with a thousand, bird-voices, like another congregation before the Lord. I had not, the honour to assist Mistress Mary to her saddle. Sir Humphrey Hyde, and Ralph Drake, who was a far-off cousin of hers; and my Lord, Estes, who was on a visit to his kinsman, Lord Culpeper, the, Governor of Virginia; and half a score of others pressed before me\\n\\n, I have always observed with wonder and amusement and a tender, gladness the faculty with which young creatures, and particularly, young girls, can throw off their minds for the time being the weight, of cares and anxieties and bring all of themselves to bear upon, those exercises of body or mind, to no particular end of serious, gain, which we call play and frivolity. It may be that faculty is so, ordained by a wise Providence, which so keeps youth and the bloom of, it upon the earth, and makes the spring and new enterprises, possible. It may be that without it we should rust and stick fast in, our ancient rivets and bolts of use.\\n\\n\\\"But think of something. I pray thee, think of something, Harry.\\\" He, looked at me with such exceeding wistfulness that I was forced to, cudgel my brains for something which, having a slight savour of, truth, might be seasoned to pungency at fancy. \\\"Often have I heard, her say that she liked a fair man,\\\" I replied, and indeed I had, and, believed her to have said it because I was dark, and seemingly, inattentive to some new grace of hers as to the tying of her hair or, fastening of her kerchief.\\n\\nSo I shouted and waited and shouted again, and no one came. There, was in my cell not much beside my pallet, except a little stand, which looked like one from Drake Hill, and on the stand was a china, dish like one which I had often seen at Drake Hill, with some mess, therein, what, I knew not, and a bottle of wine and some medicine, vials and glasses. I was not ironed, and, indeed, there was no need, of that, since I could not have moved.\\n\\nlike an army of locusts, and finally they begun to wax impatient., And finally up rose that termagant, Mistress Longman, straightening, her back with a spring as if it were whalebone, showing us her face, shameless with rage, and stained green with tobacco juice, and here, and there red with blood, for she had slashed ruthlessly. She flung, back her coarse tangle of hair, threw up her arms with a wild, hurrahing motion, and screamed out in such a volume of shrillness, that she overcapped all the rest of the tumult:\\n\\nthough more than seventy, sitting a horse as well as her, granddaughters, and looking, when viewed from the back, as young as, they, and being in that respect, as well as others, a wonder to the, countryside. But it happened to-day that Madam Cavendish had a touch, of the rheumatics, that being an ailment to which the swampy estate, of the country rendered those of advanced years somewhat liable, and, had remained at home on her plantation of Drake Hill (so named in, honour of the great Sir Francis Drake, though he was long past the, value of all such earthly honours). Catherine, who was a most, devoted granddaughter, had remained with her--although, I, suspected, with some hesitation at allowing her young sister to go, alone, except for me, the slaves being accounted no more company, than our shadows. Mistress Catherine Cavendish had looked at me, after a fashion which I was at no loss to understand when I had, stood aside to allow Mistress Mary to precede me in passing the, door, but she had no cause for the look, nor for the apprehension, which gave rise to it. By reason of bearing always my burthen upon, my own back, I was even more mindful of it than others were who had, only the sight of it, whereas I had the sore weight and the evil, aspect in my inmost soul. But it was to be borne easily enough by, virtue of that natural resolution of a man which can make but a, featherweight of the sorest ills if it be but put in the balance, against them. I was tutor to Mistress Mary Cavendish, and I had, sailed from England to Virginia under circumstances of disgrace;, being, indeed, a convict.\\n\\nAs he spoke Ralph Drake shouted out with a great laugh, that maybe, 'twas for the purpose of carrying the men, and pointed, and there, was one of the black wenches bringing Nick Barry, who else had, fallen, upon her back to the field. Then she set him down in the, tobacco and gave him a knife, and he went to cutting, having just, enough wit to do that for which his mind had been headed, and naught, else.\\n\\nThere were in her no change and shifting to new lights of beauty or, otherwise at the estimation of those around her; she rather, controlled, as it were, all the domestic winds. Captain Cavendish, bowed before his superior on his own deck, though I believe there, was much love betwixt them, and, as for the little maid, she, tempered the wilfulness which was then growing with her growth by, outward meekness at least. I used to think her somewhat afraid of, her grandmother, and disposed to cling for protection and, mother-love to her elder sister Catherine. Catherine, in those two, years, had blossomed out her beauty; her sallowness and green pallor, had become bloom, though not rosy, rather an ineffable clear white, like a lily. Her eyes, at once shy and antagonistic, had become as, steady as stars in their estimation of self and others, and all her, slender height was as well in her power of graceful guidance as the, height of a young oak tree. Catherine, in those days, paid very, little heed to me, for her one year of superior age seemed then, threefold to both of us, except as she was jealously watchful that I, win not too much of the love of her little sister. I have never seen, such love from elder to younger as there was from Catherine, Cavendish to her half-sister Mary after the little one had lost her, mother. And all that the little maid did, whether of work or play\\n\\nthat she had, under presence of ordering feminine finery from, England, spent all her year's income from her crops on powder and, shot for the purpose of making a stand in the contemplated, destruction of the new tobacco crops, and thereby plunged herself, and her family in a danger which were hard to estimate were it, discovered, I heard a shrill duet of girlish laughs and merry, tongues before the house. Then, on looking forth, whom should I see, but Mary Cavendish and Cicely Hyde, her great gossip, and a young, coloured wench, all washing their faces in the May dew, which lay in, a great flood as of diamonds and pearls over everything. I minded, well the superstition, older than I, that, if a maid washed her face, in the first May dew, it would make her skin wondrous fair, and I, laughed to myself as I peeped around the shutter to think that Mary, Cavendish should think that she stood in need of such amendment of, nature. Down she knelt, dragging the hem of her chintz gown, which, was as gay with a maze of printed posies as any garden bed, and she, thrust her hollowed hands into the dew-laden green and brought them, over her face and rubbed till sure there was never anything like it, for sweet, glowing rosiness. And Cicely Hyde, who must have come, full early to Drake Hill for that purpose, did likewise, and with, more need, as I thought, for she was a brown maid, not so fair of, feature as some, though she had a merry heart, which gave to her, such a zest of life and welcome of friends as made her a favourite., Up she scooped the dew and bathed her face, turning ever and anon to, Mary Cavendish with anxious inquiries, ending in trills of laughter, which would not be gainsaid in May-time and youth-time by aught of, so little moment as a brown skin. \\\"How look I now?\\\" she would cry, out. \\\"How look I now, sweetheart? Saw you ever a lily as fair as my, face?\\\" Then Mary, with her own face dripping with dew, with that, wonderful wet freshness of bloom upon it, would eye her with, seriousness as to any improvement, and bid her turn this way and, that. Then she would give it as her opinion that she had best, persevere, and laugh somewhat doubtfully at first, then in a full, peal when Cicely, nothing daunted by such discouragement in her, friend's eyes, went bravely to work again, all her slender body, shaking with mirth. But the most curious sight of all, and that, which occasioned the two maids the most merriment, though of a, covert and even tender and pitying sort, was Mary's black, serving-wench Sukey, a half-grown girl, who had been bidden to, attend her mistress upon this morning frolic. She was seated at a, distance, square in the wet greenness, and was plunging both hands, into the May dew and scrubbing her face with a fierce zeal, as if, her heart was in that pretty folly, as no doubt it was. And ever and, anon as she rubbed her cheeks, which shone the blacker and glossier, for it, she would turn the palms of her hands, which be so curiously, pale on a negro's hands, to see if perchance some of the darkness, had stirred. And when she saw not, then would she fall to scrubbing, again.\\n\\nBut in a trice it all changed, for the temper of a mob is as subject, to unexplained changes as the wind, and it was a great shout of, sympathy and triumph instead of derision. Then they tore off the, oak-sprigs with which they had bedecked themselves in honour of the, day, and by so doing showed disloyalty to the King, and the militia, making no resistance, and indeed, I have always suspected, secretly, rejoicing at it, they had me released in a twinkling, and foremost, among those who wrenched open the stocks was Capt. Calvin Tabor., Then Mary Cavendish and I stood together there before them all.\\n\\n\\\"My Lord Ealing is dead,\\\" she said, \\\"and thou knowest that he was a, kinsman of the Chelmsfords, and after his funeral came this ring and, a letter, and--and--thou art cleared, Harry. And--and--now I know, why thou didst what thou did, Harry, 'twas--'twas--to shield me.\\\", With that she burst into a great flood of tears, even throwing, herself upon the floor of my cell in all her slim length, and not, letting my brother John raise her, though he strove to do so.\\n\\nas was well known, gone mad with zeal in the cause of Nathaniel, Bacon, and had furnished him with money, and would herself have, fought for him had she been allowed. But Bacon, though no doubt with, gratitude for her help, had, as I believe is the usual case with, brave men, when set about with adoring women, but little liking for, her. It was, in faith, a curious sight she presented as she entered, that hall of Barry Upper Branch with the men rising and bowing low\\n\\nAs I stood watching her, I felt a touch on my arm, and looked, and, there stood Mistress Cicely Hyde, and her brown face was so puckered, with wrath and jealousy that I scarcely knew her. \\\"Did not Mary's, grandmother send you to escort her home, Master Wingfield?\\\" said she, in a sharp whisper, and I stared at her in amazement. \\\"When the ball, is over, Mistress Hyde,\\\" I said.\\n\\nThen I, being somewhat restored by the brandy, mustered up strength, enough to have a mind and speak it, and declared that I would not in, any case avail myself of his aid to escape, since I should only, bring trouble upon him who aided me, and should in the end be, caught. And just as I spoke came a company of soldiers to escort me, to the stocks, and the chance, for what it was worth, was over.\\n\\nbut a good cause makes not always worthy adherents.\\\" This last she, said with a toss of her head and a proud glance, for Nathaniel Bacon, was to this maid a hero of heroes, and naught but her sex and her, tender years, she being but twelve or so at the time, had kept her, from joining his ranks. But, indeed, in this I had full sympathy, with her, though chary of expressing it. Had it not been for my, state of disgrace and my outlook for the welfare of the Cavendishes\\n\\nand found fast, and Sir Humphrey was with me. Then came a hush for a, moment whilst the magistrate with Captain Waller, and others sitting, on their horses around him, read the Riot Act, and bade us all, disperse and repair to our homes, and verily I wonder, if ever there, hath been in all the history of England such a farce and mummery as, that same Riot Act, and if ever it were read with much effect when a, riot were well under way.\\n\\nbeing, in fact, almost feminine in his appearance, though not in his, character. He had the same fair face, perhaps more clearly and less, softly cut, and the same long, silky wave of fair hair, but the, expression of his eyes was different, and in character he was, different. As for me, I was like my poor father, so like that, as I, grew older, I seemed his very double, as my old nurse used to tell, me. Perhaps that may have accounted for the quick glance, which, seemed almost of fear, which my mother used to give me sometimes, when I entered a room where she sat at her embroidery-work. My, mother dearly loved fine embroideries and laces, and in thinking of, her I can no more separate her from them than I can a flower from, its scalloped setting of petals.\\n\\nWhen about half-way to Drake Hill I heard afar off a great din of, bells and horns and voices, which presently came nearer. Then the, road was filled up with the dancing May revellers, and verily I, wondered not so much at those decrees against such practices before, the Restoration, for it was as if the savages which they do say are, underneath the outer gloss of the best of us had broke loose, and I, wondered if it might not be like those mad and unlawful orgies which, it was said the god Pan led himself in person through Thessalian, groves. Those honest country maids, who in the morning had advanced, with rustic but innocent freedom, with their glossy heads crowned, with flowers, and those lusty youths, who were indeed something, boisterous, yet still held in a tight rein by decency, had seemingly, changed their very natures, or rather, perhaps, had come to that, pass when their natures could be no longer concealed. Along the road, in the white moonlight they stamped as wantonly as any herd of kine;, youths and maids with arms about each other, and all with faces, flushed with ale-drinking, and the maids with tossing hair and, draggled coats, and all the fresh garlands withered or scattered., And the old graybeard who was Maid Marion was riotously drunk, and, borne aloft with mad and feeble gesturings on the shoulders of two, staggering young men, and after him came the aged morris dancers\\n\\n, I know not how Capt. Calvin Tabor managed his part to tranship those, goods without discovery, but he had a shrewd head, and no doubt the, captain of the Earl of Fairfax another, and by eight o'clock that, May day the Golden Horn lay at her wharf discharging her cargo right, lustily with such openness of zeal and shouts of encouragement and, groans of labour 'twas enough to acquaint all the colony. And, straightway to the great house they brought my Lady Culpeper's, fallals, and clamped them in the hall where we were all at supper., Mistress Mary sprang to her feet, and ran to them and bent over, them. \\\"What are these?\\\" she said, all in a quiver.\\n\\n, I know not if my Lord Culpeper had any inkling of what was about to, happen. Some were there who always considered him to be one who, feathered his own nest with as little risk as might be, regardless, of those over and under him, and one who saw when it behooved him to, do so, and was blind when it served his own ends, even with the, glare of a happening in his eyes. And many considered that he was in, England when it seemed for his own best good without regard to the, king or the colony, but that matters not, at this date. In truth his, was a ticklish position, between two fires. If he remained in, Virginia it was at great danger to himself, if he sided not with the, insurgents; and on the other hand there was the certainty of his, losing his governorship and his lands, and perhaps his head, if he, went to tobacco-cutting with the rest of us. He was without doubt, better off on the high sea, which is a sort of neutral place of, nature, beyond the reach for the time, of mobs or sceptres, unless, one falls in with a black flag. At all events, off sailed my Lord, Culpeper, leaving Sir Henry Chichely as Lieutenant-Governor, and, verily he might as well have left a weather-cock as that, well-intentioned but pliable gentleman. Give him but a head wind, over him and he would wax fierce to order, and well he served the, government in the Bacon uprising, but leave him to his own will and, back and forth he swung with great bluster but no stability. None of, the colony, least of all the militia, stood in awe of Sir Henry, Chichely, nor regarded him as more than a figure-head of authority, when my Lord Culpeper had set sail.\\n\\nTherefore, that April morning, though filled in my inmost heart with, love and gratitude toward God, as I had always been since I had seen, His handiwork in Mary Cavendish, which was my especial lesson of His, grace to meward, with sweetest rhymes of joy for all my pains, and, reasons for all my doubts; and though she sat beside me, so near, that the rich spread of her gown was over my knee, and the shining, of her beauty warm on my face, yet was I weary of the service and, eager to be out. As I said before, Parson Downs was not to my mind\\n\\nAt fourteen I was as ungainly a lad, with as helpless a sprawl of, legs and arms and as staring and shamefaced a surprise at my, suddenly realised height of growth, when jostled by a girl or a, younger lad, and utter discomfiture before an unexpected deepness of, tone when essaying a polite response to an inquiry of his elders, as, was ever seen in England. And I remember that I bore myself with a, wary outlook for affronts to my newly fledging dignity, and, concealed all that was stirring in me to new life, whether of, nobility or natural emotion, as if it were a dire shame, and, whenever I had it in my heart to be tender, was so brusque that I, seemed to have been provided by nature with an armour of roughness, like a hedgehog. But, perhaps, I had some small excuse for this\\n\\nknowing well enough that all this could not affect his custom, and, being one of the most toughly leather-dried little men whom I, have ever seen, and his face so hardened into its final lines of, experience, that it had no power of changing under new ones. And, behind him stood peering, some with wide eyes of terror, and some, with ready laughs at nothing, the few other roisters in the tavern, at that hour. 'Twas not the best time of day for the meeting of, those choice spirits for the discussion of the other spirits which, be raised, willy-nilly, from the grape and the grain, for the, enhancing of the joy of life, and defiance of its miseries; but the, Barrys and Captain Jaynes and the parson were nothing particular as, to the time of day.\\n\\nthough not in what mad fashion, and Sir Humphrey rode with me until, our roads parted. Much gaming was there that night after we left; we, leaving the Barrys and my Lord Estes and Drake and Captain Jaynes, and many others intent upon the dice, but Humphrey and I did not, linger, I having naught to stake, and he having promised his mother, not to play. \\\"Sometimes I wish that I had not so promised my, mother,\\\" he said, looking back at me over his great boyish shoulder, as he rode ahead, \\\"for sometimes I think 'tis part of the estate of, a man to put up stakes at cards, and to win or lose as beseems a, gentleman of Virginia and a cavalier. But, sure, Harry, a promise to, a man's mother is not to be broke lightly, and indeed she doth ask, me every night when I return late, and I shall see her face at the, window when I ride in sight of the great house; but faith, Harry, I, would love to win in something, if not in hearts, in a throw of the, dice. For sure I am a man grown, and have never had my own will in, aught that lies near my heart.\\\" With that he gave a great sigh, and, I striving to cheer him, and indeed loving the lad, replied that he, was but young, and there was still time ahead, and the will of one's, heart required often but a short corner of turning. But he was angry, again at me for that, and cried out I knew not for all I was loved in, return, the heart of a certain maid as well as he who was despised\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I replied, \\\"but if I escape through them, 'twill serve to, convict them, and--and--besides, lad, I cannot be moved for, the bleeding of my wounds, such a long way; and besides, it is at, the best arrest for me, since I have been seen by the whole posse, and have shot down Captain Waller. Whither could I fly, pray? Not, back to England. Me they will take in custody in any case, and they, will not shoot a wounded captive. My life is safe for the time, being. Humphrey--\\\" With that I beckoned him to lean over me\\n\\nand when the door fell with a mighty crash near me, it might have, been the fall of a rose leaf on velvet, and I had small heed of the, fierce faces which bent over me, yet the hands extended toward my, wounds were tender enough. And I saw as in a dream, Capt. Robert, Waller, with his arm tied up, and wondered dimly if we were both, dead, for I verily believed that I had killed him, and I heard him, say, and his voice sounded as if a sea rolled between us, \\\"'Tis the, convict tutor, Wingfield, who held the door, and unless I be much, mistaken, he hath his death-wound. Make a litter and lift him, gently, and five of you search the house for whatever other rebels, be hid herein.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was there ever one like her?\\\" repeated Mary Cavendish, and as she, spoke, up she sprang and ran to her sister and flung a fair arm, around her neck, and drew her head to her bosom, and leaned her, cheek against it, and then looked at me with a sidewise glance which, made my heart leap, for curious meanings, of which the innocent, thing had no reckoning, were in it.\\n\\n\\\"But I would have--I would have you!\\\" she cried out, with the, ardour of a girl, and down went her apron, and her face, like an, aged mask of tragedy, not discoloured by her tears, as would have, happened with the tender skin of a maid, confronted me. \\\"I would, have you the governor himself, Harry. I would have you--I would, have--\\\" Then she stopped and looked at me with a red showing, through the yellow whiteness of her cheeks. \\\"You know what I would, have, and I know what you would have, and all the rest of my old, life would I give could it be so, Harry,\\\" she said, and I saw that, she knew of my love for her granddaughter Mary. Then suddenly she, cried out, vehemently: \\\"Not one word have I said to you about it, since that dreadful time, Harry Wingfield, for shame and that pride, as to my name, which is a fetter on the tongue, hath kept me still\\n\\nthere was a broad blazon of light from all the windows often to the, revealing of strange sights within, the shutters were closed, and, only by the lines of gold at top and bottom would one have known the, house was lit at all. And whereas there were always to be seen, horses standing openly before the porch, this night one knew there, were any about only by the sound of their distant stamping. And yet, this was the night when all mystery of plotting was to be resolved, into the wind of action.\\n\\nbut Mary would not see him. And she said, furthermore, that her, grandmother did not know that I was to be set in the stocks, and, they dared not tell her, as she was grown so feeble since the, riot--at one time inveighing against me for my disloyalty, and, saying that I should never have Mary, though I was cleared of my, disgrace and no more a convict, and at another time weeping like a, child over her poor Harry, who had already suffered so much and was, now in prison.\\n\\nwho had come from Huntingdonshire. She was at that time well turned, of threescore, but a woman who was, as she had always been, a power, over those about her. She looked her age, too, except for her, figure, for her hair was snowy white, and the lines of her face, fixed beyond influence of further smiles or tears. My imagination, has always been a mighty factor in my estimation of the characters, of others, and I have often wondered how true to facts I might be\\n\\nI laughed, for the danger from Indians was long since past, but said, readily enough that I would do as she wished, being, in fact, glad, enough of a gallop in the moonlight, with the prospect of meeting, Mary. So in a few minutes I was in the saddle and riding toward, Jamestown. The night was very bright with the moon, and there was a, great mist rising from the marshy lands, and such strangely pale and, luminous developments in the distances of the meadows, marshalling, and advancing and retreating, like companies of spectres, and, lingering as if for consultation on the borders of the woods, with, floating draperies caught in the boughs thereof, that one might have, considered danger from others than Indians. And, indeed, I often, caught the note of an owl, and once one flitted past my face and my, horse shied at the evil bird, which is thought by the ignorant to be, but a feathered cat and of ill omen, and indeed is considered by, many who are wise to have presaged ill oftentimes, as in the cases, of the deaths of the emperors Valentinian and Commodus. Be that as, it may, I, having a pistol with me, shot at the bird, and, though I, was as good a shot as any thereabouts, missed, and away it flew\\n\\nand not so much as I would fain have done of her sister. I was past, the boyish liberty of lying in wait in the park for a glimpse of, her; she was not of an age for me to pay my court, and there was, little intimacy betwixt my mother and Madam Cavendish. But I can, truly say that never for one minute did I lose the consciousness of, her in the world with me, and that at a time when my love might well, be a somewhat anomalous and sexless thing, since she was grown a, little past my first conception of love toward her, and had not yet, reached my second.\\n\\n\\\"Lord Culpeper is the representative of his Majesty here in, Virginia,\\\" said Madam Cavendish, with a high head, \\\"and no, granddaughter of mine absents herself with my approval. To the ball, you go, madam, and in that sky-coloured gown, and no more words., Things have come to a pretty pass.\\\" So saying, she rose and, leaning, heavily on her stick, with her black maid propping her, she went, out. Then turned Mistress Mary imperiously to us and demanded to, know the meaning of it all. \\\"Whence came these goods?\\\" said she to, Catherine.\\n\\nSir Humphrey stammered and looked at me, and looked away again. Then, suddenly spake Mistress Mary from her window overhead, set in a, climbing trumpet-vine, and so loudly and recklessly that had not her, grandmother and sister been on the farther side of the house they, must have heard her. \\\"'Tis not Sir Humphrey included the maid in the, plot, but the maid who included Sir Humphrey,\\\" said she. Then she, laughed, and at the same moment a mock-bird trilled in a tree.\\n\\nor soaking through homespun sleeve or waistcoat, that was like the, waving of a battle-flag or the call of a trumpet. Such a fury awoke, in us who looked on, as never was, and the prisoners had been then, and there torn from their horses and set free, had it not been for, the consideration that undue precipitation might ruin the main, cause. But the sight of human blood shed in a righteous cause is the, spur of the brave, and goads him to action beyond all else. Quite, silent we kept when that troop rode past us on their way to prison\\n\\nIt was but a small body of horse and foot, which charged us whilst, we were cutting the tobacco on the plantation of Laurel Creek, but, it needed not a large one to put to rout a company so overbalanced, by enthusiasm, and cider, and that marvellous greed of destruction., No more than seven gentlemen of us there were to make a stand, and, not more than some twenty-five of the rabble to be depended upon.\\n\\nAll this Catherine Cavendish told me in a manner which seemed, strangely foreign to her, being gentle, and yet not so gentle as, subdued, and her fair face was paler than ever, and when I looked at, her and said not a word, and yet had a question in my eyes which she, was at no loss to interpret, tears welled into her own, and she bent, lower and whispered lest even the stranger at the window should, hear, that Mary \\\"sent her dear love, but, but--\\\"\\n\\nwhich be not worth repeating. I being in such a position in the, colony, and considering the fact that Madam Cavendish and Catherine, were staunch loyalists, and would have sent all their tobacco to the, bottom of the salt sea had the king so ordained, and regarded all, disaffection from the royal will as a deadly sin against God and the, Church, as well as the throne, and knowing the danger which Mary, Cavendish ran, I was in a sore quandary. Could I have but gone to, those men whom I conceived to be in the plot, and talked with them, on an equal footing, I would have given my right hand. But I, wondered, and with reason, what hearing they would accord me, and I, wondered how to move in the matter at all without doing harm to, Mistress Mary, yet feared greatly that the non-movement would harm, her more. As I sat there I fell to marvelling anew, as I had, marvelled many times before, at that yielding on the part of the, strong which makes the power of those in authority possible. At the, yielding of the weak we marvel not, but when one sees the bending of, staunch, true men, with muscles of iron and hearts of oak, to, commands which be manifestly against their own best interests, it is, verily beyond understanding, and only to be explained by the working, of those hidden springs of nature which have been in men's hearts, since the creation, moving them along one common road of herding to, one common end. As I sat there I wondered not so much at the plot, which was simply to destroy all the young tobacco plants, that there, be not an over-supply and ruinous prices therefor next year, as at, the fact that the whole colony to a man did not arise and rebel, against the order of the king in that most infamous Navigation Act, which forbade exportation to any place but England, and load their, ships for the Netherlands, and get the full worth of their crops., Well I knew that some of the burgesses were secretly in favour of, this measure, and why should one man, Governor Culpeper, for the, king, hold for one minute the will of this strong majority in, abeyance?\\n\\nWhen we were once alone together I spurred my horse up to hers and, caught her bridle and rode alongside and spoke to her as if all the, past were naught, and I with the rights to which I had been born. It, had come to that pass with me in those days that all the pride I had, left was that of humility, but even that I was ready to give up for, her if necessary.\\n\\nthough it was an old one, as rich as Mary's, of her favourite green, with a rose pattern broidered on the front of it, and a twist of, green gauze in her fair hair, and that same necklace of green stones, which she had shown me in the morning around her long throat, and, her long, milky-white arms hanging at her sides in the green folds, of her gown, and that pale radiance of perfection in her every, feature that made many call her the pearl of Virginia, though, as I, have said before, she had no lovers. She and Mary were going to the, ball, and a company of black servants with them. As for me, balls, were out of the question for a convict tutor, and I knew it, and so, did they. But suddenly, to my great amazement, Madam Cavendish, turned to me: \\\"And wherefore are you not dressed for the ball\\n\\nthen the laughter would follow--enough, it seemed, to make the roof, shake--and all the time the hum of the bees in the honey-locust, outside went on. Verily at that time in Virginia, with all the, spirit of the people in a ferment of rebellion against the, established order of things, being that same ferment which the, ardour of Nathaniel Bacon had set in motion, and which, so far as, I see now, was the beginning of an epoch of history, there was, nothing after all, no plotting nor counterplotting, no fierce, inveighing against authority, nor reckless carousing on the brinks, of precipices, which could for a second stay the march of the, mightiest force of all--the spring which had returned in its, majesty of victory, for thousands of years, and love which had, come before that.\\n\\nand with never a word of nagging in my ears to make me pay penance, for the service. What a man with a good horse, and good wine, and, good tobacco, wanteth a wife for, passeth my understanding, but I, know thou art young, and the maid is a fair one. Faith, and she was, in such sore affliction this morning because of thee, Harry, as, might well console any man. Had she been Bacon's widow, she had not, wedded again, but gone widow to her death. Thou shouldst have seen, her, lad, when I ventured to strive to comfort her with the, reflection that her suffering in thy behalf was not so grievous as, was Bacon's wife's for his death, for thou art to have thy life, my, poor Harry, and no great hurt, though it may be somewhat wearisome, if the sun be hot. But Mistress Mary Cavendish flew out at me in, such wise, though she hath known all along to what fate thou wert, probably destined, and said such harsh things of poor Madam Bacon\\n\\nI was up and dressed in a trice, and sword in hand, and out of my, window, which was on the first floor, and there was Mistress Mary, and Sir Humphrey Hyde. I stepped between them and thrust aside Sir, Humphrey, who would have opposed me. \\\"Go into the house, madam,\\\", said I to her, and pointed to the door, which stood open. Then while, she hesitated, half shrinking before me, with her old habit of, obedience strong upon her, yet with angry wilfulness urging her to, rebellion, forth stepped her distant cousin Ralph Drake from behind, a white-flowering thicket, and demanded to know what that cursed, convict fellow did there, and had he not a right to parley with his, cousin, and was her honour not safe with her kinsman and he an, English gentleman? I perceived by Ralph Drake's voice that he had, perchance been making gay with the revellers at Jamestown, and stood, still when he came bullyingly toward me, but at that minute Mistress, Mary spoke.\\n\\nHe laughed, and I stared at him that he should stoop to jest, yet, having a ready leap of comradeship toward him for it; then suddenly, his mood changed. Close to me he edged, and began talking with a, serious shrewdness which showed his mind brought fully to bear upon, the situation. \\\"You say, sir,\\\" said he, \\\"that Mistress Mary, Cavendish, in a spirit of youthful daring and levity, gave her, grandmother a list of the goods which my Lady Culpeper ordered from, England, and which even now is due?\\\" I nodded.\\n\\nand I would have not had it so could I have helped it, and, I pray, you, have a care to her safety.\\\" This he spoke so low that Mary, could not hear, and, moreover, she, with one of those sudden turns, of hers that made her have as many faces of delight as a diamond in, the sun, had thrown an arm around the neck of Sir Humphrey's mare\\n\\n\\\"Here is Catherine, grandmother,\\\" said she, \\\"and she has had a, narrow escape from being pressed as Maid Marion by the morris, dancers.\\\" Madam Cavendish made a slight motion, and looked not at, Catherine, but turned to me with that face of anxious kindness which, she wore for me alone. \\\"Saw you aught of the Golden Horn this, morning, Master Wingfield?\\\" asked she, and I replied truthfully, enough that I had not.\\n\\nthough it was not customary for a criminal to be attended to the, stocks by a clergyman, but only to the scaffold. But, as I began, to gather some strength through that fiery draught which I had, swallowed, and the fresh air, it verily seemed to me, though I had, done with any vain complaints and was of a mind to bear my ignominy, with as much bravery as though it were death, that it was as much of, an occasion for spiritual consolation. I could not believe--when, we were arrived at the New Field, and I was assisted from my chair, in the midst of that hooting and jeering throng, which even the, soldiers and the threatening gestures of the parson and my brother, served but little to restrain--that I was myself, and still more, so, when I was at last seated in that shameful instrument, the, stocks.\\n\\n\\\"That, that--oh, confound it, Harry, there is no harm in saying, it, for you as well as I know the folly of it, and that 'tis but the, jealous fancy of a girl. Faith, but I think my sister Cicely is as, much in love with Mary Cavendish as I. 'Tis but--my sister, Cicely, when she will tease me, tells me 'tis not I but you that, Mary Cavendish hath set her heart upon, Harry.\\\"\\n\\nWe had been at work some little time when a tall woman in black on a, black horse came up at a steady amble, her horse being old. She, dismounted near me and her horse went to nibbling the low-hanging, boughs of a locust nearby, and the moon shone full on her face, and, I saw she was the Widow Tabitha Story, with that curious patch on, her forehead. Down to the tobacco she bent and went to work stiffly, with unaccustomed hands to such work, and then again rang that cry, of \\\"Remember Nathaniel Bacon!\\\" And when she heard that, up she, reared herself, and raised such a shrill response of \\\"Remember, Nathaniel Bacon!\\\" in a high-sobbing voice, as I never heard.\\n\\nBut I begged him to say no more, and started toward the window, the, door being fast locked as Mistress Mary had left it, when suddenly, the boy stopped me and caught me by the hand, and begged me to tell, him if I thought there might be any hope for him with Mary, Cavendish, being moved to do so by her sending him away so, peremptorily the night before, which had put him in sore doubt., \\\"Tell me, Harry,\\\" he pleaded, and the great lad seemed like a child\\n\\n\\\"Amen,\\\" I said, and felt as I said it, that if indeed that hero were, alive, this plot for the destroying of the young tobacco plants, might be the earthquake which threw off a new empire; but as it, were, remembering the men concerned, who had none of the stuff of, Bacon in them, I wondered if it would prove aught more than a wedge, in the scheme of liberty.\\n\\nAs I said before, it was a hot day, and all around the field waved, fruit boughs nearly past their bloom, with the green of new, leaves overcoming the white and red, and the air was heavy with, honey-sweet, and, as steady as a clock-tick through all the roaring, of the merrymakers, came the hum of the bees and the calls of the, birds. A great flag was streaming thirty feet high, and the gay, dresses of the women who had congregated to see the sports were like, a flower-garden, and the waistcoats of the men were as brilliant as, the breasts of birds, and nearly everybody wore the green oak-sprig, which celebrated the Restoration.\\n\\nthough she was well used to it, burst into a storm of tears, and, sprang to her feet, and cried out in a wild voice like a furious, cat's: \\\"Up with ye, I say! And why do ye stop and parley? And why do, ye wait for my Lord Culpeper to sail? I trow the women be not, afraid of the governor, if the men be! Up with ye, and this very, night cut down the young tobacco-plants, and cheat the king of, England, who reigns but to rob his subjects. Who cares for the, Governor of Virginia? Who cares for the king? Up with ye, I say!\\\", With that she snatched a sword from a peg on the wall and swung it, in a circle of flame around her head, and what with her glowing eyes, and streaming black locks, and burning beauty of cheeks, and, cat-like shriek of voice, she was enough to have made the governor\\n\\neven that which may harm it, and thou knowest not the heart of a, woman if thou dost love one, sir,\\\" said she. Then she gave a quick, glance at my face, so close to hers in the midst of that hurrying, throng, and her blue eyes gleamed into mine, and she said, with a, bright blush over her cheeks and forehead and neck, but proudly as, if she defied even her maiden shame in the cause of love, \\\"But thou, shalt yet know one, Harry.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then I looked at her, and would have besought her to go, but the, words died on my lips, for in that minute I knew what love was, and, how it could triumph over, not only the tragedy, but that which is, more cruel, the comedy of life. Surely no face of woman was ever, like Mary Cavendish's, as she sat there beside me, with such an, exaltation of love, which made it like the face of an angel. Not one, word she said, but looked at me, and I knew that after that she was, mine forever, in spite of my love, which would fain shield her from, me lest I be for her harm, and I realised that love, when it is at, its best, is past the consideration of any harm, being sufficient, unto itself for its own bliss and glory.\\n\\nAll the time we talked, we advanced in our slashing swath up the, field, and all the time that chorus of wild laughter and shrieks of, disloyalty kept time with the swash of the knives, and all the time, rose Captain Jaynes' storm of fruitless curses and commands, and now, and then the stinging lash of his riding whip, and also Dick, Barry's. As for Nick Barry, he lay overcome with sleep on a heap of, the cut tobacco.\\n\\nI held my pistols and watched his eyes, knowing well that all action, through having its source in the brain of man, gives first evidence, in the eyes. Then the time came when I saw his impulse to charge, start in his eyes, and I fired, and he fell. Then I fired again, but, wildly, for everything was in motion, and I know not whom I hit, if, any one, then I felt my own right leg sink under me and I knew that, I was hit. Then down on my knees I sank and put one arm through the, great latch of the door, and thrust out with my knife with the free, hand, and stout arms were at my shoulders striving to drag me away\\n\\n, When I came to a consciousness of myself again, the first thing of, which I laid hold with my mind as a means whereby to pull my, recollections back to my former cognisance of matters was a broad, shaft of sunlight streaming in through the west window of the prison, in Jamestown. And all this sunbeam was horribly barred like the body, of a wasp by the iron grating of the window, and had a fierce sting, of heat in it, for it was warm though only May, and I was in a high, fever by reason of my wounds. And another thing which served to hale, me back to acquaintance with my fixed estate of life was a great, swarm of flies which had entered at that same window, and were, grievously tormenting me, and I was too weak to disperse them. All, my wounds were dressed and bandaged and I was laid comfortably, enough upon a pallet, but I was all alone except for the flies which, settled upon me blackly with such an insistence of buzzing that that, minor grievance seemed verily the greatest in the world, and for the, time all else was forgot.\\n\\nCapt. Geoffry Cavendish was a gaunt man with the hectic colour of a, fever, which he had caught in the new country, still in the hollows, of his cheeks. He was quite young, with sudden alertnesses of, glances in bright black eyes like the new colours in jewels when the, light shifts. His daughter has the same, though her eyes are blue., Moreover, through having been in the royal navy before he got a, wound which incapacitated him from further service, and was indeed, in time the cause of his death, he had acquired a swift suppleness, of silent movement, which his daughter has inherited also.\\n\\nMistress Mary Cavendish had framed in black, in her chamber, a, silhouette of this hero, and she wore in a locket a lock of his, hair, by which she had come, in some girlish fashion, through a, young gossip of hers, a kinswoman of Bacon's, from whose head I, verily believe she had pilfered it while asleep. And, more than, that, I knew of her and Cicely Hyde strewing fresh blossoms on the, tide of the York River, in which Bacon had been buried, on the, anniversary of his death, and coming home with sweet eyes red with, tears of heroic sentiment, which surely be not the most ignoble shed, by mankind.\\n\\nMadam Judith Cavendish was a stern task-mistress, and especially for, these latter duties. Had it not been for the stress of favour in, which she held me, I question if my vocation as tutor to Mistress, Mary would have had much scope for the last year, since her, grandmother esteemed so highly the importance of a maid's being, versed in all domestic arts, such as the spinning and weaving of, flax and wool, and preserving and distilling and fine needlework., She set but small store by Latin and arithmetic for a maid, not even, if she were naturally quick at them, as was Mistress Mary; and had, it not been that she was bent upon keeping me in her service at, Drake Hill, I doubt not that she would have clapped together the, maid's books, whether or no, and set her to her wheel. As it was, a, goodly part of every day was passed by her in such wise, but so fond, was my pupil of her book that often I have seen her with it propped, open, for her reference, on a chair at her side.\\n\\nwhich should have all the silks and jewels of earth, and no, questioning, for its adorning, was not given to selfish, appropriation for her own needs, but rather considered those of, others first. However, Mistress Mary had some property in her own, right, she being the daughter of a second wife, who had died, possessed of a small plantation called Laurel Creek, which was a, mile distant from Drake Hill, farther inland, having no ship dock, and employing this. Mistress Mary might have sent some of her own, tobacco crop to England wherewith to purchase finery for herself., Still I wondered, and I wondered still more when Mistress Mary\\n\\nAnd she kept on jabbering with that slow murmur of sweetness, and I, stood looking down at her, catching my breath with the pain in my, shoulder, though it was out of my thoughts with this new love of, her, and then came my father, Col. John Chelmsford, and Capt., Geoffry Cavendish, walking through the park in deep converse, and, came upon us, and stopped and stared, as well they might.\\n\\nOne strange feature was there about this letter, which the writer, had not foreseen, while it cleared me well enough in the opinion of, the family, to strangers it cleared me not at all, for who was to, know for what reason I had entered Catherine's chamber, and took and, secreted that ring of his lordship's? Strict silence had I, maintained, and so had Madam Cavendish all these years, and naught, in that letter would clear me before any court of law. Catherine, being the only one whose innocence was made plain, I could now tell, my story with no fear of doing her harm, but let those believe my, part of it who would! Still I may say here, that I verily believe, that I was at last cleared in the minds of all who knew me well, and, for others I cared not. My term expired soon after that date, and, though I chose to remain in Virginia and not return to England, yet, my property was restored to me, for my half-brother, John, Chelmsford, when confronted by any gate of injustice leapt it like, an English gentleman, with no ado. And yet after I heard that, letter, I knew that I was a convict still, and knew that for some I, would be until the end of the chapter, and when I grew a little, stronger, that wild hope that now I might have Mary, dimmed within, me, for how could I allow her to wed a man with a stain upon his, honour? And even had I been pardoned, the fact of the pardon had, seemed to prove my guilt.\\n\\nWhen we had passed the negro huts, swarming with black babies, shining in the sun as sleek as mahogany, and all turning toward us, with a marvellous flashing of white eyeballs and opening of red, mouths of smiles, all at once, like some garden bed of black, flowers, at the sight of our gay advance, we reached the great, house, and Mistress Catherine stood in the door clad in a green, satin gown which caught the light with smooth shimmers like the, green sheath of a marsh lily.\\n\\nhow could I recite to her the true list of my rare finery which came, to port yesterday? So I but gave the list of goods for which my Lady, Culpeper sent to England for the replenishing of her wardrobe and, her daughter's, and which is daily expected by ship. I had it from, Cicely Hyde, who had it from Cate Culpeper. The ship is due now, and, may be even now in port, and so I worded what I said, that 'twas, not, after all, a fib, except the hearer chose to make it so. I, said, 'Such goods as these are due, madam.'\\\" Then she gave the list, anew, like a parrot, while Catherine, who had returned, stood, staring at her, white with terror, though Mary did not see her until, she had finished. Then, when she turned and caught her keenly, anxious eyes, she started. \\\"You here, Catherine?\\\" said she. Then\\n\\nNot a woman was there at Barry Upper Branch, except for slaves, and, such stories were told as might cause a modest maid to hesitate to, speak of the place; but Mary Cavendish was as yet but a child in her, understanding of certain things. Her blue eyes fixed me with the, brave indignation of a boy as she went on, \\\"'Tis a pretty parson,\\\", said she again, \\\"and it would be the tavern, just as openly, were it, on a week day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If but Nat Bacon were alive!\\\" he sighed. \\\"No leader have we, Harry., Oh, Harry, if thou wert not a convict! Captain Jaynes is sure out of, his element in defending the rights of the oppressed, and should be, on his own quarter-deck with his cutlass in hand and his, rapscallions around him, slaying and robbing, to be in full feather., Naught can he do here. Lord, hear those women shriek! Why did they, let women come hither, Harry? Sure Nick Barry is in his cups. Not, thus would matters have been were Bacon alive. The women would have, been at home in their beds, and no man in liquor at work, for I, trust not the militia. Would Captain Bacon were alive, as he would, have been, had he not been foully done to death.\\\"\\n\\nand the quaver of her blessings was yet in my ears, when verily I, did see that which I have never understood. As I live, there passed, from the house of that ne'er-do-well next door, which was closed, tightly as if to assure folk that all therein were sound asleep, a, bright light like a torch, but no man carried it, and it crossed the, road and was away over the meadows, and no man whom I saw carried, it, and it waved in the wind like a torch streaming back, and I knew, it for a corpse candle. And that same night the man who dwelt in, that house was slain while pulling up the tobacco plants.\\n\\nopen space, the sports began, and I saw them all as in a dream, or, worse than a dream, a nightmare. First came Parson Downs, whispering, to me that as long as he could do me no good, and was in sore need, of money, and, moreover, since he would by so doing divert somewhat, the public attention from me, he would enter the race which was, shortly to come off for a prize of five pounds.\\n\\nBe that as it may, I was going along in such fashion through the, greenness of the park, so deep with rich lights and shadows on it, that May morning that it seemed like plunging thought-high in a, green sea, when suddenly I stopped and my heart leapt, for there sat, in the grass before me, clutching some of it with a tiny hand like a, pink pearl, the sweetest little maid that ever this world held. All, in white she was, and of a stuff so thin that her baby curves of, innocence showed through it, and the little smock slipped low down, over her rosy shoulders, and her little toes curled pink in the, green of the grass, for she had no shoes on, having run away, before, she was dressed, by some oversight of her black nurse, and down from, her head, over all her tiny body, hiding all save the merest glimmer, of the loveliness of her face, fell the most wonderful shower of, gold locks that ever a baby of only two years old possessed. She sat, there with the sunlight glancing on her through a rift in the trees\\n\\nfor she always dearly loved such pretty things. And it went hard, with me that I had not the wherewithal to sometimes purchase a, comfit to thrust into her little hand, reaching of her nature for, sweets like the hands of all young things. Often I saw my brother, John win her notice in such wise, for he, though he cared in general, but little for small folk, was ravished by her, as indeed was every, one who saw her. And once my brother John gave her a ribbon stiff, with threads of gold which pleased her mightily at the time, though\\n\\nHe laughed in that mocking fashion of his which incensed me still, further. Then he spoke civilly enough, and said that he meant no, disrespect to one of the fairest ladies whom he had ever had the, good fortune to see, but that it was so well known as to be no more, slight in mentioning than the paint and powder wherewith a woman, enhanced her beauty, that a woman's tongue could not be trusted like, a man's, and that it were a pity that money, which were much better, spent by her for pretty follies, should be put to such grim uses\\n\\nI waited a moment. Sir Humphrey had been much about the place since, he was a mere lad, and had had, I believe, a sort of boyish, good-will toward me. Not much love had he for books, but I was, accounted a fair shot, and had some knowledge of sports of hunting, and fishing, and had given him some lessons, and he had followed me, about some few years before, somewhat to the uneasiness of his, mother, who could not forget that I was a convict.\\n\\nwhich puzzled me exceedingly, until matters were explained. Colonel, Chelmsford had parted with me when I left England with but scant, courtesy, and as for my poor mother, I had not seen her at all, she, being confined to her chamber with grief over my disgrace, and not, one word had I received from them since that time. So when John, Chelmsford said that our mother sent her dear love to her son Harry\\n\\nMy party was headed by Capt. Noel Jaynes, something to my, discontent, for the hardest luck of choosing in the world to my mind, is that of choosing a leader, for the leader is in himself a very, gall-stone. Never had it pleased me to follow any man's bidding, and, in one way only could I comfort myself and retain my respect of, self, and that was by the consideration that I followed by my own, will, and so in one sense led myself.\\n\\nBut when I speak of my possessing an imagination which could gild, all the common things of life, I meant not to include Mistress Mary, Cavendish therein, for she needed not such gilding, being one of the, most uncommon things in the earth, as uncommon as a great diamond, which is rumoured to have been seen by travellers in far India. My, imagination when directed toward her was exercised only with the, comparing and combining of various and especial beauties of, different times and circumstances, when she was attired this way or, that way, or was grave or gay, or sweetly helpless and clinging or, full of daring. When, riding near her, I did not look at her, she, seemed all of these in one, and I was conscious of such a great, dazzle forcing my averted eyes, that I seemed to be riding behind a, star.\\n\\nThen she let me go, and I went forth thinking that here was a, helpmeet for a soldier in such times as these, and how I gloried in, her because she held her love as one with glory. Round to the stable, for my horse I stole, and it was very dark, with a soft smother of, darkness because of a heavy mist, and the moon not up, and I had, backed my horse out of his stall and was about to mount him, before, I was aware of a dark figure lurking in shadow, and made out by the, long sweep of the garments that it was a woman. I paused, and looked, intently into the shadow, where she stood so silently that she might, have deceived me had it not been for a flutter of her cloak in a, stray wind.\\n\\nAs we followed on that moonlight night, she and I alone, of a sudden, I felt my youth and love arise to such an assailing of the joy of, life, that I knew myself dragged as it were by it, and had no more, choosing as to what I should not do. Verily it would be easier to, lead an army of malcontents than one's own self. And something there, was about the moonlight on that fair Virginian night, and the, heaviness of the honey-scents, and the pressure of love and life on, every side, in bush and vine and tree and nest, which seemed to, overbear me and sweep me along as on the crest of some green tide of, spring. Verily there are forces of this world which are beyond the, overcoming of mortal man so long as he is encumbered by his, mortality.\\n\\nMadam Cavendish nodded approvingly when she had done. \\\"'Tis a wise, choice,\\\" said she, \\\"and as soon as the ship comes in have the goods, brought here and unpacked that I may see them.\\\" With that she rose, stiffly, and, beckoning Catherine, who looked as if she could, scarcely stand herself, much less serve as prop for another, she, went out, tapping her stick heavily on one side, on the other, leaning on her granddaughter's shoulder.\\n\\nHer bare, slender arms were clasped before her, and her long, white, neck was bent into an arch of watchful grace. Her face was the, gravest I ever saw on maid, and not to be reconciled with my first, acquaintance with her, thereby giving me always a slight doubt as of, a mask, but her every feature was as clear and fine as ivory, and, her head proudly crowned with great wealth of hair. Catherine, Cavendish was esteemed a great beauty, by both men and women, which, shows, perchance, that her beauty availed her little in some ways\\n\\nand went to stroking his head; when straightway, my horse either not, liking his touch or the smell of his liquored breath, and judging as, was his wont that the fault must by some means lie with his own, race, straightway lashed out a vicious hind leg like a hammer, and, came within an ace of the parson's own valuable horse--not the, one which he proposed trading for mine--and the wind of the lash, frighted the parson's horse, and he in his turn lashed out, and, another horse at his side sprang aside; and straightway there was, such a commotion in the tavern yard as never was, and slaves and, white servants shouting, and forcing rearing horses to their regular, standing, and I stroking my beast, and striving as best I could to, bring his pure horse wits to comprehend the strong pressure and, responsibility of humanity for the situation; and the Barry brothers, and Captain Jaynes came running forth, Captain Jaynes swearing in, such wise that it was beyond the understanding of any man unversed, in that language of the high seas; and Nick Barry, laughing wildly\\n\\nbut all the madder of his wits for that, with an arm around the, waist of a buxom lass on either side, and all three dancing in time., Then all the rest echoed that shout of \\\"Down with the governor!\\\", Then out he burst again with, \\\"Down, down with the tobacco, down, with the tobacco!\\\" But the volley of that echo was cut short by five, horsemen galloping after the throng and scattering them to the right, and left. Then a great voice of authority, set out with the, strangest oaths which ever an imagination of evil compassed, called, out to them to be still if they valued their heads, and cursed them, all for drunken fools, and as he spoke he lashed with his whip from, side to side, and his face gleamed with wrath like a demon's in the, full light, and I saw he was Captain Noel Jaynes, and well, understood how he had made a name for himself on the high seas., After him rode the brothers, Nicholas and Richard Barry, two great, men, sticking to their saddles like rocks, with fair locks alike on, the head of each flung out on the wind, and then came Ralph Drake, rising in his stirrups and laughing wildly, and last Parson Downs\\n\\nI stood well back to let them pass, being in that mood of, self-importance, by reason of my love and the service rendered by, it, that I could have seen the whole posse led to the whipping-block, with a relish, when suddenly from their tipsy throats came a shout, of such import that my heart stood still. \\\"Down with the king!\\\", hallooed one mad reveller, in a voice of such thickness that the, whole sentence seemed one word; then the others took it up, until, verily it seemed to me that their heads were not worth a farthing., Then, \\\"Down with the governor! down with Lord Culpeper!\\\" shouted, that same thick voice of the man who was leading the wild crew like, a bell-wether. He forged ahead, something more steady on his legs\\n\\nin spite of her degradation of body and estate--went about with, a free swinging motion of hips, bearing a tray filled with pewter, mugs of strong spirits. Around this woman's neck glittered row on, row of beads, and she wore a great flame-coloured turban, and long, gold eardrops dangled to her shoulders against the glossy blackness, of her cheeks, and bracelets tinkled on her polished arms, which, were mighty shapely, though black. In faith, the wench, had she but, possessed roses and lilies for her painting, instead of that, duskiness as of the cheek of midnight, had been a beauty such as was, seldom seen. Her dark face was instinct with mirth and jollity, and\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the other woman, who was long and lean, and had wedded, late in life a man she would have scorned in her girlhood, and could, not forgive the wrong she had done herself, and was filled with an, inconsistency of spleen toward all younger and fairer than she, and, who, moreover, was a born toad-eater for all in high places, \\\"'tis, fine feathers make fine birds, and were thy Cate arrayed in that, same gown in Mistress Cavendish's stead--\\\"\\n\\nand I, with scarce my full growth, and he pleading for mercy at, the second round, with an eye like a blackberry and a nose like a, gillyflower, and--and--Harry, you might tell her of it, and say not, where you got the news, if you thought it no harm. And, Harry, you, will mind the time when I killed the wolf with naught but an oak, club for weapon, and she, maybe, hath not heard of that. And I, should have been to the front with Bacon, boy as I was, had it not, been for my mother--that you know well and could make her sure of., And, and--oh, confound it, Harry, little book wit have I in my head\\n\\nI tied my horse with the others, with a tight halter, for he was apt, to pick quarrels, having always a theory that such discomforts as, flies or a long weariness of standing were in some fashion to be, laid to the doors of other horses, and indeed made always of his own, kind his special scapegoat of the dispensation of Providence. 'Tis, little I know about that great mystery of the animal creation and, its relation toward the human race, but verily I believe that that, fine horse of mine, from his propensity for kicking and lashing out, from his iron-bound hoofs at whatever luckless steed came within his, reach whenever the world went not to his liking, could not see an, inch beyond the true horizon limit of the horse race, and attributed, all that happened on earth, including man, to the agency of his own, sort. Sure I was, from the backward glance of viciousness which he, cast at the other stamping steeds as soon as I dismounted, that he, concluded with no hesitation they had in some way led me to ride him, thither instead of to his snug berth in the Cavendish stables, with, his eager nose in his feed trough.\\n\\nand the old woman eyed her with pride, which she was fain to conceal, by chiding. \\\"You will ruin your complexion if you go out in such a, wind without your mask,\\\" she said, and looked at the maiden's roses, and lilies with that rapture of admiration occasioned half by memory, of her own charms which had faded, and half by understanding of the, value of them in coin of love, which one woman can waken only in, another.\\n\\nCatherine in that way, which none but a woman hath, since it, pertains both to love and authority, brought me to my senses, and I, grew both brave and shamed at the same time, and yet after she had, gone, never was anything like the sting of that ignominy which was, prepared for me on the morrow. Many a time had I seen men in the, stocks, and passed them by with no ridicule, for that, it seemed to, me, belonged to the same class of folk as the culprits, but with a, sort of contempt which held them as less than men and below pity, even. The thought that some day I, too, was to sit there, had never, entered my head. I looked at my two feet upholding the coverlid, and, pictured to myself how they would look protruding from the boards of, the stocks. I recalled the faces of all I had ever seen therein, and, wondered whether I would look like this or that one. I remembered, seeing them pelted by mischievous boys, and as the dusk thickened\\n\\nand caught her breath again and again with a sobbing sigh. All that, I could say to comfort her I said, assuring her, as was indeed the, truth, that no woman could justly estimate the view which a man, might take of such a condition as mine, and how the power of service, to love might be enough to content one, and he stand in no need of, pity, but she was not much consoled. \\\"Harry,\\\" she said, \\\"Harry, thou, art like a knight of olden times about whom a song was written\\n\\nindeed, being not only in my ordinary clothes, but somewhat splashed, with mire from my mad gallop through the woods. But I judged rightly, that in so much of a crowd I should pass unnoticed both as to myself, and my apparel. I stood in the great room near the door and watched, the dance, and 'twas as brilliant a scene as ever I had seen, anywhere even in England. The musicians in the gallery were sawing, away for their lives on violins, and working breathlessly at the, hautboys, and all that gay company of Virginia's best, spinning, about in a country dance of old England. Such a brave show of velvet, coats, and breeches, and flowered brocade waistcoats, and powdered, wigs, and feathers, and laces, and ribbons, and rich flaunts of, petticoats revealing in the whirl of the dance clocked hose on, slender ankles, and high-heeled satin shoes, would have done no, discredit to the court. But of them all, Mistress Mary Cavendish was, the belle and the star. She was dancing with my Lord Estes when I, entered, and such a goodly couple they were, that I heard many an, exclamation of delight from the spectators, who stood thickly about, the walls, the windows even being filled with faces of black and, white servants. My Lord Estes was a handsome dark man, handsomer and, older than Sir Humphrey Hyde, who, though dancing with the, governor's daughter Cate, had, I could see, a rueful eye of, watchfulness toward Mary Cavendish. As he and Cate Culpeper swung, past me, Sir Humphrey's eyes fell on my face and he gave a start and, blush, and presently, when the dance was over and his partner, seated, came up to me with hand extended, as if I had been the, noblest guest there. \\\"Harry, Harry,\\\" he whispered eagerly, \\\"she hath, danced with me three times to-night, and hath promised again, and, Harry, saw you ever any one so beautiful as she in that blue dress?\\\"\\n\\nanswered evasively somewhat about hunting and Sir Humphrey. Some, reply of that tenor was necessary, as I was, beside my knife for the, tobacco cutting, armed to the teeth and booted to my middle. But, there was no deceiving Mary Cavendish. She seized both my hands, and, I trow for the minute, in that brave maiden soul of hers, the, selfishness of our love passed as well as with me.\\n\\nIt was both a great and a sad day for me when I came to go to, Cambridge, great because of my desire for knowledge and the sight of, the world which has ever been strong within me, and, being so, strong, should have led to more; and sad because of my leaving the, little maid without a chance of seeing her for so long a time. She, was then six years old, and a wonder both in beauty and mind to all, who beheld her. I saw much more of her in those days, for my mother\\n\\nMy heart used to leap in a fashion that none would have believed nor, understood, at the blue gleam of her gown and the gold gleam of her, little head through the trees of the park, or through the oaken, shadows of the hall at Cavendish Court during my scant visits there., No maid of my own age drew, for one moment, my heart away from her., She had no rivals except my books, for I was ever an eager scholar\\n\\nOf Dick Barry was no sign to be seen, but Nick lay not dead, but, dead drunk, and over him was crouched one of those black women with, a knife in her hand, and no one molested her, thinking him dead, but, dead he was not, only drunk, and she was wounded herself, with the, blood trickling from her head, unable to carry him from the field as, she had brought him.\\n\\nhitherto leading his horse, he was in his saddle and away, having, first acquainted me anxiously with the fact that he was to wear that, night to the governor's ball a suit of blue velvet with silver, buttons, and asking me if I considered that it would become him in, Mistress Mary's eyes. Then I went home to Drake Hill, passing along, such a wonderful aisle of bloom of locust and peach and mulberry and, honeysuckle and long trails of a purple vine of such a surprise of, beauty as to make one incredible that he saw aright--bushes, pluming white to the wind, and over all a medley of honey and almond, and spicy scents seeming to penetrate the very soul, that I was set, to reflecting in the midst of my sadness of renunciation of my love\\n\\nperhaps, which accounted for his remaining unwedded, although a, lord, though the fact that his estates were incumbered may have had, somewhat to do with it. Be that as it may, he lived alone, except, for a few old servants, and was turned sixty, when, long after my, transportation, he wedded his cook, who gave him three daughters and, one son, to whom the estate went, but the ring and the letter came, to the Chelmsfords. The letter, which I afterwards saw, was a most, curious thing, both as to composition and spelling and chirography\\n\\nand the altar was as white as snow with blossoms. Up the aisle she, flashed, and none but Mary Cavendish could have made that little, journey under the eyes of the governor in his pew and the governor's, lady and all the burgesses, and the churchwarden half starting up as, if to exercise his authority, and the parson swelling with a vast, expanse of sable robes over the Book, with no abashedness and yet no, boldness nor unmaidenly forwardness. There was an innocent gayety on, her face like a child's, and an entire confidence in good will and, loving charity for her tardiness which disarmed all. She looked out, from that gauze love-hood of hers as she came up the aisle, and the, governor, who had a harsh face enough ordinarily, beamed mildly, indulgent. His lady eyed her with a sort of pleasant and reminiscent, wonder, though she was a haughty dame. The churchwarden settled, back, and as for Parson Downs, his great, red face curved in a, smile, and his eyes twinkled under their heavy overhang of florid, brow, and then he declaimed in a hoarser and louder shout than ever, to cover the fact of his wandering attention. And young Sir Humphrey, Hyde, sitting between his mother, Lady Betty, and his sister\\n\\n\\\"My mother thinketh none like me, and so tells me every day, and, says that I am like my father, who was the handsomest man in, England; but then mothers be all so, and I know not how much of it, to trust, and my sister Cicely loves Mary so well herself that she, is jealous, and often tells me--\\\" then the lad stopped and, stared at me, and I at him, perplexed, not dreaming what was in his, mind.\\n\\nI cannot clear thee unless I convict my own granddaughter, Catherine,\\\" she said, piteously, \\\"and if I spared her not, neither, her nor my pride, what of Mary? Catherine hath been like a mother to, the child, and she loves her better than she loves me. 'Twould kill, her, Harry. And, Harry, how can I give Mary to thee, and thou under, this ban? Mary Cavendish cannot wed a convict.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The saints forbid,\\\" he replied. \\\"A secret is a secret only when in, the keeping of one; with two it findeth legs, but with three it, unfoldeth the swiftest wings of flight in all creation, and is, everywhere with no alighting. Had three come to me with that mad, order to bring powder and shot in the stead of silk stockings and, garters and cambric shifts and kerchiefs, I would have clapped full, sail on the Golden Horn, though--\\\" he hesitated, then spoke in a, whisper--\\\"my mind is against tyranny, to speak you true, though, I care not a farthing whether men pray on their knees or their feet\\n\\nwith a great hoot as of laughter, which I am ready to swear I heard, multiplied in a trice, as if the bird were joined by a whole, company, and my horse shied again and would have bolted had I not, held him tightly. Now, this which I am about to relate I am ready to, swear did truly happen, though it may well be doubted. I had come, within a short distance of Jamestown when I reached two houses of a, small size, not far apart, not much removed from the fashion of the, negro cabins, but inhabited by English folk. In the one dwelt a man, who had been transported for a grievous crime, whether justly or not, I cannot say, but his visage was such as to condemn him, and he was, often in his cups and had spent many days in the stocks, and had, made frequent acquaintance with the whipping-post, and with him, dwelt his wife, an old dame with a tongue which had once earned her, the ducking-stool in England. As I passed this house I saw over the, door a great bunch of dill and vervain and white thorn, which is, held to keep away witches from the threshold if gathered upon a May, day. And I knew well the reason, for not many rods distant was the, hut where dwelt one Margery Key, an ancient woman, who had been, verily tied crosswise and thrown in a pond for witchcraft and been, weighed against the church Bible, and had her body searched for, witch-marks and the thatch of her house burned. I know not why she, had not come to the stake withal, but instead she had fled to, Virginia, where, witches being not so common, were treated with more, leniency. It may have been that she had escaped the usual fate of, those of her kind by being considered by some a white witch, and one, who worked good instead of ill if approached rightly, though many, considered that they who approached a white witch for the purpose of, profiting by her advice or warning, were of equal guilt, and that it, all led in the end to mischief. Be that as it may, this old dame, Margery Key dwelt there alone in her little hut so over-thatched and, grown by vines, and scarce showing the shaggy slant of its roof, above the bushes, that it resembled more the hole of some timid and, wary animal than a human habitation. And if any visited her for, consultation it was by night and secretly, and no one ever caught, sight of her except now and then the nodding white frill of her cap, in the green gloom of a window or the painful bend of her old back, as she gathered sticks for her fire in the woods about. How she, lived none knew. A little garden-patch she had, and a hive or two of, bees, and a red cow, which many affirmed to have the eye of a demon\\n\\n\\\"I pray you order the goods unladen at once, Captain Tabor,\\\" she, repeated. Then the captain coloured, for he was quick-witted to, scent a rebuff, though he laughed again in his dare-devil fashion as, he turned to the sailors and shouted out the order, and straightway, the sailors so swarmed hither and thither upon the deck that they, seemed five times as many as before, and then we heard the hatches, flung back with claps like guns.\\n\\nwould have to return to England without a farthing betwixt me and, starvation, and maybe working my way before the mast to get there at, all, had a sting in it. 'Twas a strange thing that anything so noble, and partaking of the divine as the love of an honest man for a woman, should have any tincture of aught ignoble in it, and one is caused, thereby to decry one's state of mortality, which seems as, inseparable from selfish ends as the red wings of a rose from the, thorny stem which binds it to earth. Truly the longer I live the, more am I aware of the speck which mars the completeness of all in, this world, and ever the desire for a better, and that longing which, will not be appeased groweth in my soul, until methinks the very, keenness of the appetite must prove the food.\\n\\nBut they kept up their rollicking late that night, for the window of, my chamber being toward Jamestown, and the wind that way, I could, hear them till I fell asleep. At midnight I wakened suddenly at the, sound of a light laugh, which I knew to be Mary Cavendish's. There, was never in the maid any power of secrecy when her humour overcame, her. She laughed again, and I heard a hushing voice, which I knew to, be neither her sister's nor grandmother's, but a man's.\\n\\nwhose heart had always been sore for a little girl, was often with, Captain Cavendish's wife, for the sake of the child, though the two, women were not of the best accord one with another. Often would I, notice that my mother caressed the child, with only a side attention, for her mother, though that was well disguised by her soft grace of, manner, which seemed to include all present in a room, and I also, noticed that Madam Rosamond Cavendish's sweet mouth would be set in, a straight line with inward dissent at some remark of the other, woman's.\\n\\nThis end of proceedings, with no Bacon to lead us, did not surprise, nor disappoint me. Then, too, the fact that I was cleared of, suspicion of theft in the eyes of her I loved and her family, at, least, filled me with an ecstasy which sometimes awoke me from, slumber like a pain. And though I was quite resolved not to let that, beloved maid fling away herself upon me, unless my innocence was, proven world-wide, and to shield her at all costs to myself, yet, sometimes the hope that in after years I might be able to wed her, and not injure her, started up within me. She came to see me, whenever she could steal away, Madam Cavendish being still in that, state of hatred against me, for my participation in the riot, though, otherwise disposed enough to give her consent to our marriage on the, spot. And every day came my brother John and Catherine, and now and, then Parson Downs. And the parson used to bring me choice spirits in, his pocket, and tobacco, though I could touch only the latter for, fear of inflaming my wounds, and he used to sit and read me some of, Will Shakespeare's Plays, which he bore under his cassock, and a, prayer-book openly in hand, that being the only touch of hypocrisy, which ever I saw about Parson Downs.\\n\\nThen the other woman, who was a strapping lass, and had been a, barmaid ere she came to Virginia in search of a husband, where she, had found one Richard Longman afraid not to do her bidding and wed, her, since he was as small and mild a man as ever was, joined in: \\\"I, say with Mistress Allgood,\\\" she shrieked out, and flung her own, buxom arms aloft with such disclosures that a roar of laughter, spread through the hall, and her husband blushed purple, and a, protest gurgled in his throat. But at that his wife, who verily was, a shrew, seized upon him by both of his little shoulders, and shook, him until his face wagged like a rag baby with an utter limpness of, helplessness, and shouted out, amid peals of laughter that seemed to, shake the roof, that here was a pretty man, here forsooth was a, pretty man. Here was her own husband, who let his own lawful wife go, clad in such wise and lifted not a finger! Yes, lifted not a finger\\n\\nThen came a great challenge of drums, and the parson was in his, saddle and the horses off on the three-mile course, my eyes, following them into the dust-clouded distance, and seeing the parson, come riding in ahead to the winning post, with that curious, uncertainty as to the reality, which had been upon me all the, morning. That is, of the uncertainty of aught save my shameful, abiding in the stocks.\\n\\nand the other women eyeing her, half with defiant glares as of, respectability on the defence, and half with admiration and, comradeship, for she was to the far front in this rebellion as in, the other. Madam Story was a woman so tall that she exceeded the, height of many a man, and she was clad in black, and crowned with a, great hat feathered with sable like a hearse, and her skin was of a, whiteness more dazzling against the black than any colour. Her face, had been handsome had it not been so elongated and strained out of, its proper lines of beauty, and her forehead was of a wonderful, height, a smooth expanse between bunches of black curls, and in the, midst was set that curious patch which she had worn ever since, Bacon's untimely death, it being, as I live, nothing more nor less, than a mourning coach and four horses, cut so cunningly out of black, paper that it was a marvel of skill.\\n\\n\\\"I care not to dance,\\\" said she pettishly, and with a glance of, mingled wrath and admiration at Mary Cavendish that might have, matched mine or her brother's, and I marvelled deeply at the, waywardness of a maid's heart. But then came Ralph Drake, who had, not drunken very deeply, being only flushed, and somewhat lost to, discrimination, and disposed to dance with another since he could, not have his cousin Mary, and he and Cicely went away together, and, presently, when the minuet was over and another dance on, I saw them, advancing in time, but always Cicely had that eye of watchful injury, upon Mary.\\n\\nwhither she had flung it, for the caprices of a baby are beyond, those of the wind, being indeed human inclination without rudder nor, compass. Then I did an ungallant and ungenerous thing, for which I, have always held myself in light esteem: I gathered up that ribbon, and carried it to my brother and told him where I had found it, but, all to small purpose as regarded my jealousy, as he scarce gave it a, thought, and the next day gave the little maid a silver button\\n\\n, The first man my eyes fell upon was Parson Downs, lolling in a chair, by the fireless hearth, for there was no call for fire that May, night. His bulk of body swept in a vast curve from his triple chin, to the floor, and his great rosy face was so exaggerated with, merriment and good cheer that it looked like one seen in the shining, swell of a silver tankard. When Nick Barry finished a roaring song\\n\\n, Such a blaze of light as was the governor's mansion house that night, I never saw, and I heard the music of violins, and hautboys, and, viola da gambas coming from within, and a silvery babble of women's, tongues, with a deeper undertone of men's, and the tread of dancing, feet, and the stamping of horses outside, with the whoas of the, negro boys in attendance, and through the broad gleam of the, moonlight came the flare and smoke of the torches. It seemed as if, the whole colony was either dancing at the governor's ball or, standing outside on tiptoe with interest. I sat waiting for some, time, holding my restive horse as best I might, but there coming no, cessation in the music, I dismounted, and seeing one of Madam, Cavendish's black men, gave him the bridle to hold, and went up to, the house and entered, though not in my plum-coloured velvet, and\\n\\nThen as suddenly that mood left her, as she sat there, the sailors, having risen, and standing staring with shamefaced respect, and, covertly wiping with the hairy backs of hands their mouths red with, wine. But the captain, one Calvin Tabor, stood before them with more, assurance, as if he had some warrant for allowing such license among, his men; he himself seemed not to have been drinking. Mistress Mary, regarded them, holding in Merry Roger with her firm little hand\\n\\nThen Sir Humphrey loosed her, and straight to me she came and bent, over me and kissed me. \\\"Harry,\\\" she said in a whisper which was of, that strange quality that it seemed to be unable to be heard by any, in the whole world save us two, though it was clear enough--\\\"I, leave thee because thou tellest me that this is the only way to save, thee, but I am thine for life and for death, and nothing shall ever, come forever between thee and me, not even thine own self, nor the, grave, nor all the wideness of life.\\\"\\n\\nBut then I was on my feet, and, facing them both with my head flung, back and my face, I dare say, red and white with wrath, and, demanding hotly what that might be to them, and if my treatment at, the hands of my stepfather and my own mother was not between them, and me, and none else, and, boy as I was, I felt as tall as Captain, Cavendish as I stood there. Captain Cavendish stared a moment and, reddened and frowned, and then his gaunt face widened with his ever, ready laugh which made it passing sweet for a man.\\n\\nher old face now ivory-yellow, but with a wonderful precision of, feature, for she had been a great beauty in her day, so alert and, alive with the ready comprehension of her black eyes, under slightly, scowling brows, that naught escaped her that was within her reach of, vision. Somewhat dull was she of hearing, but that sharpness of eye, did much to atone for it. She looked up, when we entered, with such, keenness that for a second my thought was that she knew all.\\n\\nSir Humphrey kept the road with us for some distance after we had, left the others, gazing beside the horse-block, all equally desirous, of following, but knowing well that it would not be a fair deed to, the maid to attend her homeward on the Sabbath day with a whole, troop of lovers. But Sir Humphrey Hyde leapt to his saddle and rode, abreast with no ado, being ever minded to do what seemed good to, himself, unless, indeed, his mother stood in the way of his, pleasure. Sir Humphrey's mother, Lady Clarissa Hyde, was one of, those unwitting tyrants which one sees among women, by reason of her, exceeding delicacy and gentleness, which made it seem but the, cruelty of a brute to cross her, and thus had her own way forever\\n\\nI put my finger to my lip and cast a glance about, for it was, enjoined upon the people under penalty that they speak not ill of, any minister of the gospel. While I cared not for myself, having, never yet held my tongue, except from my own choice, yet was I, always concerned for this young thing, with her utter recklessness, of candour, lest her beauty and her charm might not protect her, always against undesirable results; and not only were the slaves, within hearing of her voice, but none knew how many others, for, those were brave days for tale-bearers. But Mary spoke again, and, more sweetly and shrilly than ever. \\\"A pretty parson, forsooth! And, to keep company with a pirate captain! Fie! When he looks at me, I, clutch my gold chain and turn the flash of my rings from sight, and, Dick and Nick Barry are the worst rakes in the colony! Naught was, ever heard good of them, except their following of General Bacon\\n\\nI was set upon Major Robert Beverly's tomb as a most desirable, hiding place for them, and knowing that there was a meeting of the, Assembly that evening at the governor's, to discuss some matters in, private before he sailed for England, Major Beverly being clerk, I, thought that before the moon was up would be a favourable time for, the removal, but I could not move the goods alone, remembering how, those sturdy sailors tugged at them, and not deeming it well to get, any aid from the slaves.\\n\\nWhen I first saw Mary Cavendish she was, as I said before, a little, baby maid of two and I a loutish lad of fourteen, and I was going, through the park of Cavendish Hall, which lay next ours, one morning, in May, when all the hedges were white and pink, and the blue was, full of wings and songs. Cavendish Hall had been vacant, save for a, caretaker, that many a day. Francis Cavendish, the owner, had been, for years in India, but he had lately died, and now the younger, brother, Geoffry, Mary's father, had come home from America to take, possession of the estate, and he brought with him his daughter, Catherine by a former marriage, a maid a year older than I; his, second wife, a delicate lady scarce more than a girl, and his little, daughter Mary.\\n\\nLoving Mary Cavendish as I did, and striving to look at him with her, eyes, a sort of tenderness crept into my heart for this simple, lover, who was as brave as he was simple, and I clapped a hand on, his fair curls, for though he was so tall I was taller, and laughed, and said, \\\"If I were a maid, though 'tis a fancy to rack the brain\\n\\nholding myself before her as firmly as I might, there came a quick, clatter of hoofs, and Mistress Mary had dashed alongside on Merry, Roger. She scattered the merry revellers right and left, calling out, to her sister to go homeward with a laugh. \\\"Fie on thee, Catherine!\\\", she cried out. \\\"If thou art abroad on a May morning dressed like the, queen of it, what blame can there be to these good folk for giving, thee thy queendom?\\\"\\n\\nThen the poor lad coloured and stammered, and could not look me in, the face, but it was enough. \\\"Let there be no more talk betwixt you, and me as to that matter, Sir Humphrey,\\\" I said. \\\"There is never now, nor at any other time any question of marriage betwixt Mistress Mary, Cavendish and her convict tutor, and if he perchance had been not, colour-blind and had learned to appraise her at her rare worth, the, more had he been set against such. And all that he can do for thee\\n\\nand was off adown the road toward Jarvis Field, with loud clamour of, bells and horns and wild dancing and wavings of their gad-sticks and, green branches. Mistress Mary rode before us at a gallop, and, presently we were all at the breakfast table in the great hall at, Drake Hill, with foaming tankards of metheglin and dishes of honey, and salmon and game in plenty. For, whatever the scarcity of the, king's gold, there was not much lack of food in this rich country.\\n\\nIt is here that I shall stop the course of my story to explain the, whole matter of the ring, which at the time I was too weak and spent, with pain to comprehend fully as Catherine Cavendish related it. It, was a curious and at the same time a simple tale, as such tales are, wont to be, and its very simplicity made it seem then, and seem now\\n\\nwho had been a staunch old royalist, having died. There were acres, of tobacco, and whole fields of locust for the manufacture of, metheglin, and apple orchards from which cider enough to slack the, thirst of the colony was made. But the brothers were far from, content with such home-made liquors for their own drinking, but, imported from England and the Netherlands and Spain great stores of, ale and rum and wines, and held therewith high wassail with some, choice and kindred spirits, especially on the Sabbath.\\n\\nWhen they had passed back on the turf I lay with my boyish heart in, a rage with the insults, both of pity and of praise, which had been, offered me; for why should pity be offered unless there be the, weakness of betrayal of suffering to warrant it, and why should, there be praise unless there be craving for it, through the weakness, of wronged conceit? Be that as it may, my book no longer interested, me, and finally I rose up and went away after having deposited all, my nuts on the grass in the hope that the little maid might chance, that way and espy them.\\n\\nand he died and was buried at sea, and I, when I arrived in this, kingdom of Virginia, with the dire uncertainty and hardship of the, convict before me, yet with strength and readiness to bear it, was, taken as a tutor by Madam Judith Cavendish for her granddaughter, Mary, being by education well fitted for such a post, and she, herself knowing her other reasons for so doing. And so it happened, that Mistress Mary Cavendish and I rode to meeting in Jamestown that, Sabbath in April of 1682.\\n\\n, I had not formed my plan of taking part in the coming insurrection, without many misgivings lest I should by so doing bring harm upon, the Cavendishes. But on discussing the matter in all its bearings, with Major Robert Beverly, whom I had ever held to be a man of, judgment, he assured me that in his opinion there could no possible, ill result come to such a household of women, especially when the, head of it was of such openly-avowed royalist leanings. Unless\\n\\nThe lad was blushing with delight and confusion like a girl. He cast, down his eyes before me; he stammered when he spoke. \\\"Harry, if she, but love me, I swear I could do as brave deeds as Bacon,\\\" he said., \\\"I would die would she but carry about a lock of my hair on her, bosom as she does his. I would, Harry. And you think I have some, chance?\\\"\\n\\nlike a winged shadow, and again I heard the owl's hoot, and ever, before us, like a white arrow, fled that white cat, and my horse, followed in spite of me. Then, verily I speak the truth, though it, may well be questioned, did that white cat lead us straight to the, tomb which Major Beverly had made upon his plantation at the death, of his first wife, and in which she lay, and 'twas on a rising above, the creek, and then the cat, with a wail which was like nothing I, ever heard in this world, was away in a straight line toward the, silver gleam of the creek, though every one knows well how cats hate, water, and had disappeared. But, though to this I will not swear, I, thought I saw a white gleam aloft, and heard a wail of a cat skyward, along with the owl-hoots. And then my horse stood and trembled in, such wise that I thought he would fall under me, and I dismounted, and stroked his head and tried as best I could to soothe him, and we, were all the time before the tomb, which was a large one. Then of a, sudden it came to me that here was the hiding-place for the powder, and shot, for what safer hiding-place can there be than the tomb of, the first wife, when the second hath reigned but a short time, and, is fair, and hath but just given her lord that little darling whose, cries of appealing helplessness I could hear even there? So I gave, the tomb-door a pull, knowing that I should not, by so doing\\n\\n, My profession has been that of a tutor, and it thus befell that I, was under the necessity of learning as much as I was able, and even, going out of my way to seek those lessons at which all the pages of, life are open for us, and even, as it were, turning over wayside, stones, and looking under wayside weeds in the search for them; and, it scarcely ever chanced that I did not get some slight savour of, knowledge therefrom, though I was far enough from the full solution, of the problems. And through these lessons I seemed to gain some, increase of wisdom not only of the matters of which the lessons, themselves treated, such as the courses of the stars and planets\\n\\nhad she but let loose the leash in which she held herself, would, have joined those dancing and singing lasses and been outdone by, none, there was a sudden halt; then, before I knew what was to, happen, around her leapt a laughing score of them, shouting that, here was the true Maid Marion, and that old John Lubberkin could now, resign his post. Then off the hobby-horse they tumbled him, and the, lads and lasses gathering around her, and the graybeards standing, aloof with some chagrin, would, I believe, in spite of me, since, they outnumbered me vastly, have forced Catherine into that rude, pageant as Maid Marion. But while I was thrusting them aside\\n\\nwithdrew a little from me, and made no further efforts to get rid of, me, but sat still watching the unlading with a gravity which gave me, a vague uneasiness. I began to have a feeling that here was more, than appeared on the surface, and my suspicion grew as I watched the, sailors lift those boxes which were supposed to contain Mistress, Mary's finery. In the first place there were enough of them to, contain the wardrobe of a lady in waiting, in the second place they, were of curious shape for such purposes, in the third place 'twas, all those lusty English sailors could do to lift them.\\n\\nWhen the cases were all deposited in the great room, Mistress Mary, held a short conference apart with Captain Calvin Tabor, and I saw, some gold pass from her hand to his. Then she thanked him and the, sailors for their trouble very prettily in that way she had which, would have made every one as willing to die for her as to carry, heavy weights. Then we all filed out from the house, and Mistress, Mary locked the door, and bade good-bye to Captain Tabor; then he, and his men took again the bridle-path back to the ship, and she and, I proceeded churchward on the highway.\\n\\n\\\"Madam,\\\" said I, \\\"I forbid you to do that again,\\\" and as I spoke I, saw her little fingers twitch on her whip, but she dared not raise, it. She laughed as a child will who knows she is at fault and is, scared by her consciousness of guilt and would conceal it by a, bravado of merriment; then she said in the sweetest, wheedling tone, that I had ever heard from her, and I had known her from her, childhood:\\n\\nMadam Cavendish was still in her bedchamber, and the two sisters and, I dined together in the great hall. Then, after the meal was over, I, went forth with my book of Sir William Davenant's plays, and sought, a favourite place of mine in the woods, and stayed there till, sundown. Then, rising and going homeward when the mist floated over, the marshlands like veils of silver gauze, and the frogs chorused, through it in waves of sound, and birds were circling above it\\n\\nand a kettle in the fireplace, with a little pile of sticks and a, great scattering of ashes, but no one there, and also, if I may be, believed, _no broom._ All this I tell for what it may be worth to, the credulity of them who hear; the facts be such as I have said., But whether believing it myself or not, yet knowing that that white, cat, though it had been Margery Key in such guise, or her familiar, imp on his way to join her at some revel whither she had ridden her, broom, had done me good service, and, seeing the piteous smallness, of the pile of sticks on the hearth, and reflecting upon the, distressful bend of the old soul's back, whether she had sold, herself to Satan or not, I lingered a minute to break down a goodly, armful of brush in the wood outside and carry inside for the, replenishment of her store. And as I came forth, having done so, I, heard the door of the nearby house open, and saw two white faces, peering out at me, and heard a woman's voice shriek shrilly that, here was the devil seeking the witch, and though I called out to, reassure them, the door clapped to with a bang like a pistol-shot\\n\\n\\\"Hush,\\\" said Catherine. \\\"Our grandmother hath but locked her in her, chamber, since she hath discovered her love for thee, and frowns, upon it, not since thou art a convict, but since thou hast turned, against the King. She says that no granddaughter of hers shall wed a, rebel, be he convict or prince. But she is safe, Harry, and there, will no harm come to her, and indeed I think that if they in, authority have heard aught of what she hath done, they are minded to, keep it quiet, and--and--\\\"\\n\\nMadam Cavendish was at table that night, though moving with grimaces, from the stiffness of her rheumatic joints, and she ordered that the, sailors be given cider, the which they drank with some haste, and, were gone. Then Madam Cavendish asked Mistress Mary, with her, wonderful keenness of gaze, which I never saw excelled, \\\"Are those, the goods which you ordered by the Golden Horn?\\\" But I answered for, her, knowing that Madam Cavendish would pardon such presumption from, me. \\\"Madam, those are the goods. I have it from Capt. Calvin Tabor, himself.\\\" I spoke with no roundings nor glossings of subterfuge\\n\\n\\\"Harry, how got you that wound on your shoulder? Answer me, sir,\\\", said Colonel Chelmsford, his voice gathering wrath anew. But I, remained silent. I do not, to this day, know why, except that to, tell of any service rendered has always seemed to me to attaint the, honour of the teller, and how much more when it was a service toward, that little maid! So I kept my silence.\\n\\nBut I needed no urging. I know not whom I rode down, I trust not, any, but I know not; I got before them all in some wise, Sir, Humphrey following close behind, and Ralph Drake also, swearing that, he knew not what possessed the jades to meddle in such matters, and, shouting to the rabble to stop, but he might as well have shouted to, the wind. And by that time there were more than a hundred of us\\n\\nswore at first that he would be damned if he would stop better, business to parley with a damned convict tutor; but the end of it, was that he and the Barry brothers and Parson Downs and I stood, together under that mighty humming locust tree, and I unfolded my, scheme of moving the powder and shot from Locust Creek to Major, Robert Beverly's tomb. Noel Jaynes stared at me a second, with his, hard red face agape, and then he clapped me upon the shoulder, and, shouted with laughter, and swore that it should be done, and that it, was a burning hell shame that the goods had been put where they were, to the risk of a maid of beauty like Mary Cavendish, and that he and, the Barrys would be with me that very night before moonrise to move, them.\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" cried Mary, \\\"will I tell thee, Master Wingfield, what it, means. He cannot betray us, Humphrey, for his tongue is tied with, honour, even if he be not on our side. But he is on our side, as is, every true Englishman.\\\" Then Mary Cavendish leaned far out the, window, and a white lace scarf she wore floated forth, and she cried, with a great burst of triumph and childish enthusiasm: \\\"I will tell, thee what it means, Master Wingfield, I will tell thee what it, means; I am but a maid, but the footsteps of General Bacon be yet, plain enough to follow in this soil of Virginia, and--and--the king, gets not our tobacco crops!\\\"\\n\\n, I lay in prison until the twenty-ninth day of May, Royal Oak Day. I, know not quite how it came to pass, but none of my brother's efforts, toward my release met with any success. I heard afterward some, whispers as to the cause, being that so many of high degree were, concerned in the riots, and that if I, a poor devil of a convict, tutor, were let off too cheaply, why then the rest of them must be, let loose only at a rope's end, and that it would never do to send, me back to Drake Hill scot free, while Sir Humphrey Hyde and Major, Robert Beverly and my Lord Estes, and others, were in durance, and, some high in office in great danger of discovery. At all events\\n\\n\\\"It may be that she had not her wits,\\\" I said. \\\"Such things have, been, I have heard, and especially in the case of a woman with, jewels. It may be that she knew not what she did, and in any case I, pray you to think no more of it, dear madam.\\\" And all the time I, spoke I was smoothing her old forehead under the flapping frills of, her cap.\\n\\nThe physician, long since dead, and an old man at that date, was, exceeding silent, eyeing everybody with an anxious corrugation of, brows over sharp eyes, and he had always a nervous clutch of his, hands to accompany the glance, as if for lancets or the necks of, medicine-flasks, never leaving a patient, unless he had killed or, cured. He had visited me with as much faithfulness as if I had been, the governor, and yet with no kindness, and I know not to this day\\n\\nto come nearer and assist me to hold the door. Then I saw Captain, Jaynes sink in his saddle, and I caught a glimpse of a mighty, retreat of plunging haunches of Parson Downs' horse, and indeed the, gist of the blame for it all was afterward put upon the parson's, great fiery horse, which it was claimed had run away with him first, into the fight, then away from it, such foolish reasons do men love, to give for the lapses of the clergy.\\n\\nNevertheless, I saw with some misgivings these honest fellows, plodding their ways, ready to leap to their deaths maybe at the word, of command, when it did not concern their own interests in the, least, and especially when they had not that order of mind which, enables a man to have a delight in glory and in serving those broad, ends of humanity which include a man to his own loss.\\n\\nThen, indeed, for the first time in my life and the last I answered, a woman as if she were a man, and on an equal footing of antagonism, with me. \\\"Madam,\\\" I replied, \\\"I will maintain my honour against your, own.\\\" But she seemed to make no account of what I said. Indeed I, have often wondered whether a woman, when she is in pursuit of any, given end, can progress by other methods than an ant, which hath no, power of circuitousness, and will climb over a tree with long labour, and pain rather than skirt it, if it come in her way. Straight at, her purpose she went. \\\"Harry, Harry,\\\" she said, still in that sharp, whisper, \\\"you will not, you cannot--she is but a child.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They be the heaviest furbelows that ever maiden wore,\\\" I thought as, I watched them strain at the cases, both hauling and pulling, with, many men to the ends to get them through the hatch, then ease them, to the deck, with regard to the nipping of fingers. I noted, too, an, order given somewhat privately by Captain Tabor to put out the, pipes, and noted that not one man but had stowed his away.\\n\\nWe were not yet in sight of Drake Hill, but the morning smoke from, the slave cabins had begun to thrust itself athwart the honeyed, sweetness of blossoms, and the salt freshness of the breath of the, tidal river, as the homely ways of life will ever do athwart the, beauty and inspiration of it, maybe to the making of its true, harmony, when of a sudden we both stopped and listened. Mistress, Catherine turned palely to me, and I dare say the thought of Indians, was in her mind, though they had long been quiet, then her face, relaxed and she smiled.\\n\\nindeed, he admitted, the bringing over of the arms and the powder, was to be traced to Mistress Mary Cavendish. This he said, not, knowing the secret of his first wife's tomb, and I feeling, as, indeed I was, an arch deceiver. But what other course is left open, to any man, when he can shield the one he loves best in the whole, world only at the expense of some one else? Can he do otherwise but, let the other suffer, and even forfeit his sense of plain dealing? I, have lived to be an old man, and verily nothing hath so grown in the, light of my experience as the impossibility of serving love except, at a loss, not only to others, but to oneself. But that truth of the, greatest importance in the whole world hath also grown upon me, that, love should be served at whatever cost. I cared not then, and I care, not now, who suffered and who was wronged, if only that beloved one, was saved.\\n\\nor in gowns or the fashion of Eden. And I care not if they pray at, all, nor would I for the sake of that ever have forsaken, had I, stood in my grandfather's shoes, the flesh-pots of old England for, that howling wilderness of Plymouth. But for the sake of doing as I, willed, and not as any other man, would I have sailed or swam the, seas had they been blood instead of water. And so am I now with a, due regard to the wind and the trim of my sails and the ears of, tale-bearers, for a man hath but one head to lose with you of, Virginia. But, the Lord, to make a little maid like that run the, risk of imprisonment or worse, knew you aught of it, sir?\\\"\\n\\nSuch quickness of wit I had often heard ascribed to women, but never, saw I aught like that, and I trow it seemed witchcraft. \\\"'Tis, something about the young tobacco plants,\\\" quoth she. \\\"The king, would not pass the measure to cease the planting, and the assembly, of this spring broke up with no decision. Major Beverly, who, is clerk of the assembly, hath turned against the government, since Bacon died, and all the burgesses are with him, and, Governor Culpeper sails for England soon, and what, is the, lieutenant-governor to hold the reins? There is a plot hatching to, cut down the young tobacco plants.\\\" I could but stare at her. \\\"There, is a plot to cut down the young tobacco plants as soon as the, governor hath sailed,\\\" she said, \\\"and my sister Mary hath sent to, England for arms, knowing that the militia will arise and there will, be fighting.\\\"\\n\\nand henceforth thou shall cross with thy adversaries for all me.\\\", Then he laughed again, and I stared at him still grimly but, softened, and he and Mr. Abbot moved on, but the attorney, in, passing, laid his great white hand on my black mane of hair as if he, would bless me, and I shrank away from under it, and when he said in, that voice of his, \\\"'Tis a gallant lad and one to do good service, for his king and country,\\\" I would that he had struck me that I, might have justly hit back.\\n\\nThe morning of the day after the sailing, the people of Jamestown, whom one happened to meet on the road had a strange expression of, countenance, and I doubt not that a man skilled in such matters, could have read as truly the signs of an eruption of those forces of, human passion in the hearts of men, as of an earthquake by the, belching forth of smoke and fire from the mouth of a volcano., Everybody looked at his neighbour with either a glare of doubt and, wariness, or with covert understanding, and some there were who had, a pale seriousness of demeanour from having a full comprehension of, the situation and of what might come of it, though not in the least, drawing back on that account, and some were all flushed and glowing, with eagerness and laughing from sheer delight in danger and daring\\n\\nI entered and found a great company assembled in the hall, and all, equipped with knives for the cutting of the tobacco plants, and, arms, for the militia, as was afterwards proved, was an uncertain, quantity. One minute the soldiers were for the government, when the, promises as to their pay were specious, and the next, when the pay, was not forthcoming, for the rioters, and there was no stability, either for the one cause or the other in them.\\n\\nBut Madam Cavendish stared at me with unreasoning anger, not, understanding, since she was a woman, and unreasoning as a woman, will be in such matters. \\\"If you love not my granddaughter, Harry, Wingfield,\\\" she cried out, \\\"'tis not her grandmother will fling her, at your head. I will let you know, sir, that she could have her pick, in the colony if she so chose, and it may be that she might not, choose you, Master Harry Wingfield.\\\"\\n\\n, It was dawn before we were abed, but I for one had no sleep, being, strained to such a pitch of rapture and pain by what I had, discovered. The will I had not, to take the joy which I seemed to, see before me like some brimming cup of the gods, but not yet, in, the first surprise of knowing it offered me, the will to avoid the, looking upon it, and the tasting of it in dreams. Over and over I, said to myself, and every time with a new strengthening of, resolution, that Mary Cavendish should not love me, and that in some, way I would force her to obey me in that as in other things, never, doubting that I could do so. Well I knew that she could not wed a, convict, nor could I clear myself unless at the expense of her, sister Catherine, and sure I was that she would not purchase love, itself at such a cost as that. There remained nothing but to turn, her fancy from me, and that seemed to me an easy task, she being but, a child, and having, I reasoned, but little more than a childish, first love for me, which, as every one knows, doth readily burn, itself out by its excess of wick, and lack of substantial fuel. And, yet, as I lay on my bed with the red dawn at the windows, and the, birds calling outside, and the scent of the opening blossoms, entering invisible, such pangs of joy and ecstasy beyond anything, which I had ever known on earth overwhelmed me that I could not, resist them. Knowing well that in the end I should prove my, strength, for the time I gave myself to that advance of man before, the spur of love, which I doubt not is after the same fashion as the, unfolding of the flowers in the spring, and the nesting of the, birds, and the movement of the world itself from season to season\\n\\nI stood there, and Captain Waller rode up with his soldiers, and, flashing his sword before my face like a streak of fire, bade me, surrender in the name of his Majesty, and stand aside. But I stood, still with my two pistols levelled, and had him full within range., Captain Waller was a young man, and a brave one, and never to my, dying day shall I forget that face which I had the power to still, with death. He looked into the muzzles of my two pistols, and his, rosy colour never wavered, and he shouted out again to me his, command to surrender and stand aside in the name of the King, and I, stood still and made no reply. I knew that I could take two lives, and then struggle unarmed for perhaps a moment's space, and that all, the time saved might be precious for those in the house. At all, events, it was all that I could do for Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nwaiting anxiously, Catherine Cavendish. She listened with deepening, eyes while I told her Captain Tabor's scheme, and when I had done, looked at me with her beautiful mouth set and her face as white as a, white flower on a bush beside her. \\\"Mary shall show the goods,\\\" said, she. \\\"Such a story will I tell her as will make her innocent of, aught save bewilderment, and as for you and me, we are both of us, ready to burn for a lie for the sake of her.\\\"\\n\\nand some were like stolid beasts of the field watching the eye of a, master, ready at its wink to leap forth to the strain of labour or, fury. Many of these last were of our English labourers, whom I held, in some sort of pity, and doubt as to whether it were just and, merciful to draw them into such a stew kettle, for in truth many of, them had not a pound of tobacco to lose by the Navigation Act, and, no more interest in the uprising than had the muskets stacked in, Major Robert Beverly's first wife's tomb. Yet, I pray, what can men, do without tools, and have not tools some glory of their own which, we take small account of, and yet which may be a recompense to them?\\n\\nall crowned and crested with green, like a tidal wave of spring, but, another argument came to me, and that moved her. \\\"'Tis not yourself, alone, but your sister and Madam Cavendish to suffer with you,\\\" I, said. Then she gave a quick glance at Catherine, who was raising her, white face and trying to get near enough to speak to her, for her, sister's speech had made her frantic with alarm, and hesitated. Then, she laughed, and the earnest look faded from her face, and she, called out with that way of hers which nobody and nothing could, withstand, \\\"Nay,\\\" she said, \\\"wait till I be older and have as much, wisdom in my head as hath the Maid Marion whom you have chosen. The, one who hath seen so many Mays can best know how to queen it over, them.\\\" So saying, she snatched the wreath with which they had, crowned her from her head and cast it with such a sweep of grace as, never I saw over the head of flax-headed and masked Maid Marion, and, reined her horse back, and the crowd, with worshipful eyes of, admiration of her and her sweetness and wit and beauty, gave way\\n\\nwhich might have been my fate, had I been a free man, nor knew that, another was released on condition that he build a bridge over, Dragon's Swamp. This last chance, my friends had striven sorely to, get for me, but had not succeeded, though they had offered large, sums, my brother being willing to tax the estate heavily. Some, covert will there was at work against me, and it may be I could, mention it, but I like not mentioning covert wills, but only such as, be downright, and exercised openly in the faces of all men. I lay, there not so uncomfortably, being aware of a great delight that the, tobacco was cut, whether or no, as indeed it was on many, plantations, and the King cheated out of great wealth.\\n\\nAs he spoke I seemed to see that dead hero as he would have looked, in our midst with the moonlight shining on the stern whiteness of, his face, and that look of high command in his eyes which none dared, gainsay. And I answered again and again, as with an impulse not my, own, \\\"And maybe Bacon in truth leads us still, if not by his own, chosen ways, to his own ends.\\\"\\n\\nall at once, Mistress Mary swerved off from the main road and was, riding down the track leading to the plantation-wharf, whence all, the tobacco was shipped for England and all the merchandise imported, for household use unladen. There the way was very wet and the mire, was splashed high upon Mistress Mary's fine tabby skirt, but she, rode on at a reckless pace, and I also, much at a loss to know what, had come to her, yet not venturing, or rather, perhaps, deigning to, inquire. And then I saw what she had doubtless seen before, the, masts of a ship rising straightly among the trees with that, stiffness and straightness of dead wood, which is beyond that of, live, unless, indeed, in a storm at sea, when the wind can so, inspirit it, that I have seen a mast of pine possessed by all the, rage of yielding of its hundred years on the spur of a mountain.\",\n          \"Ten minutes later the crowd was on the way to the river, to a dock, where lay the motor-boat. It was not a very elegant craft, but it had, a good engine and could travel well--and that, just then, meant, everything to the Rover boys. A bargain was struck for the run, and, the boys and the owner got aboard. And then the search for the, schooner was begun anew.\\n\\nA short while later an alarming thing occurred. The boys were out in, the Dartaway when they met Grace on the road and learned that Dora and, Nellie had been abducted by Josiah Crabtree, Tad Sobber, and some of, their other old enemies. They gave chase in the biplane, and, after, several adventures, located the girls in a lonely mansion in the, country, where they were prisoners, in charge of Sobber's aunt The, boys at once went for the authorities, and, after something of a, fight, the rascals were made prisoners, and the girls were rescued and, taken back to the Seminary.\\n\\nFollowing the sending out of the invitations to the wedding, presents, had come in thick and fast to the Stanhope home. From Dick's father, came an elegant silver service, and from his brothers a, beautifully-decorated dinner set; while Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, contributed a fine set of the latest encyclopaedias, and a, specially-bound volume of the uncle's book on scientific farming! Mr., Anderson Rover also contributed a bank book with an amount written, therein that nearly took away Dora's breath.\\n\\nThere were two matters of importance--the irrigation scheme and the, purchase of a large tract of land which would be benefited by the flow, of water, when the irrigation plant was put into operation. In both of, the schemes the Rovers held large interests--that is, they held what, were called options, for which Anderson Rover had put up large sums of, money, and he had likewise induced some friends to let him put up, money for them. In order to clinch their hold on the two business, propositions Anderson Rover must sign certain papers and have them, delivered to the right parties inside of the next three days. Should, he fail to do this, then his options on the property would terminate\\n\\n\\\"Um! Nervous, eh? Well, a few days of quietness will remedy that,\\\", answered the lawyer. \\\"Now, see here.\\\" He looked wisely at the three, Rovers. \\\"Our railroad disclaims all responsibility for this accident., But at the same time we--er--we want to do the right thing, you, know--rather do that than have any unpleasant feelings, understand?, Now if you are willing to accept our offer, we'll fix this matter, right up and say no more about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow morning?\\\" Tom heard him ask \\\"What time? Ten o'clock. That, is rather early, but I can go there directly from my home.\\\" There came, another pause. \\\"Leave that to me,\\\" cried the man. \\\"I'll make him do, it!\\\" He paused again. \\\"I am not afraid of those boys,\\\" he added. \\\"I'll, be there, sure.\\\" Another pause. \\\"Yes, the boat is the best place., Nobody can disturb us there. Good-bye.\\\" And then the man hung up the, telephone receiver.\\n\\n\\\"The two brokers are in that room,\\\" whispered Dick, pointing to the, door of the apartment. \\\"They are planning to skip out to Canada and, leave their affairs in the hands of the lawyer who has rented this, apartment. He is almost as much of a rascal as any of them, for he is, to take their power of attorney dated some days back, and is going to, try to prove an alibi for them. I heard 'em arrange the whole thing.\\\"\\n\\nHe and Jesse Pelter hustled Anderson Rover back, and then the boys saw, their father disappear from view. Swiftly the tug and the schooner, gathered headway. The boys shouted in vain. They looked around for, some other boat to come to their aid, but none was in sight. Then the, schooner passed down the Hudson River and the Rover boys were left in, the rowboat, gazing at each other in dismay.\\n\\nIt must not be thought that in those days the girls at Hope Seminary, were forgotten. Whenever the Rover boys got a chance they visited the, place, and many a nice time they and the girls had together. On those, occasions Dick and Dora would roam off together, the others making no, attempt to follow them, and the pair would plan the many things they, hoped to do in the future.\\n\\n\\\"I've got the front room all ready for you,\\\" went on the aunt. And she, led the way into the house and to the apartment in question. Here the, sufferer was put to bed, and his aunt did all in her power to make him, comfortable. The local doctor had already been notified, and soon he, appeared, to read a note written by the city specialist and listen to, what Sam had to tell him. Then he took charge and said Tom must be, kept very quiet.\\n\\nHe had already given the particulars of how he had been kidnapped, while on his way to meet Japson. The broker had come up accompanied by, the disguised Crabtree, and he had been forced into a taxicab and a, sponge saturated with chloroform had been held to his nose. He had, become unconscious, and while in that condition had been taken to some, house up in Harlem. From there he had been transferred to the Ellen, Rodney on the evening before the boys had discovered his whereabouts.\\n\\nThis term at Putnam Hall was followed by a long journey on land and, sea, to a far-away island of the Pacific, where the boys and their, friends had to play \\\"Robinson Crusoe\\\" for a while. Then they returned, to this country, and, in a houseboat, sailed down the Ohio and the, Mississippi Rivers. After leaving the Mississippi they took an outing, on the plains, and then went down into southern waters, where, in the, Gulf of Mexico, they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.\\n\\n\\\"Not exactly, Dora--and yet I don't think I am exactly fitted for a, professional career. That seems to be more in Tom and Sam's line. I, like business, and I'd enjoy getting into something big, something, worth while. I think I could handle those matters, if father would, only let me try. And then there is another thing, Dora,\\\" went on the, youth, looking squarely into his companion's face. \\\"Perhaps you can, guess what that is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After a while Pelter and Japson came to me and said they must come up, the river--that a sister of the crazy man lived up here, and they, must visit her before they went down the coast. I was suspicious, but, what could I do? I had chartered my vessel and I had my money, so I, obeyed orders. Then we came up here as fast as we could. The steam tug, was dismissed, and we came ashore to this place. Then they hired an, auto and went off--and that's all I know about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to leave you out--I want you to be doing something, else, for we have no time to lose in this matter. I want you, Sam, to, come with me, and when I go into the offices, I want you to hang, around outside and watch for old Crabtree. If he is in league with the, brokers he may be looking for a chance to interview them, but he will, be on his guard, knowing that we are here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get a chance to listen. As I was coming up I saw the first, man give the second man some money. Then the second man looked up and, saw me, and shoving the money into his pocket, he dove across the, street and into the crowd. That made me feel sure it was Crabtree, and, I ran after him pell-mell. I followed him for about half a block. But, the crowd was too much for me, and he got away. I was going to tell a, policeman, but then I thought he couldn't do any more than I could\\n\\nFour days later the youngest Rover got permission from the specialist, who had attended Tom to take him home. An easy-riding automobile was, procured, and in this the two brothers drove to the nearest railroad, station. A compartment in a parlor car had already been engaged, and, Tom was placed in this and made as comfortable as circumstances, permitted. The ride was a long and tedious one for the youth, and by, the time he had made the necessary changes to get to Oak Run he was, pretty well exhausted, and had a severe headache.\\n\\nand also a full supply of table and other linen. From Captain Putnam, came a handsome morris chair, and Songbird sent in a beautifully-bound, volume of household poetry, with a poem of his own on the flyleaf. The, students of Brill sent in a fine oil painting in a gold frame, and the, girls at Hope contributed an inlaid workbox with a complete sewing, outfit. From Dan Baxter, who had been invited, along with the young, lady to whom he was engaged, came two gold napkin rings, each suitably, engraved. Dan had written to Dick, saying he would come to the wedding, if he had to take a week off to get there, he being then in Washington, on a business trip.\\n\\nDuring the past year a room had been added to the house and this was, used as a library and sort of office combined, being provided with a, substantial safe and two roller-top desks. One of the desks was used, exclusively by Anderson Rover for his private letters and papers. When, sick the man had given Dick the extra key to the desk, telling him to, keep it. The father trusted his three sons implicitly, only keeping to, himself such business affairs as he thought would not interest them.\\n\\nAlarmed, Tom picked up the tall, thin form and carried the man into, the house, for it was still raining, although not as hard as before., He placed Crabtree on an old couch in the sitting room and, getting, some water, laid a wet cloth over his bruised and swelling forehead., Knowing but little about broken limbs, he did not attempt to do, anything for the broken leg but placed that member out in a somewhat, straight position. He called up to Dick and told his brother of what, had happened.\\n\\nThe talk in the apartment went on, covering the things Belright Fogg, was to do while Pelter and Japson were in hiding in Canada. The, unscrupulous lawyer was to produce a power of attorney dated some days, before, so that he might act in place of the brokers. He was also to, do his best to help the brokers prove an alibi when accused of the, abduction of Anderson Rover.\\n\\nThe wedding was to take place at high noon, and long before that time, the many guests began to assemble at the church. Among the first to, arrive was Captain Putnam, in military uniform, and attended by about, a dozen of the Hall cadets. George Strong, the head teacher, was also, present, for he and Dick had always been good friends. Then came the, students from Brill, all in full dress, and led by William Philander, Tubbs, bedecked as only that dudish student would think of bedecking, himself.\\n\\nA discussion lasting the best part of half an hour ensued. The aviator, went up to four hundred dollars and then to four hundred and fifty., Finally, Dick said he would accept five hundred dollars cash; and the, bargain was concluded at that figure. The money was paid over, and the, Rover boys gave the purchaser a bill of sale, and he departed without, delay, stating he wished to make arrangements for shipping the wrecked, biplane away.\\n\\nSam and Tom got aboard and willing hands grasped the propellers and, gave each a twist. Bang! bang! bang! went the explosions, and soon the, propellers were revolving swiftly, and then with a swoop the Dartaway, ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose in the air. A, cheer went up, and the students threw up their caps. Then Dick swung, around in a quarter circle and headed directly for Plankville.\\n\\nYears before, and while their father was in Africa, the three boys had, been sent by their uncle to Putnam Hall Military Academy, as related, in detail in the first volume of this series, called \\\"The Rover Boys, at School.\\\" At the Hall they had made a number of friends, including, Songbird Powell and the dudish student, William Philander Tubbs. They, had also made some enemies, who did their best to bring the Rover boys, to grief, but without success.\\n\\nRunning along in the air is a different proposition from running on, the ground, and the air-man has to be careful about the lay of the, land below him or he will soon go astray from his course. The earth, looks altogether different when viewed from the sky from what it does, when looked at from a level, and when an air-man is five or six, hundred feet up he has all he can do to make out what is below him.\\n\\n\\\"I said this morning I had an idea, Tom,\\\" answered his big brother. \\\"I, don't know whether it will work out or not, or if you'll care to try, it. You know I told you to go to Central Park while Sam and I went, down to those offices. I did that so that those brokers wouldn't see, you. They don't know you, and you can go down and interview them as a, stranger. Do you catch the idea?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the Dartaway is gone--our dear old flying machine!\\\" groaned Tom., \\\"The machine we hoped to fly in to Washington, to the next, inauguration. Why, don't you know that the planes of that machine were, covered with the autographs of most of the big men of this country?, Whenever we sailed around to visit our friends or the big men we had, them write their autographs on the canvas wings of the machine. Those, autographs alone were worth about a million, more or less!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, something is bound to happen to those boys!\\\" murmured the aunt., \\\"You simply can't hold them in!\\\" And something did happen, and what is, was will be related in the next volume of this series, to be entitled:, \\\"The Rover Boys in Alaska; Or, Lost in the Fields of Ice.\\\" In that, book we shall learn how Tom suddenly lost his mind and wandered away, from home, and what strenuous things happened to Dick and Sam when, they went after their brother.\\n\\nfor a few days later William Philander and Clarabel Ruggles were seen, out driving together and apparently as friendly as over. The dudish, student had sent the young lady a letter stating he thought some of, his fellow collegians had doctored the box of candy, and this, explanation was accepted by the girl and her aunt. Then William, Philander sent the girl some candy he was sure was all right, and also, a big bouquet of roses; and that was the end of the unpleasantness.\\n\\nAfter that the captain was quite willing to talk, and he told how, Crabtree and Japson had come to him and questioned him about the, schooner, and finally chartered the craft for a week. They had at, first wanted to pay him at the end of the time, but he had insisted, upon receiving his money in advance and it was then paid over. He had, been told that the strange man was Crabtree's brother, who had gone, crazy because of the loss of his money in a Western irrigation scheme.\\n\\nA term at college had been followed by a trip down East, taken for a, peculiar reason, and then, while on a visit home, the three lads had, become the possessors of an up-to-date biplane, which they named the, Dartaway. In the biplane, as related in the volume before this, called, \\\"The Rover Boys in the Air,\\\" our heroes made a somewhat spectacular, trip from the farm to the college campus, much to the amazement of, their fellow collegians and their instructors. Later they made a trip, through the air to Hope Seminary, and at that time Dick was delighted, to place upon Dora's finger a diamond engagement sing.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't get the chance,\\\" returned the youngest Rover, answering the, last question first. \\\"It was on the corner below here. I was standing, in a doorway, watching up and down, when I saw a tall man come along, slowly. He halted at the corner and presently another man came out of, the side street and touched him on the arm. The second man wore a, heavy beard and a slouch hat and colored eyeglasses, but I am almost, sure it was Josiah Crabtree.\\\"\\n\\nDick had the address of the brokers in his pocket and the place was, easily found. The offices were located in an old building--one of the, oldest on the street, and also one of the shabbiest. But it was five, stories in height and boasted of two elevators, and was, from, appearances, filled with prosperous tenants. In Wall street rents are, so high that many a person doing business there is willing to take, whatever quarters he can get.\\n\\n\\\"No, I was out of town--calling on my mother, who is very old and, quite sick. There was a fire in the pantry off the kitchen, and for a, few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground. Of, course the guards got excited, and all they thought of was to put out, the blaze--and it's a good thing they did that. That's how the, prisoners got away. I suppose you've heard that we rounded up two of, them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is fairly well, but he gets a bad spell ever so often, and then to, attend to business is out of the question. But that isn't the worst of, it. He has gotten tangled up in some sort of financial scheme with, some brokers in New York City and it is worrying him half to death. He, has told me something about it, but I don't know half as much as I'd, like to know.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dartaway had a powerful motor, and once on the right trail the, eldest Rover advanced his gasoline and spark, and they went rushing, through the air at express-train speed. The boys were provided with, face guards, so they did not mind this. They did not fly high, and so, kept the railroad and other familiar objects fairly well in view. They, passed over several villages, the inhabitants gazing up at them in, open-mouthed wonder, and finally came in sight of a big church spire, that they knew belonged in Plankville. Then Dick slowed down the, engine, and soon they floated down in an open field close to the main, street and not a great distance from the sheriff's office and the, jail.\\n\\nA term at school had been followed by a short cruise on the ocean, and, then a trip to the jungles of Africa, whither the lads went to find, their father, who had disappeared. Then, during vacation, the boys, took a trip West, and then another trip on the Great Lakes. After that, they went in the mountains, and then came back to Putnam Hall, to go, into camp with their fellow cadets.\\n\\n\\\"In the morning, about ten o'clock. He came down in one of the, elevators with a small package in his hand--a package, so the, elevator man said, that looked like some legal documents. He seemed to, be very much disturbed, and the man said he talked to himself. He, hurried out of the side door of the hotel, but one of the doormen saw, him go to the corner and turn down Broadway--and that was the last, seen of him, so far as we knew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We ought to get a message from New York soon,\\\" remarked Dick, after, his uncle had related the little he had to tell about how Anderson, Rover had gone away on the trip to the metropolis. Evidently Randolph, Rover knew little about the business that had taken his brother to the, city. He was no business man himself--being wrapped up in what he, called scientific farming--and probably the boys' father had not, thought it worth while to take him into his confidence.\\n\\nAs my old readers well know, Dan Baxter was an old acquaintance of the, Rover boys. When at Putnam Hall he had been a great bully, and had, tried more than once to get the best of our heroes. But he had been, foiled, and then he had drifted to the West and South, and there the, Rovers had found him, away from home and practically penniless. They, had set him on his feet, and he had gotten a position as a traveling, salesman, and now he counted the Rovers his best friends, and was, willing to do anything for them.\\n\\nIn those days Josiah Crabtree had been an instructor at Putnam Hall., He was very dictatorial, and none of the cadets liked him, and the, Rovers liked him still less when they learned that he was trying to, practically hypnotize Mrs. Stanhope into marrying him, so that he, could get control of the fortune which the widow was holding in trust, for Dora. They foiled the teacher's efforts to wed the lady, and in, the end Josiah Crabtree had to leave Putnam Hall. Later still he was, arrested for some of his misdeeds and given a short sentence in jail.\\n\\nThe Stanhope fortune, as a part of the money coming to the Stanhopes, and the Lanings was called, had come to Mr. Stanhope in a peculiar, way, and some outsiders claimed the treasure, which, at that time, was, secreted in a spot among the West Indies called Treasure Isle. There, was a lively chase to get there first, but the Rovers won out, and, because of this their enemies were more bitter than ever.\\n\\nAs I have mentioned several times, in other volumes, this line was, started with the publication of \\\"The Rover Boys at School,\\\" \\\"On the, Ocean\\\" and \\\"In the Jungle.\\\" The cordial reception afforded the stories, called for the publication of the next volume, \\\"The Rover Boys Out, West,\\\" and then, year after year, by the issuing of \\\"On the Great, Lakes,\\\" \\\"In Camp,\\\" \\\"On Land and Sea,\\\" \\\"On the River,\\\" \\\"On the Plains,\\\", \\\"In Southern Waters,\\\" \\\"On the Farm,\\\" \\\"On Treasure Isle,\\\" \\\"At College,\\\", \\\"Down East,\\\" and then by \\\"In the Air,\\\" where we last met them.\"\n        ],\n
